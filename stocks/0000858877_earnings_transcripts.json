At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.\nNow I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nAhmed Sami Badri\n\nSenior Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Mark Patterson, our CFO.\nCisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website. Throughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis.\nPlease note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2026. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly in our most recent 10-K report, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.\nNow I'll turn it over to Chuck.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sami. And thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong start to fiscal '26 with Q1 revenue and earnings per share both coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. We delivered record Q1 revenue, putting Cisco on track to deliver our strongest year yet as indicated in our guidance for the full year.\nIn Q1, total revenue increased 8% year-over-year with product revenue up 10%, driven by robust demand for our AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Our strong top line performance, combined with operating efficiencies and solid execution by our teams contributed to non-GAAP EPS growth of 10% as we continue to grow earnings faster than revenue. We delivered solid margins and cash flows, allowing us to return $3.6 billion in capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing 125% of free cash flow in Q1. Additionally, we generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue and remaining cornice obligations, both of which continue to provide a strong foundation for our future performance in FY '26 and beyond.\nCisco's strong start to fiscal '26 as a testament to the critical role of secure networking and the strength of our portfolio as organizations look to deploy AI across their businesses. That said, we know many customers still have a lot of work to do to ensure they have the modern, scalable, secure networking infrastructure to support their AI goals.\nAccording to our 2025 global AI readiness index, only 1/3 of organizations fill their IT infrastructure can accommodate the needs of their planned AI projects, which creates a massive opportunity for Cisco. With our industry-leading networking portfolio powered by Silicon One, AI native security solutions and operating systems, we are well positioned today to provide the critical infrastructure for the AI era.\nNow let me comment on the strong demand we saw in Q1. Overall, total product orders grew 13% year-over-year, with growth across all geographies and customer markets. Enterprise product orders were up 4% year-over-year in Q1 on top of mid-teens growth, excluding Splunk a year ago, with strength in our campus switching and wireless solutions. Public sector orders were up 12% year-over-year with growth across all geographies and cohorts, including U.S. Federal. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers continue to be very strong, up 45% year-over-year driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers, even on a tough triple-digit growth comparison from Q1 of FY '25. Demand from telco customers was also strong in Q1 with orders growing more than 25% year-over-year.\nNow some color on demand from a product perspective. Networking product orders accelerated to high teens growth in Q1, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by hyperscale infrastructure, enterprise routing, campus switching, wireless, industrial IoT and servers. Within our campus networking portfolio, we are seeing very strong demand for switching, routing and wireless products, indicating that enterprise customers are investing in the connectivity needed for AI deployments. As early catalyst switching generations like the 4K and 6K near end of support, we see growing demand for our Cat9k series. Additionally, all of our next-generation solutions, including smart switches, secure routers and WiFi 7 wireless products are ramping faster than in prior product launches. This marks the beginning of a multiyear, multibillion-dollar refresh opportunity.\nWe're also seeing consistent progress across our industrial IoT portfolio including new ruggedized equipment with orders growing more than 25% year-over-year in Q1. We expect this demand to increase driven by onshoring of manufacturing to the United States, the increase of AI workloads at the network edge and the emergence of physical AI. AI infrastructure orders taken from hyperscalers in Q1 totaled $1.3 billion, balanced between Silicon One Systems and Optics. Marking a significant acceleration in growth and demonstrating our strength for advanced AI use cases. We expect to recognize roughly $3 billion in AI infrastructure revenue from hyperscalers in fiscal year '26.\nAs these hyperscale customers look to extend AI clusters across their infrastructure, we see robust demand for Acacia's market-leading coherent pluggable optics, offering significant cost and power savings. All hyperscalers are now customers of these products. In Q1, we also announced our latest Cisco [ 8223-router ], powered by our [ Silicon P200 ] chip. This first-to-market 51.2 terabits per second fixed Ethernet routing system is designed for the intense AI workload traffic between data centers. With Silicon One's unmatched scalability, power efficiency and programmability, we can provide the performance and speed across data centers that would have previously only been possible within a data center with a switching infrastructure.\nDemand for Silicon One continues to grow, and we expect to ship our 1 millionth chip in Q2 of fiscal year '26. Product orders for AI use cases beyond hyperscaler training are also gaining traction with orders for data center systems, including switching and compute, growing double digits in Q1 as customers prepare their networks for inferencing and agentic workflows. We see a growing pipeline in excess of $2 billion for our high-performance networking products across sovereign, neo-cloud and enterprise customers. To capture this opportunity, we continue to make progress both within our own portfolio and across our strategic partnerships.\nWe recently announced an expansion of our partnership with G42 in the UAE to power, connect and secure G42's large-scale AI clusters featuring AMD GPUs. Other strategic partnerships in the region, including HUMAIN and Stargate UAE, are progressing as planned. We also launched our sovereign critical infrastructure portfolio for European customers to operate in their own air gap on-prem physical environments. This includes our networking and collaboration products, enhanced by security and observability.\nIn addition, Cisco announced an expansion of our NVIDIA partnership and our new N9100 switch based on Spectrum-X silicon. We are now the first NVIDIA partner to offer networking compliant with their cloud reference architecture. The N9100 available in the second half of fiscal year '26 will provide the operational consistency and flexibility needed for sovereign and neo-cloud providers to build and manage AI at scale. We are also delivering new capabilities and features for Cisco Secure AI factory with NVIDIA announced in Q3 of fiscal year '25. These advancements strengthen our commitment to high performance, secure and trusted AI infrastructure globally. We expect Cisco's AI opportunity across sovereign neo-cloud and enterprise customers to ramp in the second half of fiscal year '26.\nNow shifting to security. We continue to see order growth for our new and refreshed products which comprise around 1/3 of our security portfolio and includes secure access, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense and our refreshed firewalls. Nearly 3,000 customers have purchased a new product since launch, and we saw mid-teens growth in demand for our next-generation firewalls in Q1. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our prior generation platforms. We continue to see strong performance from Splunk, closing one of our largest Splunk deals to date in Q1 enabled by joint Cisco and Splunk sales engagement. Splunk's ARR and product RPO grew double digits as we saw a notable change in how customers consume Splunk offerings in Q1 with a shift to more cloud subscriptions and fewer on-premise deals.\nRevenue for cloud subscriptions is recognized ratably, whereas product revenue for on-prem deals is recognized on delivery. While this shift negatively impacted security revenue growth in Q1, it is purely a timing issue. We are actually pleased to see more cloud subscriptions for Splunk as they enable greater adoption and expansion and allow us to deliver innovation faster to enable customers to unlock value from AI.\nNow let me comment on some of our recent innovations. As we look at the AI opportunity, we see customer use cases growing across training, inferencing and connectivity with secured networking increasingly critical as workloads move from the data center to end users, devices and agents at the edge. As mentioned last quarter, agents are transforming network traffic from predictable bursts to persistent high-intensity loads with Agentic AI queries generating up to 25x more network traffic than chatbots. Instead of pulling data to and from the data center, AI workloads require models and infrastructure to be closer to where data is created and decisions are made, particularly in industries such as retail, health care and manufacturing. This is why we introduced Cisco Unified Edge last week, an industry-first converged platform for the network edge, integrating compute, networking and storage into a single system. Unified Edge enables real-time inferencing for agentic and physical AI workloads, so enterprises can confidently deploy and manage AI at scale.\nWe also announced Cisco Data Fabric in September. A Splunk powered architecture to unify and manage machine data across various sources, allowing enterprises to build AI models with their previously unused proprietary data. As always, these innovations are designed to further Cisco's platform advantage where every new technology investment compounds the value of a customer's existing investment.\nTo summarize, we are seeing strong demand across all customer markets and geographies as well as expanded opportunities as our customers power their AI use cases from the data center to the edge. We continue to innovate at unprecedented scale to build AI-ready data centers, power future-proof workplaces and create a foundation of digital resilience. And our strong performance is fueling our capital allocation model, returning significant value to our shareholders while positioning our business for Cisco's strongest year yet in fiscal '26 as indicated in our guidance.\nNow I'll turn it over to Mark for more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Strategy Officer\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter to launch our new fiscal year with revenue, operating margin and earnings per share all above the high end of our guidance, coupled with solid gross margin and operating cash flow.\nFor the quarter, total revenue was $14.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1, up 10%, demonstrating continuing operating leverage with non-GAAP earnings growing faster than revenue.\nLooking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 10%, and service revenue was $3.8 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Networking was a standout with growth of 15% with strength across the portfolio, led by high double-digit growth in service provider routing, which was largely driven by revenue from AI infrastructure. Data Center switching and enterprise routing also contributed double-digit growth in campus switching had growth in the high single digits. Security was down 2%, reflecting declines in prior generation products and a shift to cloud subscriptions in our Splunk business that Chuck referenced, partially offset by growth in Secure Firewall, Duo and SASE. Collaboration was down 3%, reflecting declines in devices and WebEx. Observability was up 6%, primarily driven by growth in ThousandEyes.\nLooking at our recurring metrics. Total RPO was $42.9 billion, up 7%. Product RPO grew 10%, of which the long-term portion was $11.8 billion, up 13%. Total ARR ended the quarter at $31.4 billion, an increase of 5% with product ARR growth of 7%. Total subscription revenue was $8 billion and represented 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 3% to $5.7 billion. Q1 product orders were up 13% year-over-year. Product orders were up across all geographic segments, with the Americas up 16% and EMEA up 8%; and APJC up 13%. Product orders were also up across all customer markets with service provider and cloud up 45%, public sector up 12% and enterprise up 4%.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.1%, down 120 basis points year-over-year but coming in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.2%, down 170 basis points, driven by negative impacts from mix and pricing, partially offset by productivity improvements. Non-GAAP services gross margin was [ 70.7% ], up 40 basis points. We continue our focus on enhancing profitability and driving financial discipline. With non-GAAP operating margin at 34.4%, above the high end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for the quarter.\nShifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $15.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion, down 12% due to investments to meet growing customer demand for AI infrastructure. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2 billion of share repurchases, with $12.2 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.\nTo summarize, we had a solid start to fiscal 2026 with top and bottom line performance exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins all demonstrating the power of our innovation engine to drive strong top line growth as well as operating leverage to fuel profitability. We remain focused on making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. This will continue to be underpinned by disciplined spend management and it's this powerful combination that continues to fuel strong cash flow and our ability to return significant value to our shareholders.\nTurning to guidance. Please note our Q2 and fiscal year 2026 guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the end of fiscal 2026. These assumptions remain unchanged from our prior guidance with the exception of the [ China fentanyl ] tariff being reduced from 20% to 10%. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue our focus on durable growth with financial discipline, driving operating leverage and continued capital returns.\nFor fiscal Q2, our guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $15 billion to $15.2 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.01 to $1.03. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. For fiscal year '26, our guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $60.2 billion to $61 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $4.08 to $4.14.\nSami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nAhmed Sami Badri\n\nSenior Analyst\n\nThank you, Mark.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Mark Patterson, our CFO. Cisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website. Throughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2026.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Now, I'll turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal 2025, delivering revenue and gross margin at the high end of our guidance ranges for the 4Q. Continued operating leverage across our business produced strong profitability, with earnings per share above the high end of our guidance. In addition, we generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue, which provides a strong foundation for our future performance. The profitable growth of our business continues to produce strong cash flows, supporting our commitment to deliver consistent capital returns.\nIn Q4, we returned $2.9 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the total return in fiscal 2025 to $12.4 billion in value, or 94% of free cash flow, surpassing the $12.1 billion Cisco returned to shareholders in fiscal 2024. Overall, our FY 2025 performance has established a solid foundation as we turn our focus to delivering Cisco's strongest year yet in fiscal year 2026, as indicated in our guidance. As we move into the next phase of AI, with agents autonomously conducting tasks alongside humans, the capacity requirements of the network will be compounded to accommodate both unprecedented levels of network traffic and an increasing threat landscape.\nAccording to our survey of IT networking leaders, 97% of businesses believe they need to upgrade their networks to successfully deploy AI. Having refreshed almost our entire product portfolio with industry-leading networking systems powered by Silicon One, AI-native security solutions, and software operating systems, Cisco is well-positioned to provide the critical infrastructure needed for the AI era. Now, let me comment on the demand we saw in Q4, starting with record AI infrastructure orders received from WebSkill customers.\nThese orders exceeded $800 million in the quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2025 to over $2 billion, more than double our original $1 billion target stated in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. This demonstrates the undeniable capability and relevance of our technology for multiple back-end use cases with some of the most technologically advanced customers. Overall, total product orders in Q4 grew 7% year-over-year, with solid growth across all geographies despite a complex environment, demonstrating the valuable outcomes we continue to deliver for customers worldwide.\nEnterprise product orders were up 5% year-over-year in Q4. As typical for the fourth quarter, we closed several very large deals with major enterprises across different industries, who are compounding the value of their investments by leveraging the full breadth of our technology platforms. We have a slide in our earnings presentation that highlights both the breadth of Cisco's reach through eight-figure or larger deals, and the versatility of solutions tailored to our customers' needs. Public sector orders were down 6% year-over-year in Q4, compared with a very strong fourth quarter in FY 2024 when orders grew double digits year-over-year.\nThat said, overall public sector demand grew sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers continue to be very strong, up 49% year-over-year, driven by triple-digit order growth in WebSkill for the fourth consecutive quarter, with four out of the top six WebSkill customers each growing orders in the triple digits. In fact, two WebSkill customers each placed total orders of over $1 billion for networking, security, collaboration, and observability in FY 2025.\nDemand from telco and cable customers was also strong in Q4, with orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. Now, some color on demand for our core networking and security solutions. Networking product orders grew double digits in Q4, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by WebSkill infrastructure, switching, enterprise routing, industrial IoT, and servers.\nThere is strong interest from customers in the new family of Cisco Catalyst 9000 smart switches, along with a completely refreshed lineup of highly secure routers, wireless access points, and industrial IoT devices, which are purpose-built for the AI-ready campus and branch. Our new smart switches are powered by Silicon One and deliver enhanced performance, quantum-secure networking, and radically simplified cloud-native and AI-driven operations, all supporting the new realities as AI changes how we work and collaborate.\nThe introduction of our new switches marks the beginning of a major multi-year refresh cycle opportunity for Cisco's large installed campus switching base. Orders for our industrial IoT portfolio, comprised of ruggedized Catalyst products, grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, and we see solid demand signals continuing into FY 2026 as countries around the world are committing to US domestic investments as part of their trade agreements.\nAs more strategic infrastructure and manufacturing is brought onshore to the United States, Cisco is well-positioned to help connect and protect these capital-intensive investments at scale. As I mentioned earlier, the AI infrastructure orders we received from webscale customers were once again exceptionally strong, exceeding $800 million in the quarter. As expected, the product mix of these orders was more than two-thirds in systems, with the remainder in optics.\nIn the enterprise specifically, while still early, AI orders are ramping, and we have a growing pipeline in the hundreds of millions as these customers look to Cisco to provide simple, scalable, and secure solutions for the AI era. Our expanding partnership with NVIDIA also positions us to deliver on these new demands with completed integrations of Cisco Nexus switches with NVIDIA's Spectrum-X architecture, offering low-latency, high-speed networking for AI clusters.\nAdditionally, the Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA provides a trusted blueprint for building secure, AI-ready data centers for enterprises, sovereign cloud providers, and newly emerging neocloud providers. We also see the opportunity with neocloud providers ramping, with several large deals in Q4 not included in the previously mentioned AI infrastructure orders. Our newly forged Middle East strategic partnerships, including Humain, G42, and Stargate UAE, are all progressing as planned, and we expect the sovereign AI opportunity to build momentum in the second half of fiscal year 2026.\nWe believe Cisco will be a core system provider for these significant AI training and inference cluster buildouts, and integral to their development and eventual hyperscaling. As we look holistically at the AI opportunity for Cisco, we frame it into three distinct but connected pillars. First, AI training infrastructure for webscale customers. Combinations of our Cisco 8K, Silicon One, optics, and optical systems are being deployed by the largest webscalers, and we expect demand for these technologies from neocloud providers and sovereign customers to increase in fiscal year 2026. Second, AI inference and enterprise clouds.\nOur accelerated innovation in hardware and software, coupled with our NVIDIA partnership, is designed to simplify, accelerate, and de-risk AI infrastructure deployments for the enterprise. Third, AI network connectivity. Customers are leveraging Cisco platforms to help modernize, secure, and automate their network operations to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI agents and applications. As we move towards agentic AI and the demand for inferencing expands to the enterprise and end-user networking environments, traffic on the network will reach unprecedented levels. Network traffic will not only increase beyond the peaks of current chatbot interaction, but will remain consistently high, with agents in constant interaction.\nWe have a slide illustrating this new traffic model in our earnings presentation available on our website. As agents gain autonomous decision-making and action capabilities, security will be even more critical to ensure they operate reliably and safely. As a trusted partner for enterprises, hyperscalers, neocloud, and sovereign cloud providers alike, Cisco has the opportunity to lead this generational transition in networking and security, and provide the critical infrastructure needed for the AI\nera. Now shifting to security, we recorded mid-single-digit growth in orders in Q4. Splunk and Cisco synergies delivered a 14% year-over-year increase in new logos for Splunk in Q4, demonstrating the benefit of our cross-selling motions and joint innovation. Our new and refreshed products, including Secure Access, XDR, Hypershield, and AI Defense, also continue to ramp and added 750 new customers collectively in the quarter. The vast majority of our new Hypershield enterprise customers are bundling with our N9300 smart switch, which enables them to embed security directly into the fabric of the network.\nWe believe that agentic AI can only be secured by fusing security deep into the network, and that only Cisco can deliver this capability. Now, I'd like to comment on our accelerating innovation pipeline. At Cisco Live US in June, we delivered our largest innovation payload to date, announcing over 20 new customer-centric offerings across our portfolio to help our customers build AI-ready data centers and future-proof their workplaces with a foundational layer of digital resilience.\nYou can see the full list of product launches in our slide deck, but I'd like to highlight our agentic ops, which are already resonating with customers. Cisco AI Canvas is a revolutionary generative user interface for real-time collaboration between network and security teams, optimized for both human and agent interaction.Powered by Cisco's advanced deep network model LLM, AI Canvas unifies real-time telemetry across various platforms to radically simplify IT operations and accelerate troubleshooting. All of our new innovations introduced in FY 2025, spanning core networking products based on Cisco Silicon One, advanced security technologies, and unified management tools, are designed on a foundation of AI, further enhancing Cisco's platform advantage, where every technology doesn't just add value by itself, but compounds the value of our customers' existing investments.\nWe continue to use GenAI and agentic systems across our customer experience organization with things like services as code and AI agents for in-product support, renewals, and adoption. Today, over two-thirds of support cases are touched by AI and automation, which increases the proportion of complex cases we can solve within one day. We're also seeing increased usage of Cisco's own proprietary AI application internally, with more advanced use cases emerging across engineering, sales, operations, and our people policy and purpose organization, resulting in meaningful productivity gains for our teams.\nTo summarize, we are seeing clear demand for our technology across customer markets, in addition to expanded opportunities as we move towards agentic AI. We are innovating faster than ever before, making AI foundational in our designs, fusing security deep into our networking products, and providing operational simplicity for our customers. Our strong performance is fueling our capital allocation model, returning significant value to our shareholders while positioning our business for success in fiscal 2026. Before I close, I'd like to once again thank Scott Herren for his leadership and partnership over the last five years.\nScott has been instrumental in driving our transition to more software and recurring revenue, which has driven greater predictability for our business and increased shareholder value. We wish you all the best in your retirement. I'd also like to take a moment to thank our teams for their hard work to close out the year, for executing with urgency as One Cisco, and, most importantly, for their unfailing focus on delivering valuable outcomes for our customers. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, and operating margin at the high end of our guidance range, and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance, coupled with solid operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNon-GAAP net income was $4 billion, up 12%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.99, up 14%, demonstrating good operating leverage with EPS growth outpacing revenue growth. Before we dive into the details, it's worth reiterating as a reminder that we had a full 13-week contribution from Splunk in Q4 FY 2024 last year, so our reported year-over-year growth rates are fully comparable this quarter.\nLooking at our Q4 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.9 billion, up 10%. Services revenue was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Networking was up 12%, with growth across most of the portfolio, led by double-digit growth in internet infrastructure and enterprise routing, as well as solid growth in switching, partially offset by a decline in servers. Security was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in our offerings from Splunk and SASE. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by solid growth in devices.\nObservability was up 4%, led by strong growth in Splunk and ThousandEyes. Looking at our recurring metrics, total RPO was $43.5 billion, up 6%. Product RPO grew 8%, and total short-term RPO was $21.7 billion, up 4%. Total ARR ended the quarter at $31.1 billion, an increase of 5%, with product ARR growth of 8%. Total subscription revenue increased 3% to $7.9 billion and represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue.

Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.5%, up 50 basis points, driven by productivity improvements.\nNon-GAAP services gross margin was 70.8%, also up 50 basis points. Our total gross margin included a small impact from tariffs, which was slightly favorable compared to our estimate that was included in our guidance. We continue our focus on profitability and financial discipline, with non-GAAP operating margin at 34.3%, at the high end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.1% for the quarter. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $16.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, up 14%, primarily driven by our revenue and earnings growth.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of our share repurchases, with $14.2 billion now remaining under our share repurchase program. Turning to the full fiscal year, revenue was $56.7 billion, up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 68.7%, up 120 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion, flat year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.81, which was up 2%.\nOperating cash flow was $14.2 billion, up 30% compared to FY 2024. Cash flow growth from the full year was positively impacted by some large tax payments in early FY 2024 that did not repeat in FY 2025. We returned $12.4 billion in value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. This was comprised of $6.4 billion in quarterly cash dividends and $6 billion of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 14th consecutive year in FY 2025, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.\nTo summarize, we had a solid fiscal quarter and year, with top and bottom line performance meeting and exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins. For the full fiscal 2025, we delivered record non-GAAP operating income and margin, demonstrating our ability to provide operating leverage while driving strong top-line growth. We remain focused on making strategic investments and innovation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. This will continue to be underpinned by disciplined spend management, and it's this powerful combination that continues to fuel strong cash flow and our ability to return significant value to our shareholders.\nTurning to guidance, while we have some clarity on tariffs, we are still operating in a complex environment. Our Q1 and fiscal year 2026 guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the end of fiscal 2026. These include the following. China at 30%, partially offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components, Mexico at 25%, and Canada at 35% for the components and products that are not eligible for the current USMCA exemptions.\nOther countries reverted to country-specific reciprocal rates, largely offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components. Finally, a small impact from tariffs on copper, steel, and aluminum and retaliatory tariffs. We will continue to leverage our world-class supply chain team to help mitigate the impact of tariffs where appropriate. Through the flexibility and agility we have built into our operations over the last few years, the size and scale of our supply chain provide us with some unique advantages as we support our customers globally. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue our focus on durable growth with financial discipline, driving operating leverage and continued capital returns.\nOur fiscal Q1 guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $14.65 billion to 14.85 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67.5% to 68.5. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.97 to 0.99. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. For fiscal year 2026, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $59 billion to 60 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range from $4.00 to 4.06. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Mark. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Michelle, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nYeah, thanks, Stella, for taking the question.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nI guess my first question is, looking at your guidance and given the commentary around the AI opportunity and reflective of sovereign starting to kick in into the second half of the fiscal year, just kind of taking the midpoint, it would seem to assume you've got some deceleration of growth from, call it, 6.5%, 7%, guided for fiscal first quarter to about 4.5% going into the remaining three quarters. I'm curious, does that reflect conservatism? Is there any change in the demand environment that you're factoring in? I'm kind of curious how we bridge maybe that deceleration through the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.\nHey, Aaron, thanks. Let me just say that the AI opportunity is clearly one that we have been pleased with our execution on. As we look out at you, I think the dynamic that you're talking about is strictly connected to just year-over-year comps later in the year. I don't think it's got, it's not meant to signal any change in demand or anything that we think. I think one of the questions that I expect is, does the campus refresh begin to kick in, and should that be a big revenue driver in next fiscal year?\nIf you think about the campus, the Catalyst 9000 is in year eight of this transition. Lots of customers will take a lot of time to evaluate that and look at those products before they begin to deploy them. We think that's going to kick in next year as well, and we're pleased with the progress we made on AI. I think the annual progression is really related to comps. Mark, you have anything to add?\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, I think that's right, Chuck. You have to think back as well. In prior year, other than Q4, that's the first quarter that really was apples-to-apples in terms of having Splunk in the prior year. Some of the growth rates before Q4 were obviously higher than they would be otherwise.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nEmina Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nEmina Marshall\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. Appreciate the question. Maybe a couple for me. Just one, how are you looking at security and business, maybe in particular? You're now anniversary Splunk, as you guys just mentioned, but just kind of how are you looking at the growth outlook there as you have some kind of new products and old products cascading in? Then maybe second, just new CFO priorities would be great to kind of level set. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right. Why don't I cover security, and Mark, you can obviously cover CFO priorities.\nEmina, thanks for the questions. I would say that I am more optimistic about security coming out of the last quarter, and I'll tell you why. Last quarter, I explained to all of you that we really have two sets of products. We have the set that is new and refreshed, and that's the SASE, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense, as well as our refreshed firewall portfolio., and then we have the area of older products that are not huge investment areas for us right now, are kind of the long tail of the life cycle. If you look at those new products and new and refreshed, again, including our refreshed firewalls, we saw order growth during the quarter in excess of 20%. They continue to have widespread adoption.\nPerhaps the metric that I think will give you more confidence here is, if you take out US Federal, which had a tough year, as we all know, the rest of world security order growth in Q4 was up double digits. We're seeing this ramp. I think I said on last call, it's happening slower than I had anticipated. A lot of it's because this stuff is ratable. I feel good about where we are. We have 80 new Hypershield customers, largely connected to this new smart switch. That strategy is working. I would say that we had 480+ new SSE customers during the quarter. Our secure services edge is really getting good traction.\nWhat I would say is, based on how we see this stuff evolving, I would see the growth rate continuing to improve as we get through the fiscal year this year. That's the story on security. Mark, you want to take the second question?\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure. Thanks, Emina, for your question. First off, I just want to thank Scott. Been certainly a good partner for many years and for the work that he's done with Cisco. In particular, I think helping us make that transition to software and subscription. I've been with the company now 25 years in a variety of roles and responsibilities. I think as I look ahead, we have significant opportunity, whether it's in AI infrastructure in the web scale space, now in the nascent but growing enterprise AI opportunity.\nObviously, neoclouds and the Soverin AI buildout happening. Also, you look to cybersecurity and how we've improved our hand there with Splunk, and then the campus refresh that we've got ahead of us, which will be multi-year. I think we've got great opportunity. What I really want to do is make sure that we're funded for success. We're looking at those opportunities for what do we need to do to be successful. I also think in terms of expectations of me, you can expect that I will be focused on durable, profitable growth, obviously, financial discipline and transparency, and really just returning value to the shareholders. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks. I want to add one more thing, Emina, on the security front that I failed to mention. Another positive thing that happened during the quarter, we've had two consecutive quarters now relative to Splunk. If you recall, one of the big things that we thought we could do is bring them new customers by cross-selling Splunk into customers they had not been in. In Q3 and Q4, we had over 300 new logos for Splunk, new customers that bought Splunk for the first time, so that strategy seems to be working.\nThe teams are doing a really good job there, which is another reason I have confidence in the security strategy this year.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nEmina, thank you for the question. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you very much for taking the question. First one, I wanted to ask about this idea of pull forwards. I appreciate customers may not communicate their rationale and reasons for placing particular orders, but I'm concerned that, particularly in the federal vertical with potential budget cuts and enterprises worried about the implications from tariffs, may have accelerated some of the orders, therefore pulling them from the later quarters. As my follow-up, I'm wondering if you could talk about your expectations over the longer term for the composition of the AI business.\nWe've got the two-thirds, one-third split between systems and optics, and I'm wondering how you expect that to trend, or is this an expected steady state? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Simon. I'll make a couple of comments on the pull forward. Mark, you can give some data points on why we're pretty confident that hasn't happened at scale. We've looked at lots of metrics that we look at here. I talk to customers constantly. We talk to our field teams constantly, and I haven't heard one instance in the last six months of a single customer who said, I'm going to order this now before price increases occur, not that we're increasing prices. We haven't announced anything like that, but I'm just saying that's the theory that you're putting forward. I'm not suggesting that it hasn't happened somewhere, but I think I would have heard it if it was pervasive. Mark?\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, just to add maybe a few data points. Certainly, we talked to many channel partners. We also look at our typical linearity from month one, two, three, etc. That all look good. On many of our products, we actually have software that gets activated once it's shipped. One of the things we look at is really that time from shipment to activation and to see if that is stretched out at all. It did not as well. We also look at ship dates requested from customers. If those are sliding, that might be an indication that they do not really want the gear yet, but they wanted to get an order in early. Did not see any issue there either. Really, just, of course, we looked at pipeline pull forwards and nothing unusual there either. We are pretty confident that we have not seen any indication of any pull forwards.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks. Simon, on your second question, the AI business composition, specifically in the backend networks today of the cloud providers, I do not see anything that would indicate a massive shift there. Based on the conversations we are having with them, I have not heard anything that would lead me to believe that that shift changes meaningfully.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Simon. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nYep. Great. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe, Chuck, if I can sort of ask you more on the networking cycle here, particularly that there was a period of time that you went through a digestion with customers and then you started to see the recovery in the networking cycle, there have been two quarters of solid growth on that front. As you think about next year or fiscal 2026, how do you sort of see that growth sustaining, particularly if we sort of put aside the new upgrades in relation to Catalyst 9000 upgrades that you are looking at? Where are customers in terms of their intent to upgrade legacy infrastructure? Basically, what I am trying to get to is that at the Investor Day, you had talked about 2% to 5 being the range of networking through the medium term. Where do you think you land on that front in fiscal 2026? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Samik. I think that if you step back, there are two things going on. There is this AI revolution that we can talk about, and then there is the refresh opportunity. If you think about the AI revolution, what we are seeing, and we have seen this with transitions over the last decade or so, is that we tend to see these things begin first in the cloud providers, which we are clearly seeing the AI play in the cloud providers. Then we see it shift into the enterprise. We see it shift from the backend, in this case, from the backend to the frontend. We believe that will occur as enterprises start using more of these services. Enterprises will also build out inferencing, as we know, on-prem in addition to that.\nWe're even seeing the telco business actually pick up as they're actually telling us they're increasing their network capacity and they're modernizing their infrastructure in preparation for AI. We think the AI is going to drive network modernization across all of these segments. You have the campus upgrade, which we really haven't started yet. If you think about the comment I made earlier, we've got routing refresh. We've got a lot of new technology in our data center networking business, which, by the way, grew mid-teens orders last fiscal year in the enterprise. We have Wi-Fi 7, which grew triple digits year over year, so we're seeing good uptake there. We got the new campus products, but the new campus switching—again, we're in year eight of the Cat 9K.\nHonestly, if you look at products that were pre-Catalyst 9000 that are still installed in our customer base, there's tens of billions of dollars of install base that's there that we can go after. We think that all of that leads us to feel very confident about maintaining the range that we provided in analyst day on core networking.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just have two as well. First, on AI, I was wondering if you could talk about the greater than $2 billion AI orders this year. Did that translate into revenue in the year, and how should we think about that translating into revenue for next? Second, just on networking, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the orders in the quarter by subsegment—campus and data center switching, wireless, routing—and any kind of notable inflections that you would call out in any of those product categories. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure, Michael. Let me take some comments first on the—I want to just give the clarity on the web scale business and what it looked like, and then Mark can talk about the revenue in FY 2025 related to their AI infrastructure orders. I just want to make sure everybody understands our web scale business. First of all, we sell technology into the back end. We sell technology into the front end or the traditional cloud networks, and we sell our enterprise portfolio to these customers as well.\nIf you look at our entire portfolio, these customers in aggregate grew triple digits four quarters in a row from an orders perspective. We had four of them that grew triple digits in Q4 by themselves. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had two of these customers across the portfolio that placed orders in excess of $1 billion each in fiscal year 2025. If you think back five years ago when we were talking about our strategy in this space, this was definitely not the case, so we feel good about the progress we made. I think you understood on the AI infrastructure, we had greater than $800 million in orders during the quarter, and we have greater than $2 billion on the year, more than double our original target. Mark, you want to talk a little bit about the revenue?\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure. Yeah. In terms of revenue and shipments related to those AI orders, those really just progressed and ramped like we expected during FY 2025. For the full year, we recognized right about $1 billion in revenue related to those.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nWe recognize roughly $1 billion of revenue on the AI backend orders that we've taken from the web scale customers during fiscal year 2025.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Michael. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore, you may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Analyst, Evercore\n\nYep. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. Chuck, maybe just on the AI side, as you were talking about that a little bit here, can you just touch on AI adoption by enterprises? How do you really think that opportunity on the enterprise side shapes up, given I think Silicon One is the only partner silicon that NVIDIA is supporting right now? Can you talk about how big you think this enterprise opportunity is and when you start to see revenues or orders flow into that?\nMy follow-up, maybe just continuing on to the prior answer you folks had, how much revenue contribution are you embedding in fiscal 2026 from AI, given the $2 billion order that you had this year? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Amit, good question. On the enterprise side, what we saw orders, and these are orders that are really sort of networking and AI GPU related. I think in our remarks we talked about earlier, they're about half and half. We saw a few $100 million that moved through, and we have hundreds of millions in the pipeline right now for enterprise. I'd say that there's a lot of pilots going. There's a lot of work going on with customers who are piloting different applications in retail environments, etc.\nWe think it'll start to ramp. We think that you'll see AI applications ramp. In the second half of the year, we think you're going to see agentic proof of concepts become more, I'd say, pervasive. That's going to require, obviously, network connectivity, network capacity, low latency. Candidly, we're going to have to put security into the fabric of the network because, as we talked about earlier, these agentic workflows, they're going to be in constant communication.\nWhether you think about general agents or you think about robotics, the importance of the low latency connectivity is going to be huge, and the security is going to be huge. The only way to do both of those is to fuse security into the core of the network. That's our plan. That's why we're working so hard on what we're working on. In the NVIDIA space, I'd say a lot of the development's going on. I would just say I don't believe we've seen the meaningful benefit of that partnership yet. We've got some good development that's been completed. We got a lot of milestones that are going to be done in the next few months. We think that as the enterprise really begins to ramp up, that partnership and our portfolio, we think, will be in good shape to help them out.\nOn the revenue contribution from fiscal year 2026 relative to AI, I would just say that we don't really guide by specific parts of the technology. Given that we had $1 billion in FY 2025, you can probably extrapolate out what you think we'll do in 2026 because we got the backlog and we'll have the new orders that we take down during the year.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Amit. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes. Hi, guys. Two questions. I'll ask them both together. Service revenues, kind of 25% of revenues, flat this quarter. If you look at the trend line over the last five quarters, the growth decelerated from 6.5% to 5.5 to 2.5, now zero. What are the trends in service revenues and what should we expect going forward? That's question number one.\nQuestion number two is, the networking growth, it's driven by spending and investments by cloud. How much risk is there that this year is a phenomenal year for spending and trends would slow down next year just because Oracle is not going to grow again another 150% and Meta is not going to grow again another 70%, 80, etc.? What's the sustainability of these growth rates in your view? Thanks.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Hey, Tal, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. I think I'll take the service one, and I'll let Chuck answer your second question. On the services, if you go back a year ago and even a little bit longer ago, you saw a lot of professional services that we did, really helping our customers and our partners, frankly, working hand in hand to implement a lot of that gear that we had shipped. If you remember all that excess backlog that we sort of unloaded on our customers, if you will, we were helping do that. so tat drove nice growth in our services business for a while.\nWhat we usually do see, as you know, is services usually trails or sort of follows on to what's happening in product, for instance. As we saw networking growth of 12% this quarter, I would expect that you'll start to see services pick up, as revenue on services is ratable. We do expect that will improve as we go into FY 2026.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOn the risk issue, all I can say, Tal, is that we see the same CapEx year-over-year growth numbers that you see. I think the aggregate number is like 50% up. I don't feel like AI is a fleeting trend, I do understand your question, but I think we're operating off the demand signals we're getting from those customers and what they're signaling relative to how they're spending CapEx.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Tal. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Mellius Research, you may go ahead, sir..\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Technology Research Analyst, Mellius Research\n\nHey, thanks. Chuck, I mean, I think some folks were trying to get at this in an earlier question, but security, I mean, your execution in switching and the AI stuff is obviously better than expected, but the security was pretty well below the street and has to accelerate pretty significantly to get to your 15% to 17 growth for security plus observability long-term target. I mean, is that still the right way to think of that business, Chuck? Is that where you think you can at least end the year? If not, is it worth rethinking that it's a high single-digit grower? Just wondering on that. I have a quick follow-up.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThat's enough.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nBen, do you want to go ahead and ask the second one now?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nBen, we're writing them down, so.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Technology Research Analyst, Mellius Research\n\nOh, okay. I was just on the, I was wondering on the Humain and some of these sovereigns. You mentioned the NVIDIA deal so much, but on one of them, you're working with AMD. I'm just wondering, with regard to your partnering outside of NVIDIA in the AI land, how much is that a focus? Is that something that you're able to do as well?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. First of all, I gave you the data earlier when I was talking about security. I talked about the fact that Xfed, we saw security orders grow in double digits, which is pretty positive compared to where we've been. These new and refreshed products that I talked about included Secure Access, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense, new firewalls, and identity, which is super important these days in agentic, the refreshed identity portfolio. We saw that grow in excess of 20%, and that's currently about two-thirds of the organic security portfolio.\nThrough the year, what you're going to see is that just continue to become a bigger and bigger part so that the third that's sort of the legacy stuff will have a lower impact, will continue to have a lower and lower negative impact on that as we get through the year. To answer your question directly, number one, I don't think we should change those ranges. Number two, do I believe we'll exit the year at it? I think we're going to exit the year either near it or on a path to get there pretty soon after that.\nThat's first. On the Humain and on the sovereign side, we are working very closely with AMD on a couple of those. You should assume that we will have a very, very tight partnership with them as well, primarily so that we can deliver highly integrated solutions to these customers as we work with them going forward. Lisa and I talk fairly regularly. As you all know, she used to be on our board, so we have a great relationship. You should assume that we'll have a tight partnership where we need to deliver outcomes for these customers.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Ben. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nJames Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Fish\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, thanks for the questions here, guys. I know Chuck and Meta asked about this a little bit earlier. Is there a way to think about for every dollar of Catalyst 9000 refresh, how many dollars are kind of coming off of the other solutions, be it wireless LAN, firewall, other security products? Just to follow up on the last question here, anniversary and Splunk, how are you guys thinking about your own use of capital, given big M&A and security?\nOnce again, I'm surprised I'm the first one to ask about this given the CyberArk deal. How are you thinking about that identity and privilege access space, given you're going to have more AI to AI or machine to machine interactions occurring in the future?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Mark, feel free to comment. I don't think there's a way to really correlate. I didn't completely understand that first question about the correlation.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I think he's asking, can you correlate the Catalyst 9000 to sort of other campus devices around it, if you will? It actually sounds like a great idea. I'd love for that model. There are so many other new devices that we launched as well, if you will. I mean, the smart routers, the smart switches, but also new Wi-Fi access points, etc. It's definitely something that we'll take a look at, but I don't think it's that easy, if you will.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOn the second one, Mark, let's talk about capital and how we plan to use it, or nothing's really changed. I'll talk about identity.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. If you look at FY 2025, first off, we returned $12.4 billion to the shareholders, so 94% of our free cash flow. As you look at it going forward, and probably important for you to hear this from me too. Number one, the first priority is just to support the growth of the business. Secondly is to support the dividend, obviously, which we have been increasing each year for some time. Another is just to really offset dilution, which would be the third priority. Fourth, I'd just say being opportunistic on how we can additionally bring value to our shareholders.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nSpecifically on identity in relation to the announced acquisition, I think that actually underscores what we've known for 10+ years, which is the importance of identity. In Zero Trust Architectures, it's a core pillar of our platform strategy. It's not an add-on. We have great leadership in this space, a lot of deep knowledge and innovation with Duo and ICE, strategic acquisitions like Duo and Ork that we already have on board.\nQ4 Duo growth was off the charts, with a lot of the new capabilities that the teams have built in for the customers as customers just today look at Zero Trust Architectures relative to their employees. We're already working on agentic identity, which is something that's really important. I think that the good news for us is we don't have to wait for an acquisition to close. We have a lot of great talent that's already working on this. Again, I think that the advantage that we're going to have here with. Identity and Agentic Security is that you're going to have to do it real-time. We are the only company that has networking and security and identity specifically within security, so we think that gives us an advantage.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. David Vogt with UBS.You may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I have two as well. Chuck, I recognize you don't buy to specific product growth, but if I think about your order intake, it's been averaging at least kind of roughly 50% on average for SP. If I use that as a proxy in fiscal 2026, it looks like AI could add about two points of revenue growth to sort of the networking business in 2026. Is that kind of the right way to frame it? The rest is really the recovery or maybe the refresh cycle in campus and strength in enterprise. Mark, my second question for you is I appreciate all the detail on the tariff impact. Appreciate that in the slide. Can you help us frame from a gross margin impact?\nIs it a 50 basis point headwind in your guide for fiscal 2026 based on where current tariff rates are and how you're thinking about it for the full year? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Let me answer the first one, and then Mark can talk about tariffs. I think you're generally in the ballpark, I think. I don't know specifically how many points, but we do expect both sides to be contributing pretty meaningfully. I think we did an analysis of our overarching growth in Q4, and I think that even if you normalized out web, it made a one-point differential, I think. So I think you're close.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems",
    "content2": "Yeah. As far as tariffs, they were really a small impact in Q4 as well as for FY 2025. Rather than sizing the dollar amount, what I really wanted to do was give you the assumptions that underpin the guide and really reinforce the components that are part of that. Certainly, China at 30% with the continuing offset by the exemption for the semiconductors and certain electronic components, Mexico at 25%, Canada at 35%. Those are only for the components that do not qualify under USMCA.\nOther countries going back to their reciprocal rates are largely offset by those exemptions for semiconductors and electronic components, plus some small tariffs related to steel, aluminum, and copper. Really just wanted to make sure you knew the exact assumptions that are into the guide.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. It's very difficult to include anything that hasn't been announced yet because it's such a dynamic environment.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, David. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nSenior Research Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nYes. Thank you. Two for me as well, and I'll ask them at the same time. Within your fiscal 2026 outlook, I was hoping you could rank order the segments that give you the most conviction in hitting the target that you laid out. Second, Chuck, you indicated that Silicon One should grow as a portion of your Nexus smart switches over time. I was hoping you could discuss whether Silicon One can represent half of your switch ASICs in the next three years. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThat's a great question. If I rank order the segments, I'd say I still remain very optimistic on SP, probably. Secondly, enterprise, and probably third, public sector. I would like to comment on public sector and give you all another data point. Our overall order growth or bookings growth of 7%. If you take out federal, the rest of the world grew at 10%. We saw good performance outside of federal. When we think about federal in fiscal year 2026, just to put it in perspective, our teams are forecasting a return to growth for federal during this fiscal year.\nNow, it's not going to be the same low. It's not going to be as high of growth as we saw a decline. We'll still be below FY 2025 levels. The good news is they're forecasting growth, so that's better. I still think I would stack rank them service provider, enterprise, and service provider, including cloud, obviously, and then enterprise and public sector. On the Nexus portfolio, I think we've got the 800Gb Nexus product that is Silicon One-based. We've got the smart switches that will be Silicon One-based. It's our intent to actually drive this as fast as we possibly can, so I think your assumption is not too far off.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Karl. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead.\n\nAdrienne Colby\n\nResearch Analyst, Citi\n\nHi. It's Adrienne Colby for Atif. Thank you for the question. The EMEA orders accelerated in the quarter, and I was hoping you could provide some color there. I also wanted to just circle back on the sovereign AI opportunities about your expectations in terms of order flow and revenue recognition there. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay. Great. If you look at EMEA, we saw 10% overall orders. Enterprise was up in the mid-teens. Public sector roughly flat. SP in the mid-teens. We saw strength in the UK, Germany, Saudi. SP was strong. Security was strong. Obviously flat in public sector. We'd like to see it a little better. I think there in Europe, I think we see opportunities. There's a couple of things going on. Number one, there's a lot of focus on sovereignty, and a lot of focus on building out their own tech stack and tech solutions.\nIn many cases, they are very keen on having on-prem solutions, like think on-prem Splunk or on-prem Webex from a sovereignty and geopolitical perspective. That's just where they're going. We think the opportunity there and the defense spending and everything else, we think that will continue to be a good opportunity for us in Europe. In that space, obviously, in Europe, Middle East, Africa, we've got the couple of sovereigns that we've announced. We have not taken any orders from them yet. We've been in the planning phases with them. They're obviously working through getting the licenses for the GPUs.\nWe sort of expect that's going to, I would lean towards looking for that, even the order flow to be sort of middle year into the second half. Then revenue would follow.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Adrian. Michelle, can we move to the final question from the analyst queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sebastien Naji with William Blair. You may go ahead.\n\nSebastien Naji\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nYeah. Thank you for squeezing me in. My first question is on the backend AI network opportunity, but maybe a little bit more longer term. There's a lot of chatter from your main silicon competitor about new chips that are going to enable Ethernet for scale-up connectivity. Within the racks, I wanted just to ask what your expectations are for Ethernet and scale-up going forward, and if we should expect new Silicon One announcements tailored to that opportunity. My second question is just on the campus network.\nYou announced the integration of Meraki and Catalyst platforms at Cisco Live, and I think the reactions have been generally pretty positive. I'm wondering if you expect this to shift behavior in hardware purchases at all. Could we see, for example, outside strength in Meraki and slower demand for Catalyst or vice versa in the next few years?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Two great questions. I think on the backend side, as I've said before, in the networking side, the two areas where the value is really derived is either in the silicon or in the software. Given that many of these folks are using a lot of their own operating systems, you have to have silicon to play in the first place. The good news is we do. When you look at this scale-up opportunity in the backend and the hyperscalers, in most cases, they're not using the clusters with the scale-up inside the cluster. They're using native connectivity within the clusters and then between clusters.\nWe think there that probably remains the predominant play. We're seeing the desire for some of these clusters in neoclouds, etc., because they're easy, but there's still a connectivity layer, obviously, between the clusters. From a scale-up perspective, we think over time that opportunity could shift to more of an Ethernet variant, which would give us, obviously, an easy way to play. We've got roadmaps that we're working on that haven't been announced yet, but I think downstream, if that occurs, we could definitely play in that space. On the Meraki Catalyst question, I actually think the opposite is actually what you would see.\nYou'd see more openness to Catalyst because of the cloud management, the simple cloud management. I think there's 35 million devices now being managed by the cloud, and so it just gives customers choice. It rationalizes the hardware down to a single platform that you can run in either mode. You can run it on-prem, or you can run it cloud-managed, and I think that's a big benefit for our customers as we go forward.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Sebastian. I'm going to now hand it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I want to thank everybody for joining today and again reiterate my thanks to our team for all their great work in Q4 and fiscal 2025, which really did set a solid foundation for fiscal year 2026. Mark, welcome. We're excited about your first earnings and what's ahead. I'm really excited about working with you.\nObviously, we see good demand for our technology. We see great things working across a great portion of our portfolio. AI is clearly a major tailwind. The web scale momentum, the emergence of the enterprise, the sovereign, and the neocloud opportunities. We've got the agentic phase coming along. I feel good about where we are. I feel good about the performance. We still have to continue to execute, and we feel really good that we've got the business positioned for success in 2026. There are certainly a lot of dynamics in a very complex world that we're all managing on a daily basis. Based on what we can control, we feel really good about it. I want to thank you for being with us once again. Sami, I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will outline our first quarter FY 2026 results, will be on Wednesday, 12 November 2025, at 1:30PM Pacific, 4:30PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, Scott Herren, our CFO, and Mark Patterson, our Chief Strategy Officer.\nCisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website. Throughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise.\nAll comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the Q4 and fiscal year 2025. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.\nWith respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Now, I'll turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for Cisco, with revenue, margins, and earnings per share all above the high end of our guidance ranges. We also generated solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue, which all support our future performance. In addition, we received AI infrastructure orders from WebSkill customers in excess of $600 million in Q3, bringing our year-to-date total to well over $1 billion, surpassing our original fiscal year 2025 AI order target a full quarter early.\nThe performance of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, underpinning our commitment to deliver consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned $3.1 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, with a total of $9.6 billion in value returned year-to-date. Our overall strong performance was a result of accelerated product innovation, and solid execution by our teams, driving sustained demand for our technologies. Total product orders grew 20% year-over-year, or 9% on an organic basis, excluding Splunk.\nDespite the uncertain macro environment, this demonstrates the valuable outcomes we are delivering for customers in the era of AI. Looking at demand in more detail by customer market, I'd also like to remind you that Q3 of fiscal year 2024 included six weeks of Splunk contribution. Enterprise product orders were up 22% year-over-year in Q3, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and APJC. Public sector orders were up 8%, with growth in all geographies, as governments around the world continue to trust Cisco as their end-to-end technology partner.\nNotably, US federal orders grew double digits in Q3 after a challenging first half. During the quarter, our AI-powered, cloud-managed Meraki for Government networking solution also achieved FedRAMP authorization from the US government. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers continue to be strong, up 32% year-over-year, driven by triple-digit growth in Webex Suite, with three of the top six Webscalers each growing orders in the triple digits. Now, some color on demand from a product perspective.\nNetworking product orders grew double digits, driven by Webscale infrastructure, enterprise routing, switching, and our industrial IoT products. Campus switching orders grew high single digits in Q3 against a tougher prior year compare, demonstrating the continued demand for our campus portfolio to enterprise customers. We also saw triple-digit sequential growth in orders for our Wi-Fi 7 portfolio in Q3. Year-to-date orders for our industrial Internet of Things portfolio, comprised of ruggedized Catalyst products, grew 35% year-over-year.\nAs strategic infrastructure and manufacturing begin to onshore to the United States, Cisco is well-positioned to help connect and protect these capital-intensive investments at scale. Our data center switching orders are up double digits year-to-date, compared with the same period last year. Cisco was recently ranked as a market leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for data center switching. This is a testament to our ability to address the full range of data center switching use cases, and our vision to simplify operations while enhancing security, which is essential for critical application deployments.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the AI infrastructure orders we have received from Webscale customers were exceptionally strong in the quarter, exceeding $600 million and bringing our year-to-date total to well over our $1 billion target for fiscal year 2025. As expected, the product mix of these orders was more than 2/3 in systems, with the remainder in optics, demonstrating the growing importance of our technology to Webscale customers for their AI training use cases.\nAI orders from enterprise customers continue to show momentum as this large, nascent market opportunity starts to unlock. Enterprises are seeking simple, seamless, scalable, and secure solutions for their AI deployments, which we are ready to deliver through our expanding partnership with NVIDIA. During the quarter, we announced our intent to create a cross-portfolio unified architecture where NVIDIA will enable Cisco Silicon One to become the only third-party silicon that is included as part of the NVIDIA Spectrum X Ethernet Networking Reference Architecture.\nCisco will also build interoperable systems combining NVIDIA Spectrum Silicon with Cisco operating system software, allowing customers to simultaneously standardize Cisco networking and NVIDIA technology in the data center across front and back-end networks. We also announced a Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA, which will embed security end-to-end, from the application to the workload to the infrastructure, using solutions like Cisco AI Defense and Hybrid Mesh Firewall, enabling enterprise customers to build and secure data centers to develop and run AI workloads.\nYesterday, we announced a new multi-phased investment program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia announced a new AI company, Humain, and we will be a strategic technology partner contributing to their AI infrastructure build-outs. This partnership aligns with Saudi's Vision 2030, contributing to the Kingdom's transformation into a diversified digital economy, and enhancing its global and regional competitiveness in the AI era.\nIn addition, we have joined the AI infrastructure partnership alongside BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners, MGX, Microsoft, NVIDIA, xAI, and energy partners GE Vernova and Nextera Energy, as it seeks to invest in secure, efficient, and scalable infrastructure to support AI workloads. We also announced an expanded collaboration with G42, the UAE-based global technology group, to advance how secure AI infrastructure and innovation can be scaled across public and private sectors.\nThese investments and partnerships highlight our market position as a global leader and preferred partner in AI networking solutions, as well as our commitment to collaborating across the industry to create a strong global ecosystem for AI. Additionally, we expect a sovereign AI cloud opportunity to ramp in the near term and that Cisco will be a core system provider for these significant AI training and inference cluster build-outs.\nAs we look at the opportunity that AI presents for Cisco, it is worth reiterating that we frame it in three distinct, but connected, pillars. First, AI training infrastructure for WebScale customers. Combinations of our Cisco 8K, Silicon One, Optics, and Optical systems are being deployed by five of the six largest WebScalers. Second, AI inference and enterprise clouds. Our accelerated innovation in hardware and software, coupled with our NVIDIA partnership, is designed to simplify and de-risk AI infrastructure deployment for the enterprise.\nThird, AI network connectivity. Customers are leveraging our technology platforms to help modernize, secure, and automate their network operations to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI agents and applications. With Agentic AI, the network is fundamentally constrained and will require ultra-fast, low-latency, energy-efficient networks, which we can deliver. Shifting to security, orders grew in high double digits in Q3.\nOur security orders included a large multi-year deal with a major financial services company for Splunk's security and observability platforms, which was driven by our combined sales force. This was a win for Splunk from an industry competitor, and is a strong proof point of our go-to-market synergy. This was also the largest deal ever for Splunk. Our recently launched security products of Secure Access, XDR, and Hypershield collectively added over 370 new customers in the quarter.\nThe majority of our new Hypershield enterprise customers are bundling it with our new N9300 Smart Switch because of our unique ability to embed security directly into the fabric of the network. Now, I'd like to comment on some highlights from our accelerating innovation pipeline. Safety and security will be the defining challenge of Agentic AI, and we recently introduced several innovations designed to help security professionals harness the power of AI while keeping security at the forefront.\nThese include Cisco XDR correlating attack telemetry across network, endpoint, and cloud, using new AI-powered solutions to empower security teams to understand complex threats in seconds. Agentic AI advancements for Cisco XDR and Splunk to simplify threat detection and response.\nA new partnership with ServiceNow, which will integrate their security operations capabilities with Cisco AI Defense, and the launch of Foundation AI, a team of leading AI and security experts focused on developing cutting-edge technology to address the fundamental security issues of the AI era with novel open-source tools, including the first reasoning model to enhance security applications.\nJust last week, we introduced Cisco's Quantum Network Entanglement Chip, a revolutionary prototype making real-world quantum networking applications possible in order to speed up the future of quantum computing. These applications will solve complex customer challenges and drive innovation across industries, from supply chain optimization to accelerating drug discovery. In addition, we are using GenAI and Agentic systems across our customer experience organization to maximize customer value, deliver great experiences, boost productivity, and create capacity.\nToday, over 60% of support cases are touched by AI-driven automation, which is driving up the proportion of complex cases we can solve within one day. In addition, low-severity cases have reduced as more customers are using our AI support assistant. Also, our AI renewals agent has enabled us to increase the capacity of our renewals specialist.\nAs you can see, we are driving an enormous amount of innovation, and I look forward to showcasing even more new customer-centric solutions at Cisco Live next month. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd also like to share some important organizational announcements. After careful consideration, Scott has made the decision to retire at the end of fiscal year 2025. As many of you know, Scott joined us in 2020 during a period of great uncertainty around the world, and he has been instrumental in driving our transition towards more software and recurring revenue.\nThis has driven greater predictability for our business and increased shareholder value, and I want to thank Scott for all that he has done for Cisco. I am grateful for his partnership as we've managed through many unprecedented situations together. I'm happy to share that beginning day one fiscal year 2026, Mark Patterson, our current Chief Strategy Officer, will serve as Cisco's new Chief Financial Officer. In Mark's nearly 25 years at Cisco, he's held leadership roles in finance, strategy, and operations.\nHe also spent over a decade in sales, working in roles that spanned every customer segment and geography. Most recently, leading our corporate strategy, development, and incubation organization, Mark's focus has been on connecting our longer-term strategy and investments with our immediate and urgent growth opportunities. The breadth of his experience, along with his deep knowledge of Cisco and our customers, partners, and investor community, uniquely positioned him to help accelerate Cisco's growth in this new role. I'm also excited to announce the promotion of Jeetu Patel to President and Chief Product Officer.\nUnder Jeetu's leadership over the past nine months, he has unified our product vision and strategy, and vastly accelerated our innovation pipeline, focusing on delivering even greater value for our customers and our partners. We also announced the appointment of Kevin Weil, Chief Product Officer of OpenAI, to Cisco's board of directors yesterday. These announcements further our confidence in Cisco's long-term success and durability in the era of AI. To summarize the quarter, we are seeing clear demand for our technology across our customer markets.\nOur innovation pipeline continues to accelerate as we fuse security deep into our networking products, and our strong performance is fueling our capital allocation model, returning significant value to our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Scott for more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance ranges, coupled with solid margins and operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was $14.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.8 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.96. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.4 billion, up 15%, and services revenue was $3.8 billion, up 3%. Networking was up 8%, with growth across most of the portfolio, led by double-digit growth in switching and enterprise routing, partially offset by a decline in servers.\nSecurity was up 54%, primarily driven by growth in our offerings from Splunk and SASE. Collaboration was up 4%, driven by growth in devices, Webex Suite, and our CPaaS offerings, and observability was up 24%. Looking at our recurring metrics, total ARR ended the quarter at $30.6 billion, an increase of 5%, with product ARR growth of 8%. Total subscription revenue increased 15% to $7.9 billion, and represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 25% at $5.6 billion, with software subscription revenue up 26%.\nTotal RPO was $41.7 billion, up 7%. Product RPO grew 10%, and total short-term RPO was $21.1 billion, up 5%. Q3 product orders were up 20% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 9% year-over-year. Looking at product orders across our geographic segments, the Americas was up 27%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was up 21%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 32%, enterprise was up 22%, and public sector was up 8%.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.6%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 67.6%, up 70 basis points, driven by productivity improvements and Splunk, partially offset by pricing. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 71.3%, down 30 basis points. The impact of tariffs on our gross margin was favorable to what was estimated in the guidance we provided last quarter.\nWe continue our focus on profitability and financial discipline, with non-GAAP operating margin at 34.5%, above the high end of our guidance range. We recorded a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which was favorable by 1.5 percentage points compared to what was assumed in our guidance, primarily due to an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and one-time benefits.\nShifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $15.6 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by revenue and earnings growth. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and $1.5 billion of share repurchases, with $15.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.\nWe continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we closed the acquisition of SnapAttack, which adds capability to Splunk in helping organizations power the security operations center of the future. To summarize, we had another solid quarter with top and bottom-line performance exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins.\nWe remain focused on making strategic investments in innovation across our business to best capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead, all underpinned by disciplined spend management. It's this powerful combination that continues to fuel our strong cash flow generation, as well as our ability to return significant value to our shareholders. Turning to guidance, while we've seen some progress on tariffs, there continues to be uncertainty. Our guide assumes current tariffs and exemptions remain in place through the quarter.\nThese include the following: China at 30%, partially offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components, and Mexico and Canada at 25% for the components and products that are not eligible for the current USMCA exemptions. Other countries at a base rate of 10% until the end of the 90-day pause on 9 July 2024, then reverting to country-specific reciprocal tariffs, largely offset by an exemption for semiconductors and certain electronic components.\nFinally, a small impact from tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliatory tariffs. We'll continue to leverage our world-class supply chain team to help mitigate the impact, where appropriate, through the flexibility and agility we have built into our operations over the last few years. The size and scale of our supply chain provides us some unique advantages as we support our customers globally. For fiscal Q4, our guidance is we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.5 to 14.7 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to $0.98, and we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For the full year fiscal 2025, our guidance is we expect revenue to be in the range of $56.5 billion to $56.7 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.77 to $3.79. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nCybersecurity and Network and Equipment Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe the two questions for me. Just one, what are you seeing in terms of customer buying behavior right now, given the uncertainty with some of the tariffs that you laid out, and whether you saw any pull forward potentially in April? Maybe as a second question, any commentary around public sector and federal around the same questions? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Meta, thank you. I'll give you some commentary, and then I'm going to ask Scott to give you some data points on this pull ahead issue. I'd say on the customer behavior perspective, first of all, we haven't seen any meaningful change in their purchasing. We haven't seen any customers really fundamentally slowing down. They're still committed to the technology transition.\nI think the AI transition is just so important that they're going to continue to spin until they just absolutely have to stop. I think that as of right now, they're still comfortable. As it relates to pull forwards, look, I'm sure there was an order here or there from a customer who decided to pull something forward because they were concerned about tariffs. We looked at a ton of data points to see if we saw any signs of broad-based pull ahead business, and we did not. I'm going to ask Scott real quick to share some of those data points, then I'll answer public sector.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks, Chuck. I should remind you too, Meta, that we didn't motivate a lot of pull ahead by talking about price increases.\nIf you remember, the way we talked about the impact of tariffs was we had a number of levers. We have a great world-class supply chain team. Once the tariff scenario stabilizes, there are steps that we can take to mitigate it, as you've seen us do with the China tariffs from the first Trump administration. Only after that would we consider pricing. We didn't build a strong motivation.\nWe looked at, after speaking to our channel partners, who also didn't see any buy ahead or delay behavior, by the way, and our own sales team, we looked at channel inventory, which you would think would go up. It did not. It actually was down. We work closely with the web scalers. We understand not just what they have on order, but what they have on hand.\nActually, web scaler inventory on hand went down during the quarter. We looked at Meraki activations. We know when a serial number X leaves the factory floor and when it gets activated. When we had built up some inventory at our customers, you recall that period of time between shipment and activation extended. It stayed right where it was, which is back in line with where it was pre-pandemic, so there's no indication there.\nOf course, we looked at linearity, in particular to see if we saw a spike in the third month, which, if you recall, the reciprocal tariffs were announced on 2 April. If there was some buy ahead activity, we would have seen a heavier month three. We did not see that. We saw the exact same linearity that we had seen historically there. We looked at our pipeline for pull aheads or push-outs. Nothing out of the ordinary there.\nI'd say the last metric is we look at when a customer orders today but requests a future ship date. There's always a little bit of that that happens, but we looked to see was there a pattern of a lot of orders that came in with a future ship date, and there was nothing out of the ordinary either. We really don't see any signs of any notable pull ahead or, for that matter, push-out.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nMeta, let me cover the public sector. I know we put this in the corresponding slides, I think, but global public sector was up 8%. If you just look at the organic growth, it was up 3% globally. In the US, we saw strength in federal, ironically. We saw double-digit order growth in US federal this quarter. Candidly, that was with our biggest deal slipping out, so that was positive. I would say there still continues to be stress on the civilian side, obviously, with agencies that have been shut down, with employees who are worried about their jobs.\nThere's a lot of just human capital concern on the civilian side, but it's also important to remember that that's about a quarter of our federal business. 75% of it is intelligence and Department of Defense. Overall, we were pleased with public sector during the quarter.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Meta. Michelle, can we go to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHi. This year, Meta is growing CapEx by 70%, and you see very strong growth across the board. The question is, I know you're only now ramping networking, but the question is whether 2025 you think is a peak year, meaning CapEx will likely slow down, materially slow down. What happens to Cisco in an environment where cloud CapEx is slowing down? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nHey, Tal, thank you. First of all, I don't know that I would suggest that cloud CapEx, particularly on a global basis, as you see the announcements that were made in the Middle East this week, we're seeing sovereign cloud strategies being built around the world. I think that on a global basis, I don't think that will be the case. In talking to these customers, I don't anticipate that they have a huge demand for slowing down.\nI think that you may see a different balance between their investments on capital to serve enterprise customers leveraging these models through inference and other things. I don't anticipate it's going to be that 2025 is going to be a peak year. I think this has many years to run.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nTal, just to remind you, on the tail end of building out all the public cloud infrastructure for training, there's a significantly larger opportunity in enterprise AI, right, as they build out the capability to do inferencing inside their own data centers. I think, in aggregate, the AI opportunity has several years to run at this point.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Tal. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAaron Rakers with Wells Fargo, you may go ahead.\nYeah, thanks, Sami, and congrats on the quarter, and Scott on the future retirement. I guess I'll ask my kind of two quick questions in conjunction here. I want to, I think, check in the prepared comments you referenced a large sovereign deployment opportunity that is coming here soon. The first question on that is, is that currently in your order book, the $600 million you saw this last quarter?\nIf not, how do you think about the size of those opportunities? The quick follow-on is, I think this last quarter you launched or you started shipping your 51.2T, I think it's the G200 silicon. Can you just give us an update of what you're seeing in the data center switching side and if that really becomes a catalyst here as we look out over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks, Aaron. I think you're referencing the Humain announcement that we made yesterday or that the Saudis made early this week. They announced the creation of this company. We've been working with them on this for months. The short answer is there's absolutely no orders in the $600 million from them. They are just getting started. We've got a team of people returning to the Middle East next week to spend more time with them.\nI think it's important to note on Humain, the CEO there is an individual named Tariq Amin. Just to give you some background on Tariq, he was the CTO at Reliance Jio when we built that network with them over the course of several years. He was also CEO of Rakuten when we built with him the OpenRAN mobile network in Japan. We've been engaged with Tariq since he actually moved into Saudi Arabia. He is a good friend, an old friend. We've been doing large-scale projects with him for a dozen years now.\nHe knows us, we know him well, and we're looking forward to that opportunity. I think that's not included in any of our forecasts from our sales teams or anything at this point. On the second point, the G200 chip, I would say it is at the heart of any of these systems orders. I made comment that of the $600+ million, 2/3 of it was systems.\nThose systems would be based on the G200. I would tell you that right now, those customers are telling us that if we could get more capacity out, they would buy more. It's actually doing well right now. We've got a number of other chips that are in various stages of the process for next-generation platforms that we're also looking forward to.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sonic Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nJoe Curtis\n\nFraud Specialist, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good afternoon. This is Joe Curtis on for Sonic. Also wanted to follow up on the Middle East announcements. Maybe two-parter here is just, can you elaborate on how Cisco is looking to participate here, particularly as it relates to the portfolio? I know it's early days, but any early insights that you can share into the timing and magnitude of these opportunities for the company as kind of investors are looking to embed it potentially into the model? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYou want to go ahead and ask your follow-up, Joe, and we'll just get them both?\n\nJoe Curtis\n\nFraud Specialist, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, yeah, sure. The follow-up's actually just more on the enterprise vertical, particularly campus. Obviously, orders are coming in good on the enterprise vertical, but just curious if you could flesh out what are you hearing from customers on this front, and the momentum that you're seeing in kind of the order backlog here and how you're thinking about the opportunity around the recovery relative to when we last spoke 90 days ago.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay. On the Middle East front, I will just tell you that Tariq made a comment to me that they're behind and they're going to catch up. I think they're going to spend a lot of money, and I think they're going to spend it as quickly as they possibly can. It's hundreds of billions of dollars at the end of the day that they will be spending. If you go to their website and scroll down, they list their initial strategic partners, so you can see. Our discussions with them have been around the networking, compute, security, and observability.\nThat represents a pretty good opportunity for us. I think they'll be as big as any of the major web scalers in the United States is how I would think about it. On the enterprise campus front, yeah, we saw strong orders in campus switching. We saw the triple-digit sequential growth in orders for Wi-Fi 7. We saw really strong growth in our enterprise routing portfolio this quarter. We still see customers investing heavily in modernizing their infrastructure.\nThe general belief and feedback that we're getting from these customers is, as they get ready to roll out Agentic AI in particular, the network is absolutely going to be key because of the real-time nature of this communication. They all want to make sure that while they may not know exactly what those applications are going to look like right now, they absolutely know they're going to need the most modern networks they can have. I think that's what's driving it right now.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Joe. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nPresident and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question, and congratulations, Scott, on the upcoming retirement. Really appreciate all your time and help throughout the years. As it relates to my two questions, first, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the networking orders strength in the quarter. How much of that was the broad recovery and things like campus?\nHow much did the product cycle of Wi-Fi 7 contribute, and could we expect that to continue over the next 12 to 18 months here or so? Second, just a housekeeping question. I was wondering if you could just share the organic revenue growth rates for the company and the segment Splunk if you have that offhand. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay. I think on the networking order strength, I think it was across the board. As I was saying earlier, I think we saw it in the enterprise switching space. We saw it in, we saw growth in data center switching. We saw strong growth in enterprise routing. We saw that triple-digit sequential growth in Wi-Fi 7. I do think, to your point, it's a 12 to 18-month cycle. I think once customers begin this, I mean, it's a standard upgrade cycle that we've seen historically.\nI think the way to think about it is we've talked about the fact that there's a window, and there's sort of a time frame where we typically deliver refresh products, whether it's the Wi-Fi portfolio or the campus switching portfolio. When that begins as well, that'll also enhance that ongoing opportunity, I think, as we look to the future. Scott, you want to talk a little bit of organic rev?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Michael, thanks for the comments and for the question. First of all, I should say Splunk is performing in line with, or actually slightly ahead of, our expectations on both revenue and profitability. It's consistent with what we told you last quarter. The integration has gone really well. The people side of integration is pretty much complete at this point across all functions.\nThe product integration continues to go along well. This is the quarter that we actually lapped the acquisition during Q3. At this point, it's part of the run rate. I don't really plan on breaking out organic versus inorganic from this point forward. It gets harder and harder given the level of integration we've done across the board to split that out. Not really planning on giving that data point given that it's just part of our overall run rate at this point.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Michael. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nMatthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Niknam\n\nSenior Investment Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thanks so much for taking this question. Scott, thank you again for all your help over these last couple of years. My question's on web scale. Obviously, you continue to see very impressive growth here. Maybe, Chuck, if you can talk to what's driving some of the sustained success, the pace of transition away from InfiniBand towards Ethernet, and maybe some of the bigger differentiators that are helping you win incremental share across these hyperscalers. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks, Matthew. Look, I think it's been the intent of these customers from day one to move away from InfiniBand. The gating factor was how soon did they feel good about the technology. They feel very good about the technology and how it's enabling them to run these training models over native Ethernet or some enhanced Ethernet that we are delivering.\nI think that we've talked over the last few years about their desire to have silicon diversity, which we think was one of the key reasons that we got in originally. Now we're delivering high-quality products in the time frame they need them. If you look at what they're looking for in these products from their partners, there's really sort of you have a system that has software, has silicon, and then other components. The real high-value pieces of this are the operating system and the silicon.\nAs many of them are transitioning hard into running their own proprietary operating systems on these platforms, it's imperative that you have silicon if you want to be competitive long-term in this space. We're very fortunate that we made the acquisition in 2016. We have a great team that's been developing Silicon One.\nThey're very close to these customers. They work with them every day. I think the silicon is the key differentiator that's really, I mean, we're delivering high-quality systems and everything else that they want: the services, the experience, the supply chain, all those things that matter deeply. At the end of the day, if we didn't have the silicon, it would probably make it virtually impossible for us to be successful long-term here.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Matthew. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nAmit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. Starting off, Chuck, your AI orders at a billion dollars, it came in, I think, a quarter ahead of what you folks had expected. It looks like you're seeing some continued momentum as you go forward with sovereign and enterprise that you talked about. I'm just wondering, how should we think about the growth rates as we move forward on AI orders or AI revenues?\nIt would be helpful to just kind of frame that out a little bit in terms of the forward growth rates. If I could just follow up for Scott, your July quarter guide, Scott, if I'm not mistaken, implies revenues are up 3% to 4% sequentially, but operating margins are down 50 basis points. Maybe just flesh out why the margins are coming down in July while revenues are going up. Best of luck on your retirement as well. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Amit. On the AI orders, how do you think about the growth? I would say just one thing to remember is that these are big customers, and these orders are non-linear in nature. We'll see how it goes. I mean, last quarter, we did 350 or something like that. This quarter, we exceeded 600. As I said earlier, if we could increase capacity, they would take more.\nI think if we're able to execute and increase capacity, we should be able to continue to see this ramp as long as we're delivering and executing, which is one thing I've said all along is we have to execute because if we miss with these customers, then we sit on the sidelines for a while. The teams are working really hard. I think that's how I'd think about it. It's non-linear orders. If we can continue to increase the capacity, then we'll continue to see that business improve. Scott, you want to talk about July?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure. Yeah. You're doing the math right. Amit, first of all, thanks for what you said. You're doing the math right on margins. The biggest difference you can see, it's actually in the gross margin line, and that falls through to the op margin line. That's really a full quarter of, and I laid out the assumptions for you in the opening commentary on tariffs. It's a full quarter of the tariffs being in effect.\nWe've reflected the full cost without mitigation, and that's the big driver that we see sequentially going from Q3 to Q4. Still feel good about putting up the midpoint of the guide at 11% EPS growth.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Amit. Michelle, we can move to the next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you very much for taking the question. I'll ask both upfront. The first one is, Chuck, I think last quarter you had sort of alluded to an upcoming campus refresh, and I would think Cisco's sort of due. What I'd like some help with is understanding the maybe historic perspective of when you've had these refreshes, how to think about that.\nBecause when I reflect on the last one, 2017, 2018, that occurred when you were shifting customers to subscription. I feel like that's a tough metric to use to understand the potential. The follow-up may be a bit simpler, which is how do we think about the impact of tariffs? Understanding they're changing every day. Given everything we know, after 9 July, what would be the effect of tariffs based on the 9 July end of the pause? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Simon, I think your point relative to the 2017 kickoff of the campus refreshes is a very valid one. It's hard to say. We've also seen some strength over the last 12 months in the enterprise campus business. Here's what I would tell you, though, as we look to really drive this over the next 12 to 24 months. I think that what's most important to our customers right now is that we embed security deep into the network.\nWhat you're going to see is a focus on enabling Agentic AI and enabling security and security services in the network so that our customers can do this in line, which is going to be necessary for us to solve the AI problem. I'll tell you, I had a discussion with a CISO of a Fortune 100 company a couple of weeks ago. G2 and I were together.\nWe started talking about security, and she stopped us and said, Listen, if you can't paint a picture for me, define an architecture for me, multi-year architecture that has me removing every physical firewall from my infrastructure, then I don't want to talk to you. Because if it's not embedded in the traffic flows, it's never going to happen. It's not going to work.\nWhat I would tell you on this is just envision that we're going to deploy security everywhere out through the network infrastructure. That plus AI, I think, will give customers reasons to really look at these platforms.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah Simon, on your second question on the impact of tariffs after 9 July, I mentioned in the opening commentary that we've built into our forecast that underpins the guide for Q4 an expectation that on 9 July, that pause ends, and we go back to the reciprocal tariffs that were announced on 2 April with the two exemptions, the USMCA exemption still in place, and the semiconductor and certain electronic component exemption still in place.\nWe've reflected that in the guide for Q4. I think it's a little bit hard right now to predict what is going to happen on 9 July and what agreements get put in place between now and then. Just wanted to protect the downside in the guide.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Simon. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir. Hey, guys.\n\nJames Fish\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nNice quarter. Scott, congrats on your upcoming retirement here. Look, I don't want to rain on the parade here, but if I look at networking here, it returned to growth, but it was also against a very easy compare and even still down versus a couple of years ago. If AI really isn't substitutionary of existing non-AI networking real estate with some of these web scales and enterprises growing, the rates are calling out, why isn't this sort of growing faster than even the 8% on the comp here?\nJust following up on Simon's question before, as my follow-up, can we just get an update as to the exposure between data center versus campus within networking and how we should think about the price report kind of playing out here as we're seven, eight years now down the road? Thanks, guys.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOn the first one, I think the short answer is that most of this AI infrastructure has not begun to flow through revenue yet. Scott, I don't know if you want to comment.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, that's right. We said all along that we thought when we put the billion-dollar target out for the year, that was a sales target, not a revenue target. We said we thought that would begin to convert to revenue in the second half of the year. We saw that, again, the first piece of that in Q3, and we expect to see a bit of it again in Q4.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I think on the data center versus campus, I mean, clearly the data center with a higher speed, you're going to see a higher per port cost, but you're going to see much higher volumes in the campus. I think they sort of normalize each other out over time\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. David Vogt with UBS.\n\n[Analyst] (UBS)\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. This is Andrew for David. I wanted to ask a question about the texture of the $600 million of AI orders. You mentioned that they tend to be non-linear. They're very large customers, and I'm wondering if you're starting to see bigger orders as a large component of that $600 million with the customers where you're having the most success, or are you really seeing sort of a diffuse kind of large, growing orders across a number of customers that you mentioned you had three growing triple digits?\nThe follow-up question I wanted to ask is just, I'm not sure if I missed it, but could you give an estimate of roughly what you think the impact of tariffs are in your guidance for Q4 for gross margin? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Andrew, I think you nailed it. You almost answered the question for us. I mean, we have three of the six that grew triple digits, so I think it's fairly balanced. I will tell you that when I would look at these customers, we're seeing acceleration across all of them. It's all positive, but in this case, we had three that were just super high growers. Next quarter, maybe a different three. We'll see. It's pretty balanced.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nOn your question on the tariff impact in the guide, what I wanted to do is make sure you understood the assumptions that were built into it. We walked through those: China at 30%, Mexico and Canada where it's not eligible for the USMCA exemption at 25%, 10% everywhere else until 9 July, and then reverting back to the reciprocal tariffs, and then a small impact on us for the tariffs on steel and aluminum retaliatory.\nThat's all built into the guide. I haven't broken out and quantified the dollar value that goes with that. I'm a little reluctant to because the puck keeps moving on this. What I wanted you to understand is that everything that we know today, the impact of those has been built into the guide for Q4.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Andrew. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nYes, thank you. I have two, and I'll just ask them at the same time as well, please. The extended partnership with NVIDIA is an endorsement of your Silicon One family and certainly underscores your opportunity as enterprises deploy AI compute. I was hoping you could quantify your AI orders for enterprise that are incremental to the billion of AI order target you have for cloud.\nSecond, when might Silicon One offer co-packaged optic solutions as you seek to broaden your data center switch offering? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks, Karl. First of all, I'd say the NVIDIA partnership, we've had a couple of phases of the announcements. A lot of the solutions that we're going to deliver to the enterprise are still to be delivered. Most of them start rolling out like 60 days from now, and they'll be flowing after that.\nFirst thing I want to just clarify is we haven't seen a lot of upside yet in the enterprise from that. I would say the enterprise AI orders, it's a little more difficult for us to flag these, but we have been trying to do so so that we have a baseline. What I will tell you is that we're definitely seeing acceleration. It's in the hundreds of millions of dollars, not in the billions yet that we're seeing.\nAgain, there's a lot of dependence on the Salesforce flagging these things properly when you get into that scale with the number of enterprise customers that we have. On the Silicon One CPO question, I think it's important to remember that we demonstrated CPO in 2023. At the time there wasn't a significant amount of customer demand for it for lots of reasons. We have a team of people that are working on it.\nWe will embrace it. I think that it's going to be driven by customer desire, and I think that's going to be driven by a combination of power benefit as well as speed requirements. As soon as customers are asking for it, we'll be first in market ready to deliver it.\n\nSami Badri",
    "content2": "VP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Karl. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Atef Malik with Citi, you may go ahead.\n\nAdrienne Colby\n\nAssistant VP and Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, it's Adrienne Colbyne Colby for Atef. Thank you for taking the question. It's been a while since you talked about your AI pipeline versus your AI orders. I was hoping you could update us on what that part of the funnel is looking like. Secondly, I was hoping with the departure of Gary Steele, if you could update us on the search there for a new head of go-to-market.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Correct me if I'm wrong, Scott, but we don't give out pipeline for AI at this point. We did that a long time ago. It was the billion-dollar target, and the pipeline stuff was really to give you all more confidence that we were serious in this space. I think the results have now said that these customers are taking us seriously.\nWe won't be doing all that on an ongoing basis. Yeah, we named a new head of go-to-market, Oliver Tusek, who was most recently running our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. Before that, he was running our global partner organization. Before he came to Cisco, he was a CEO of a partner. He has a really deep understanding of our go-to-market model. We announced him a week ago. Yeah, a week ago. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Adrienne. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sebastian Naji with William Blair. You may go ahead.\n\nSebastian Naji\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your networking business, and in particular your hyperscaler customers, and in particular the usage of White Box. Given that Cisco can provide that broad range of offerings from the chip to White Box to the full system, can you maybe just comment on whether you see White Box eating up a bigger part of the spending pie? Is it AI that's driving that share shift or something else that's happening?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nWell, what I would say is that I don't think we've seen a meaningful shift between what they buy from us versus when they buy White Boxes. To your point, when they want to buy White Boxes, we can work with them to actually integrate our silicon and actually manage the process for them and help deliver that product. We see the predominance is still buying systems.\nI think it's just up to every hyperscaler, as each has a different set of kind of issues that lead them to the answer. In some cases, some of them have had an answer two years ago that now has changed, and they're doing it a different way. I'm not sure there's a real clean answer across the customer base.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Just a quick reminder, Sebastian, we said this earlier, but of the more than $600 million in orders that we took during Q3, 2/3 of those were systems as opposed to optics and optical. We are seeing the shift to systems that we had predicted in the Q2 call.\n\nSami Badri\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations and Market Insight, Cisco\n\nThank you, Sebastian. I'm now going to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Let me just thank all of you again for joining and reiterate how pleased I am with our progress, and how proud I am of what our teams have done. I'd also like to once again thank Scott. He's been a great partner for me for the last five years, helping drive the transition and, as I said earlier, dealing with some pretty complex situations over the years. I'm excited to have Mark step into the role. Mark and I have worked closely together for 18 years. He has a great set of experiences here at Cisco and will bring a lot into the role.\n\nMark Patterson\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nAs we look ahead, I think the AI opportunity for us, we believe, is a strong one. We think we're well-positioned. We believe that because from a technology and a portfolio perspective, we play across the full stack. We have networking, security, and silicon, which I think are all very important. We have secure AI solutions that we're delivering into the marketplace. We also have the partnerships and the investments. We have the NVIDIA partnership, which is delivering critical solutions for our customers.\nThis week, we announced the Humain partnership, the AIP investments, the G42 partnership, and there are more to come. I think the other thing we have is we have global presence. We have customer trust. We have the ability to understand both the cloud customers, as well as the enterprise customers, and the public sector customers. When these sovereign clouds are being discussed, we have a unique perspective across all of those segments.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. Cisco's Earnings Press Release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we'll also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website.\nThroughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-on-year basis. Please note that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2025.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings, particularly our most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Now, I'll turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Sami. Thank you all for joining us today. We saw strong results in Q2 with revenue, margins, and earnings per share all coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our positive top-line performance was supported by strong demand for our technology, generating double-digit growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue, which accounted for 56% of our total revenue in the quarter.\nImportantly, our AI infrastructure orders with web scalers in Q2 surpassed $350 million, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $700 million, and we are on track to exceed $1 billion of AI infrastructure orders in fiscal year 2025. In Q2, we returned $2.8 billion in value to our shareholders, totaling $6.4 billion year-to-date.\nToday, we also announced an increase to Cisco's dividend, and our board authorized an additional $15 billion in share repurchases, all demonstrating our commitment to returning value to shareholders through consistent capital returns. Now, I'll provide some insight into the positive demand environment we saw during the quarter. New product orders grew 29%, up 11% organically when excluding Splunk, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating order growth.\nThis is a testament to the power of our portfolio, and the value we bring to our customers. Enterprise product orders were up 27%, with double-digit growth across all geographic segments. We continue to see very strong momentum in service provider and cloud, with product orders up 75%, driven by triple-digit growth in web scale. Three of the top six web scalers each grew orders in the triple digits, and two of the six each grew more than 50%.\nThis shows our increasing relevance to this high-growth customer market as they scale their infrastructure for AI. Within SP and cloud, orders from telco customers grew more than 20%, with continued demand indicated as they reinvest in their core networks to be ready for AI connectivity. Public sector orders were up 13%, with growth in all geographies as governments around the world turn to Cisco as their trusted end-to-end partner, particularly as they develop and deploy sovereign AI clouds to digitally transform government services.\nNow, some color on demand from a product perspective. Networking product orders grew double digits, driven by switching, enterprise routing, web scale infrastructure, and industrial networking applications in our IoT products. Campus switching orders were up double digits, and we expect our campus switching portfolio, as well as our Wi-Fi 7 access points, to gain traction with increasing return-to-office policies.\nWe also continue to see robust order growth for data center switching, this being our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We expect this to continue as our 800-gig Nexus switches, based on our 51.2 terabit Silicon One chip, become available in April for AI cloud build-outs. We're also starting to see growth in AI orders from enterprise customers as this large market opportunity starts to open up, and enterprises seek seamless installation and security partners for production environments that leverage their proprietary data.\nIn Q2, we signed several AI system deals where customers bought our integrated systems, including Nexus, UCS, and additional solutions to power the AI applications they are deploying today. Additionally, our recently launched Cisco AI Pod product, consisting of Cisco hardware and software, is beginning to gain early traction, making it easier for partners to sell, and customers to deploy AI infrastructure.\nI also want to call out the strong performance of our industrial Internet of Things product solutions, comprised of our ruggedized Catalyst products, which we sell to industrial and manufacturing customers. In the first half of fiscal year 2025, orders grew more than 40%, and in Q2, we saw growth of more than 50%, signaling an acceleration as customers prepare for the deployment of AI-powered robotics and industrial security.\nAs the United States takes steps to onshore strategic infrastructure, such as semiconductor fabrication plants, manufacturing, and scaled AI power sources, we have the market-leading secure networking portfolio to help connect and protect these capital-intensive investments at scale. Our security orders more than doubled again this quarter, driven by the advanced data management, analytics, and threat detection capabilities of Splunk, and by demand for key products like our refreshed firewall.\nIn just 12 months, both Cisco Secure Access and XDR have gained more than 1,000 customers combined, and approximately 1 million enterprise users each. Even before it's in full production, Hypershield is also seeing solid momentum. In Q2, we booked major platform deals with two Fortune 100 enterprise customers who are leveraging Hypershield to deploy security into the network in a fundamentally new way. A third platform deal involving multiple Cisco products and services was spearheaded by Splunk, which shows the success of our joint and cross-selling motions.\nSince Splunk became a part of Cisco almost 11 months ago, we continue to integrate our businesses and fuel synergies without disrupting momentum. During the quarter, we also integrated Talos into Splunk's newly released enterprise security 8.0 solution, and AppDynamics into Splunk's on-prem log observer. I'd also like to highlight some key innovation we launched in the quarter.\nContinuing on the Splunk side, we rolled out Splunk on Azure, Splunk Federated Analytics, and AI Assistant for Splunk observability. In a major launch last month, we unveiled AI Defense, our latest security breakthrough, purpose-built for enterprises to develop, deploy, and secure AI applications with confidence.\nAI Defense leverages our unmatched network visibility to safeguard against the misuse of AI tools, data leakage, and increasingly sophisticated threats. By delivering security at the network level in a way only Cisco can, we are offering enterprises consistent and reliable protection for their AI applications. The response to AI Defense has been phenomenal from our early access customers, with general availability in March.\nThe launch of AI Defense coincided with our AI Summit, where we brought together several technology luminaries, AI pioneers, and leaders from close to half of the Fortune 100 to discuss the opportunities and challenges of AI, and explore crucial topics such as policy and ethics, advancements in silicon, and breakthroughs in data science, with well over 60,000 online registrants.\nAI security is top of mind for our customers, especially in light of the emergence of new AI models. These have reinforced that the battle for AI leadership will be on a global playing field, with competition fueling innovation, speed to adoption, and scale, all of which further accelerate the demand for and adoption of AI network infrastructure, data capacity investments, and best-in-class AI security, and all are tailwinds for Cisco.\nAt Cisco Live EMEA this week, we launched our first data center smart switch with embedded programmable DPUs built on Silicon One. The smart switch combines both networking and data processing in a single high-capacity, multifunctional device to simplify data centers and make them more efficient to meet the performance demands of AI. We also introduced Agile Services Networking, a new Silicon One-based architecture, which incorporates optics, assurance, and automation for service providers as they evolve their infrastructure to offer new services and deliver enhanced connectivity to their end customers.\nOverall, Cisco's innovation engine has never been more powerful. In line with that, it is worth reiterating that we frame the Cisco AI opportunity in three distinct but connected pillars. First, AI training infrastructure for web scale customers.\nCombinations of our Cisco 8000, Silicon One, optics, and optical systems are being deployed by five of the largest web scalers in their back-end training networks. Second, AI inference and enterprise clouds. Our Nexus switches, NVIDIA-based AI servers, AI pods, HyperFabric, and AI Defense software are designed to simplify and de-risk AI infrastructure deployment, and bring the power of open hyperscale AI networking to the enterprise. Third, AI network connectivity. Customers are leveraging our technology platforms across switching, routing, security, and observability to modernize, secure, and automate their network operations to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI applications.\nThis, combined with mature back-end models, will lead to increased capacity requirements from both private and public front-end cloud networks. We also continue to fuse AI into many of our products, with AI assistance in production across our security and collaboration platforms, and developing agentic capabilities across the portfolio.\nIn addition, we are using advanced AI across customer experience to maximize customer value and boost productivity. In Q2, we launched the Renewals Agent, an agentic AI-driven solution co-developed with Mistral that streamlines renewal proposals. We launched a new assistant to help customers digitize and de-risk network change management, and we added predictive analysis, as well as proactive technical support, to our network security products to greatly reduce time to resolution.\nThese are important milestones as we build towards agentic AI-led customer experience. Before I close, I want to touch on an announcement we made earlier today. Gary Steele, our president of go-to-market and former CEO of Splunk, will be departing Cisco at the end of the quarter for an external CEO opportunity. Gary's leadership has been instrumental in ensuring a successful integration of Splunk into Cisco.\nAs we've said, the Splunk integration has gone extremely well, with revenue in line with our expectations, and profitability well ahead of expectations. Gary has really done a terrific job. In addition, during his time as our president of go-to-market, he also helped evolve our sales and go-to-market motions to drive growth and align with the needs of our customers and partners today and for the future. I want to thank Gary for his partnership, leadership, and unwavering commitment since we announced our intent to acquire Splunk 18 months ago.\nAs a result of this, we are immediately launching an internal and external search for a new go-to-market leader, and Gary will stay with Cisco through the end of Q3 to ensure a smooth transition. Now, let me summarize the quarter. There is clear demand for Cisco's technologies, which has accelerated, as evidenced by our strong results.\nOur pipeline of product innovation is accelerating as we build security deep into our networking products. The strength of our performance enabled our capital allocation model to return significant value to our shareholders. Lastly, we believe our strong execution and momentum position us well as we enter the second half of fiscal year 2025. Scott, over to you for more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered a strong quarter with revenue and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance ranges, coupled with solid margins and operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was $14 billion, up 9% year over year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.8 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.94. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 11%, and service revenue was $3.8 billion, up 6%.\nNetworking was down 3%, with growth in wireless and switching offset by a decline in servers. It's important to note that our Q2 2024 included the last portion of elevated backlog shipments. Security was up 117%, primarily driven by growth in our offerings from Splunk, SASE, and network security. Excluding Splunk, security grew 4%. Collaboration was up 1%, driven by growth in contact center, CPaaS offerings, and collaboration devices, partially offset by a decline in our on-prem WebEx Suite offerings. Observability was up 47%.\nExcluding Splunk, observability grew 3% for the quarter. Looking at our recurring metrics, total ARR ended the quarter at $30.1 billion, an increase of 22%, with product ARR growth of 41%. Total subscription revenue increased 23% to $7.9 billion and now represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 33% at $5.5 billion, with software subscription revenue up 39%.\nTotal RPO was $41.3 billion, up 16%. Product RPO grew 25%, and total short-term RPO was up 17% to $21 billion. Q2 product orders were up 29% year over year. Excluding Splunk, organic product orders were up 11% year over year. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments, Americas was up 30%, EMEA was up 24%, and APJC was up 35%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 75%, enterprise was up 27%, and public sector was up 13%.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.7%, up 200 basis points year over year, coming in line with our guidance range. Product gross margin was 67.7%, up 250 basis points, driven by Splunk and productivity improvements, partially offset by pricing. Services gross margin was 71.6%, up 110 basis points.\nWe continued our focus on profitability and financial discipline, with non-GAAP operating margin above the high end of our guidance range at 34.7%. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $16.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $2.2 billion, up 177%, primarily driven by higher tax payments in the prior year. From a CAP allocation perspective, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and $1.2 billion of share repurchases.\nGiven the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our board has authorized an additional $15 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total outstanding authorization to approximately $17 billion. We're also raising our dividend by one penny to $0.41 per quarter, which represents our 14th consecutive annual increase.\nWe continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q2, we closed the acquisition of Deeper Insights to expand our customer experience team's technology footprint and engineering talent, accelerating innovation and momentum of Cisco's CX AI capabilities and services. This investment is highly complementary to our internal R&D and aligns with our strategy to strengthen our AI position with targeted strategic M&A.\nTo summarize, we had a great quarter, with top and bottom line performance exceeding our expectations, driven by strong order growth and margins. We remained focused on making strategic investments in innovation across our business to best capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead, all underpinned by disciplined spend management. It's this powerful combination that continues to fuel our strong cash flow generation, as well as our ability to return significant value to our shareholders.\nBefore we move to the outlook, I want to provide some high-level context related to the recently proposed US tariffs. In our guidance, we have accounted for the added cost driven by the increased tariffs on China and the proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. This is a dynamic environment, but one that we have spent a significant amount of time planning for, leveraging the strength of our best-in-class global supply chain team, as well as the flexibility and agility we have built into our operations over the last few years.\nWe are prepared to take actions to mitigate the impact as and when tariffs go into effect. Turning to our financial guidance for fiscal Q3, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.9 billion to 14.1 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68%.\nNon-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.90 to $0.92. For fiscal year 2025, our guidance is we expect revenue to be in the range of $56 billion to 56.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sammy, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind the analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Michelle, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question.\nI know this might be a difficult one to answer, and I appreciate the comment on tariffs, but maybe the bigger issue around the federal government is all the noise around the DOGE. I’d love if you could drill down on your federal exposure and the scenarios you're envisioning if there are major layoffs from the US government employment. Thanks. I've got a quick follow-up. Good.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay. Thanks, Simon, for the question. Look, we have obviously been following this very significantly, and I think it's important to understand that this effort is really about driving efficiency and productivity in government, which in many cases is actually delivered via the use of technology. We think that there could be some positives for us. It's important to know that the US federal business is less than 10% of our total business, first of all.\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that 75% of our US federal business comes from the DOD, and most of this activity is actually occurring on the civilian side of the business. We still had a reasonable quarter, I'd say, when the executive orders came out. Initially, we saw a flurry of confusion, I would say, and then we've seen a lot of large deals that we've been working on sort of get back on track, and everything seems to be progressing as we expected. As you look out to Q3 and Q4, we're not modeling in any materially higher performance or any materially lower performance in federal than what we saw last quarter.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Simon. Go ahead, Simon.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nJust a follow-up, please. Yeah. There's been increasing noise around a technology known as co-package optics.\nGiven Cisco's, let's say, ingredients, having optics, vertical integration, switching, routing, just wondering how you're thinking about that in your longer-term strategy. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nI think, Simon, the way we think about it is the way we go to market with the web skillers today is that we sell them systems with integrated optics. We sell them Standalone Optics, Optical Systems, or Silicon. However the market evolves, we'll continue to evolve our offerings and evolve our portfolio to just meet them where they are and how they want to procure our products.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Simon. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. Chuck, maybe if I could ask to start just kind of what you were seeing from customers on kind of propensity to spend.\nClearly, a very good quarter, but just kind of as we've entered into the year and kind of more resolution on administration, but maybe less resolution on kind of directionality, just kind of what you're hearing from customers. Second, just on clearly, you're seeing a lot of strength on the data center side and kind of spoke to kind of seeing some of that on the campus side. How are you seeing kind of strength broaden out to the campus portfolio? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I think if you look, thanks, Meta. I think if you look across the board, we had relatively strong demand across geographies, across the portfolio, and with the exception of the US federal discussion that we had earlier, largely across segments as well. We saw public sector strength outside the US in both Europe. It was up high single digits, I think.\nIn Asia, we saw good performance as well. We saw it there. We've seen it in the campus. We talked about double-digit demand for campus switching, saw similar in enterprise routing, saw good demand for wireless, and then the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit demand growth in our Nexus portfolio or our data center switching, which predominantly goes into private cloud infrastructure into the enterprise.\nObviously, the web scale performance that we saw with three out of the six growing over 100% year over year, two of the six growing over 50% year over year. It was very balanced. So far, I think that despite the geopolitical risk, despite the uncertainty that's going on in the US.\nIn the marketplace around the world, I think the one thing our customers understand is that their need to continue spending on technology is just there. There is so much change going on right now from a technology perspective that there is both excitement about the opportunity, and candidly, there is a little bit of fear of slowing down too much and letting your competition get too much ahead of you. We saw solid demand.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Meta. I just want to remind analysts to ask one question and a follow-up question at the same time. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and, Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks a lot, guys, and congrats on the quarter. It's good to see you guys with the momentum.\nChuck, we've got a lot of questions very recently about a new switch that you just put out, the 9300 Nexus. This programmable switch market looks like there's a lot of strong prospects there. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that product and maybe why you went with AMD for the product and what that means for you versus your NVIDIA products. My follow-up just is with regard to the overall comment of just overall demand just sounds so much better than a few quarters ago.\nI just wanted some of the view that do you still think people are getting ready for AI, or I don't know if I heard that from you this time, that you were thinking the last two quarters people were getting ready for AI and it picked up, and this just sounded like a little more firm.\nI was just wondering for a little more color on that. Hopefully, that didn't run on too long, Sami. I'll pass it back to you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Ben. No, we got them both. Look, first and foremost, I want to just thank the team and our product organization because the innovation that they've been delivering over the last 12 to 18 months has been at a pace that we haven't seen in a very long time. We've seen a lot in the collab space, in the security space, a lot in the silicon space, and then in the web scale infrastructure. Now I think what you referenced, this switch with the DPU in it, is a great example of the innovation that we are going to drive in our core networking portfolio.\nI can't speak to exactly why the team chose the AMD DPU other than I'm sure they did an analysis and thought it was the best solution for us. This is a real breakthrough product because it allows us to, candidly, we can take security out of these appliances that they come in and put it where it belongs, which is everywhere. Security needs to be deployed everywhere. This really allows us to integrate security deeply into the network and at the speed of the network.\nWhat this allows us to do is you can run network services or security services on these DPUs in the network at the speed of the ASICs, as opposed to moving this traffic to a central place where you're going to be limited by the processing power of a single box.\nThe first use case, as you are aware, is Hypershield, which we announced, and we had a couple of big Fortune wins in the prior quarter, even as we're just building out the final capabilities on Hypershield. That's going to be the first deployment. If you think about the use case, you could put one of these switches sitting between zones in a data center, running all the traffic through it at line speed, and doing security inspection via Hypershield to protect different zones from east-west threats. We think it's got a lot of potential, and this is just the first service or first use case that the teams have come up with. On your second question, we absolutely believe that a lot of this demand is being driven by customers preparing for AI.\nWe even think a lot of the telco demand that we see is the telcos building out their networks to be prepared to deliver AI as a service or AI-driven services. While I didn't call it out, it's one of the pillars that we talk about relative to our role in AI. We do think there's an acceleration of companies that are just trying to get prepared for what they're going to need. It's clear that agentic AI workstreams are going to put more capacity onto the network.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Ben. Michelle, can we move to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just maybe to dovetail on the prior question. You talked about enterprises investing a little bit more in AI.\nI'm just wondering, as they've come into the new calendar year, what you're seeing and hearing specifically from enterprise customers on the AI front and how meaningful it is for your business today. As a follow-up, maybe for Scott, you did about 68.7% on a gross margin front this past quarter. I think the guide implies a step down to between 67% to 68%. I'm wondering maybe what informs that view. Thanks so much.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nI would say what we're seeing on the enterprise side relative to AI is customers are still in the very early days, and they all realize they need to figure out exactly what their use cases are. We're starting to see some spending, though, on specific AI-driven infrastructure.\nWe think as we get AI Pods out there, we got Hypershield coming, we got AI Defense coming, we have Hypershield in the market, and we got this new DPU switch. They're all going to be a part of the infrastructure to support these AI applications. We're beginning to see it happen. I think it's also really important to understand that as the enterprises leverage their private data, their proprietary data, and they'll do some training on that, and then they'll run inference, obviously, against that.\nWe believe that opportunity is an order of magnitude higher than what we've seen in training to date. We're going to continue to innovate and build capabilities to put ourselves in a better position to be a real beneficiary as this continues to accelerate. As of today, we feel like we're in pretty good shape.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nMatthew, on your question on gross margin, the guide at 67% to 68% for Q3, and by the way, I think it settles in in that range for the full year. What's built into that and driving the step down from where we were in Q2 is we have, and this was noted in my commentary upfront, we have built in the cost of the proposed tariffs that we've seen so far. The additional 10% in China, the 25% on Canada and Mexico. Canada has a negligible impact on us.\nThe steel and aluminum, we've quantified those out again, assuming the 1 March 2024 date. I think it's such a fluid environment right now. It's very difficult to say what's actually going to happen. I wanted to protect the guide and ensure that we built in the 25% that's been proposed.\nI will tell you, we've got a supply chain team that over the last several years has built a lot of muscle around the tariff that we had in China and how did we work our way around that. From the time that was first imposed to where we are now, our mitigation activities have reduced our exposure there by about 80%. We've game planned out several scenarios and steps we can take. Depending on what actually goes into effect, we'll start to take those steps to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. What I built into the cost of goods sold, that's where the tariffs will hit, is the full effect of 25% in Mexico, Canada, and the additional 10% in China, with no mitigation at this point. With no mitigation built in at this time.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Matt.\nMichelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I'll follow up on that tariff question to start off. You do mention you're embedding in the cost of the tariffs, but I think we are getting a lot of questions also in terms of how to think about demand. Chuck or Scott, I mean, any thoughts in terms of how you've seen enterprise customers respond on a demand basis to previous tariffs, and how does that inform your view in terms of what to expect for demand? Are you seeing any pull forward from customers to avoid some of these tariffs in the first place? For my follow-up, I think it's more about the hyperscaler and the AI momentum you're seeing there.\nYou're seeing strong momentum in orders, but what is maybe, if you can give us some insights on deployments, we can see the strong CapEx numbers or guidance from them, but is there any acceleration or sort of more on track in terms of deployment pace relative to what you expected? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYep. On the first question, we're not seeing any evidence of customers pulling demand ahead. I think the tariff environment is very fluid right now. It's a very dynamic environment. While everyone is taking note, I think until we know what's actually going to go into effect, it would be very difficult for our customers to decide what to do. I think the other thing is, as we look at the steps we would take to mitigate the impact of demand, there are a number of steps we can take to offset the cost.\nWe obviously would have price as a lever, but there's a number of considerations that we'd have to go through before we got there. Right now, I don't envision that. What we would look to do first is make some of the changes we need to make inside the supply chain to mitigate the impact of whatever tariff regime gets put into place. Not seeing any evidence of any pull ahead in demand.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah.\nSamik, I think on the question relative to the web scale demand versus their deployments, I think the bottom line is that I've sat with all these customers, and they've looked at me and said, if you can build more, we will buy more. I think that a couple of them had initial targets for how many units they wanted in 2025, and that number's already gone up by 50%. I think the deployments are moving very rapidly and on track, and we continue to respond to all of their demand. Frankly, the changes that they make as their strategy evolves, it's very dynamic. It's a very dynamic market.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with BofA Securities. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Research Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nHi.\nGreat quarter, but I have a question about maybe the weaker parts. If my math is right, and I'm not sure it's right, so I need clarification, Splunk was down 11% this quarter year-over-year. Maybe my numbers are totally wrong. If you can clarify what's happening with Splunk and give us an update on the trends. The second question is security and observability. It's supposed to accelerate. It accelerated last quarter. Can you talk about the trends this quarter and kind of the good parts and the bad parts of the growth? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay. I'll take the first one, then Chuck, we can tag team on the second if you want. I'm not sure what math you're doing, Pal.\nI think one thing that is not visible to you with the math that you've got in front of you is the end of Splunk's quarter, their fiscal quarter. By the way, this would have been the end of January, was the end of their prior Q4. As with every enterprise software company, of course, Q4 is the biggest quarter of the year. In fact, it gets back-end loaded so that week 13 of that Q4 is the biggest week of the quarter. The way the calendar fell this year, our fiscal quarter ended on 25 January. That last week of January that was historically Splunk's Q4 actually is not captured in our Q2 results. It'll flow into our Q3 results. That may be what's throwing you off on the math. Splunk is still growing double digits.\nIt's growing right in line with our expectations, modestly ahead of our expectations on the top line, and is profitable well ahead of when we expected it to be profitable. Splunk's performing quite nicely for us.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. On the security front, what I would say, Tal, is that look, we had always said we expected to see the acceleration in the second half of this year. We saw the last four quarters of growth from a demand perspective in organic security, which is a good sign. What we've launched is all this new innovation that just takes time to ramp. I can give you a couple of data points.\nIf you just look at two of the products, Cisco Secure Access and XDR, between those two, we now have those deployed at over 1,000 customers, and each of them are actually supporting over 1 million enterprise users each. We're seeing the success. They just need time to ramp. We've also launched Hypershield. I said earlier we won two Fortune 100 enterprise customers this past quarter, and there's a great deal of excitement. If you look at AI Defense with the AI summit that we did recently, I think there's about 20-some-odd customers who are interested in going to proof of concept with us right now on it. We had almost half the Fortune 100 there for that event. I feel good about where we are. It'll turn into greater demand as we just continue to scale these products.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Tal.\nMichelle, can we move to the next analyst?\nAhmed Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir. Great.\nThanks. This is Michael Fisher calling for Ahmed. Just a quick question on the $700 million AI orders so far this year. Are you mainly switching in optical lens, or are you seeing lenses in other products? Just curious if you're expecting any of these. You've seen some very strong AI orders. Are we expecting these to start converting into revenue this fiscal year, or is that more of a fiscal 2026? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Ahmed. I'll take the first one. Scott, you can speak to the revenue. On the $700 million in AI orders, it's a combination of systems, Silicon, Optics, and Optical systems. I think if you break it down, about half is in Silicon and systems.\nIt continues to accelerate, and I'd say the teams have done a great job on the silicon front. We've invested heavily in more resources there. The team is running parallel development efforts for multiple chips that are staggered in their time frames. They've worked hard. They are increasing the yield, which is a positive thing. We feel good about it. It's a combination of all those things that we're selling to the customers. Scott, on the revenue side?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Ahmed, it's no different than what we've said all along about when we expect this to turn into revenue. We knew the orders would come in well ahead of the actual ship dates. We do expect to see this revenue begin to ramp in the second half of the year, and that's consistent with what we've said from the start.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you for the questions.\nMichelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next caller is Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nJim Fish\n\nManaging Director and, Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, guys. Nice quarter. Working off a few of the things you guys just have talked about here, can you just first give us an update as to the actual penetration of the 6,500 large customers you guys expected between Cisco and Splunk to jointly go after, and any further bundling plans you have beyond what you just announced? Secondly, to the last question, what are you guys seeing from where you're winning within the data center between the Silicon One approach versus sort of the systems approach with your AI wins? We'd love additional cover there. Thanks, guys.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Jim. On the Splunk side, I would say it's still early.\nThese are still long sales cycles, and we're continuing to make progress. We are having wins. I mean, they're clearly out there. We also have seen the benefit of the portfolio coming together with large customers doing our broad-based, what we call WPAs, that are inclusive of Splunk now, the old Cisco WPAs that are inclusive of Splunk. We talked about the Splunk team that had a deal that they were leading that actually expanded the Cisco footprint.\nWe are beginning to see that, and we'll continue to see it as we go forward. I think you'll see as we get into the next couple of quarters, you're going to see more and more cross-selling sales incentives that the teams are putting in place, that I think will continue to accelerate that.\nOn the second question, I think it was about how they were looking at systems versus Silicon One.Yeah, systems versus Silicon.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, I think that by and large, it's systems. Actual just raw silicon sales are still very small as a percentage of the total business. The general method of consumption is just to buy the systems.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Vogt with UBS, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and, Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I'll give you both obviously at the same time. I'm just trying to square, Chuck, your comments about the strength that you're seeing across the business because it looks like Splunk enterprise orders maybe decelerated a little bit sequentially, and the strength in, I guess it looks like the Americas was mostly SP and cloud.\nThe second question I have is maybe longer term. There's been a high number or a large number of project announcements over the last couple of weeks with some pretty big announcements from maybe the white box ODM space with some big wins as well. Maybe anything you can touch on from a competitive perspective on how you're thinking about maybe these bigger projects that have been announced, maybe the risks out there from some of these other alternatives like DeepSeek, and then some of these wins that have been announced by some of the ODM market and how you're thinking about the landscape. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYep. First of all, on the enterprise, we've had four quarters of continued recovery. It was a little slower growth year-over-year than it was in Q1, but it's important to understand.\nI think Q2 over Q1 was up 29%. We literally took over $1 billion more in orders in Q2 than Q1. I don't think there's anything to be overly concerned about right there. We saw real good strength in Asia in double digits, and I think Europe was close to double digits. US enterprise just had a bunch of big deals in Q1 that I think just kind of slowed them down a little bit for Q2. On these other deals, I mean, if you look at technology like DeepSeek, we think as not DeepSeek in particular, but we think as we see more of this democratization of the access that it's going to just facilitate a faster advancement of AI applications in the enterprise, first of all. Secondly, I think we ran our AI defense model.\nI think we did 50 prompts, and the team, this was in 48 hours of this thing being out, and I think they proved every time that they could jailbreak this thing pretty easily. I think we got to be careful as well. The final thing I'd say on a lot of these unique deals out there, these bigger deals, I think we're having success in the web scale space, and I think if we're being chosen in that space, we'll have a real good opportunity to play in these other emerging opportunities as they come about as well.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, David. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nAntoine Chkaiban with New Street Research. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAntoine Chkaiban\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Technology Infrastructure, New Street Research\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I'd like to follow up on the question regarding traction from enterprise customers in AI.\nCould you provide some additional color on where you are seeing Ethernet? You mentioned the enterprise segment, what kind of cluster size, what use cases, which verticals? As a follow-up, I'd love to hear your perspective on what you're hearing from these customers in terms of data center space, and in particular, access to power as potentially being a bottleneck to roll out infrastructure this year. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Antoine. Yeah. I don't think that we're thinking about it from massive clusters that the enterprises are going to build. They're certainly building clusters to do training on their own models, or they're renting space from one of the major GPU providers to actually do their training and then pulling that back. The infrastructure we're talking about is really to support the inferencing side of it.\nI think by and large, to be candid, the customers who have bought NVIDIA GPUs so far have just bought the whole stack from them. We think that'll be an emerging opportunity in the future. Ethernet under GPUs in the enterprise today hasn't been a major opportunity to date. Now, we believe with the NVIDIA partnership, the HyperFabric stack, the AI pods, the things that we're building, we think that as we integrate that stack together and they have these reference architectures to build, we think that that will lead to our networking equipment being combined with NVIDIA GPUs, and that's how we'll accomplish that in the future. Candidly, I don't think there hasn't been a lot of concern over the power issue in the enterprise like it has been in the web scale space.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Antoine.\nMichelle, can we move to the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nAaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and, Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. I'll stick with the AI theme first, and then I'll throw out my quick follow-up. On the AI side, I think in the prepared comments you had mentioned that your 51.2T silicon will come out, I think it was April timeframe. As you think about that 50% of your business on the AI orders being tied to Switch and Silicon One silicon, would you say that that is kind of the point of inflection? The majority of your AI wins are tied to that 51.2T silicon or just kind of trying to understand kind of the opening up of this monetization opportunity?\nAs a follow-up, I'm just curious, on the campus side, just kind of help us appreciate maybe the Wi-Fi 7 upgrade cycle that you're starting to see or how you're thinking about that. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYep. I think the comments we made on the 51.2 really was more of an enterprise comment in the Nexus portfolio, but it is Silicon One based. Those chips will be used in the 8000s as an example. This is a, if you get back to the silicon discussion that we had earlier, that team is designing multiple silicon architectures based on the use cases, on the customer. Do they need deep buffers? Do they not need deep buffers? I mean, it's really, is it a low-latency application? I mean, all of these things come into play as they develop different pieces of silicon for that marketplace.\nWe'll continue to develop, and 51.2 is and then beyond, and they're already working on just subsequent chips that will continue to crank up the speeds in these data centers. On the campus side, I think that we're continuing to see the campus switching infrastructure, as I talked about earlier. It's early days on the Wi-Fi 7. I'd say customers are getting ready to begin deploying. I think we're going to move into that over the next two to three quarters where we'll see a full transition both in the traditional on-prem access points and also in the cloud-managed.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nKarl Ackerman with BNP Paribas, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nSenior Research Analyst, BNP Paribas\n\nThank you. Within enterprise networking, I think a couple of quarters ago, customer lead times bottomed out at just a few weeks.\nIs the greater visibility and support of your April quarter outlook from enterprises and even telco operators coming from just a return to normal order patterns or lead times extending out beyond a quarter across those customers as you begin to introduce AI pods and Hypershield and perhaps some on-prem service offerings in addition to that? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems",
    "content2": "It's just normalization of ordering. We haven't had any lead time pressure at all. Yeah. If what's behind that question, Carl, is the demand that we're seeing today a function of extended lead times like we saw a couple of years ago, that's not the case. Our lead times are not extending.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Carl. Michelle, we can move to the last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAtif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAdrian Colby Assistant VP and, Research Analyst]\n\nCitigroup\n\nHi. It's Adrian Colby for Atif. Thank you for taking the question.\nEarlier this week, you announced some offerings geared towards traditional service providers. I was just wondering if you could help us size this customer segment for Cisco and understand where these customers are in terms of their embrace of AI. What are some of the key issues that Cisco is helping them address?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nScott, you want to comment on the size of the telco segment for us?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, telco had a good quarter in the last quarter. That's actually a continuation of what we saw in Q1. What we hear from telco, particularly in international, is they are in anticipation of demand on their networks driven by AI doing the same thing that we hear enterprises doing. They know there's increased load coming.\nIn many cases, they've sweated those assets for some time because of the state of the financials in that industry, and they're coming back to the table to build out their networks in anticipation of the increased demand. I think we'll continue to see that for some period of time. Telco, by its nature and the size of the telco customers that we have, can be a little bit episodic, a little bit big deals in one quarter and not in the next. It is not something that I would expect to see on a steady state, but we're seeing good demand right now as they see the same thing, the same exact trend that enterprises see. There's network load coming. We need to be ready for it.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I think that's right.\nI think the other thing that we see, some of the European operators are looking at delivering AI as a service. We see a lot of them planning for AI edge applications that are sitting at the edge of their networks that they're managing for customers, etc. They are preparing for sure.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Adrian. I want to hand it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nI just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and I want to thank our teams. I'm really proud of these results, and the teams have been doing a really great job, both on the innovation front and engaging with our customers. We clearly live in a very dynamic world, and as Scott said earlier, as the impact of these potential tariffs become more clear, our teams will take the appropriate steps to mitigate where we can.\nI do feel good about our momentum. Again, the product innovation, and particularly the innovation in our core, the portfolio, and how it's translating through to customer value, clearly the AI tailwind, as well as the integration that has occurred so far relative to Splunk, and just the team's periodic execution. I'm confident in the steps we've been taking. I think it'll lead to durability of the performance, and we want to just continue to deliver for our customers, deliver the right technology, the right value, and be a trusted partner for them. Thank you for being with us, and we'll look forward to talking to you soon.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nCisco's next Quarterly Call, which will reflect our Fiscal Year 2025 Third Quarter Results, will be on Wednesday, 14 May 2025, at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThis is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we'll be providing for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2025. They're subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.\nCisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a strong close to fiscal 2024, delivering $13.6 billion US dollars in revenue for the fourth quarter, coming in above the high end of our guidance range, and $53.8 billion US dollars in revenue for the year, coupled with growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue. We also generated excellent margins, boosted by Splunk. Our gross margin of 67.5% was the highest for Cisco in 20 years. We saw steady demand as we closed the year, with total product order growth of 14% and growth of 6% excluding Splunk, indicating that the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us, as we expected.\nWe've also been investing to accelerate critical innovation in key areas, with Hypershield and Hyperfabric for AI being two outstanding examples. With Splunk now part of Cisco, we believe we have an unmatched capability to unlock the full power of the network with market-leading security and observability solutions to deliver even greater value for our customers. We have hit the ground running since we brought the Splunk and Cisco teams together, integrating powerful new customer solutions and beginning to realize early synergies. We know that our biggest competitive differentiator is the power of our full portfolio. This is why earlier today we announced that we will be bringing our networking, security, and collaboration teams together as one organization, with Jeetu Patel stepping into an expanded role as Chief Product Officer to lead this group effective immediately.\nAs we complete the full integration of Splunk into Cisco, the Splunk product line will also integrate into this new organization at the right time, bringing our entire product portfolio together as one team. With this new organization, our products will come together in a more integrated way than ever before, positioning us to deliver incredibly powerful outcomes for our customers. Looking ahead, we remain laser-focused on growth, and consistent execution as we invest to win in AI, cloud, and cybersecurity. To focus on these key priority areas, today we announced a restructuring plan to allow us to both invest in key growth opportunities, as well as drive more efficiency in our business. Now, let me share some details on our fourth quarter. We delivered solid performance in Q4, with revenue coming above the high end of our guidance range.\nStrong operating leverage across our business once again drove non-GAAP margins above the high end of our expectations, resulting in earnings per share also coming in above the high end of our guidance range. We continue to focus on growth, and our recurring revenue streams, annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue all showed solid growth, and subscriptions made up 56% of our revenue in the quarter. We also continued to deliver on our commitment to consistent capital returns. In Q4, we returned $3.6 billion US dollars in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, bringing the total to $12.1 billion US dollars in value returned in fiscal 2024, or 119% of free cash flow. In terms of customer demand, as I mentioned earlier, we saw steady demand in Q4.\nThis resulted in double-digit product order growth across all geographies, and strength in all customer markets despite persistent macro uncertainty. Public sector demand was particularly strong worldwide, driven by federal spending in the US and strength in APJC. Enterprise demand returned to strength in the quarter, with solid performance in the Americas and EMEA, and even stronger results in APJC. We signed several $100 million+ US dollars transactions in the quarter with global enterprises who are leveraging the breadth of our technology platforms to modernize and automate their network operations, and deploy next-generation machine learning and AI applications. I'd like to highlight one of the largest deals we signed in the quarter with a leading global logistics company to advance their efforts in creating the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent logistics network.\nCisco's technology platforms across switching, routing, security, and observability will enable our customer to automate network operations with cutting-edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched supply chain visibility. We also signed our first cross-portfolio agreement that includes Splunk with a major automotive company in this quarter. AI is transforming every aspect of our customers' IT environments. They need to modernize their infrastructure, harness the full power of AI and data, and improve their cybersecurity posture, all while building agility and resiliency across their entire digital footprint. Our customers continue to put their trust in Cisco, and we are very well positioned to be their strategic partner for this era. In service provider, while our telco and cable customer demand remained muted overall amid continued industry-wide pressure, we saw strength in EMEA driven by investment in AI operations and autonomous networks by service providers to help them monetize their B2B offerings.\nWe are also encouraged to see signs of stabilization and improved performance in web scale in terms of pipeline and demand, with double-digit order growth. To provide some incremental color, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products. Excluding Splunk, security product orders grew double digits, collaboration product orders grew double digits, and in our networking portfolio, data center switching also saw double-digit product order growth. Enterprise routing, campus switching, and wireless orders were also strong, with wireless orders greater than 1 million up more than 20% year-over-year as customers look to enhance their office environments. Across the breadth of our portfolio and global customer base, our product order results demonstrate strengthening demand as our customers focus on their next top priority technology investments.\nWhile customers continue to ruthlessly prioritize their investments, our product order results demonstrate that our customers continue to look to Cisco as they focus on their most important technology initiatives. Turning to look at our product categories in more detail, we saw revenue growth in security, and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk, as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. We've had extremely positive feedback from customers with early access to Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network. Hypershield furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats, and we look forward to making it available this fall. Our new security solutions, XDR, and Secure Access, are continuing to gain strong traction.\nWe added over 230 new XDR customers in Q4. Early in the quarter, we announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, and at the Black Hat Cybersecurity Conference earlier this month, we announced the availability of Talos Incident Response for Splunk customers, enabling access to the full suite of proactive and emergency services to help prepare for, respond to, and recover from a breach. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. We have now crossed $1 billion US dollars in AI orders with web scale customers to date, with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI Fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. We expect an additional $1 billion US dollars of AI product orders in fiscal year 2025.\nAs I shared at our investor day in June, this momentum is being fueled by multiple use cases in production with the hyperscalers, several of which are in AI. In addition, we have multiple design wins, with roughly two-thirds of these in AI. Over and above the web scale AI opportunity, we believe we are well positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI application proliferation in the enterprise. Our Hyperfabric AI cluster solution, created with NVIDIA, helps our enterprise customers build infrastructure to run generative AI models and inference applications. The on-premise solution will guide users from design to validated deployment to monitoring and assurance when it becomes available later this fiscal year. We are also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience organization. We have a robust AI and automation framework that touches at least 50% of our service requests.\nIn addition, we are incorporating AI assistance into our products so that our customers and partners have efficient options to access support. Before I hand it over to Scott, I want to take a moment to thank our teams for all their hard work to close out the year, and their relentless focus on our customers. In closing, while we're pleased with our performance in a dynamic environment, we know we have to drive strong execution to be successful in the growing markets we serve. We believe this will result in strong growth and profitability as we enter fiscal 2025. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance.\nOur Q4 results reflect solid execution, with strong margins and strength in orders as customer buying patterns begin to return to normal. For the quarter, total revenue was above the high end of our guidance range at $13.6 billion US dollars, down 10% year-over-year, comparing against our strongest quarter ever in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Splunk contributed approximately $960 million US dollars in revenue for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion US dollars. Non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87 US dollars. The interest impact from financing the Splunk acquisition more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.04 US dollars on non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter.\nLooking at our Q4 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.9 billion US dollars, down 15% as we moved through the final quarter of customer inventory issues, and services revenue was $3.8 billion US dollars, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 28% when compared to our Q4 2023 networking revenues, which benefited from near-record shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 81%, including the benefit from Splunk. Excluding Splunk, security grew 6%, driven by competitive wins and growth in SASE, and double-digit growth in network security. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and CPaaS offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. Observability was up 41%, driven by growth in our observability suite, our Splunk observability offering, and ThousandEyes Network Services. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 12% for the quarter.\nLooking at our recurring metrics, ARR ended the quarter at $29.6 billion US dollars, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 43%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25.3 billion US dollars, up 4%, and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 17% to $7.7 billion US dollars, which now represents 56% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 2%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 15% at $5.3 billion US dollars, with software subscription revenue up 25%. 92% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, software revenue was down 5% due to declines in perpetual license software as we moved to more subscription-based software arrangements. Software subscription revenue was up 2%. Total RPO was $41.0 billion US dollars, up 18%, due to both strong organic performance and the addition of Splunk.\nProduct RPO grew 27%. Total short-term RPO was up 17%. Without Splunk, RPO was $37.5 billion US dollars, up 8%, with product RPO also grew at 8%. As Chuck said, Q4 product orders were up 14% year-over-year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 6% year-over-year, indicating the period of inventory digestion by our customers is now largely behind us. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments year-over-year, Americas was up 15%, EMEA was up 12%, and APJC was up 16%. In our customer markets, public sector was up 20%, enterprise was up 13%, and service provider and cloud was up 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 67.0%, up 150 basis points, largely driven by Splunk and favorable product mix offset by price.\nServices gross margin was 70.3%, up 280 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 32.5%. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $17.9 billion US dollars . Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $3.6 billion US dollars to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion US dollars for our quarterly cash dividend, and $2.0 billion US dollars of share repurchases. We took advantage of market conditions to increase our share repurchases during the quarter. Turning to the full fiscal year, we delivered strong margins and increased our operating leverage. Revenue at $53.8 billion US dollars made fiscal 2024 Cisco's second-strongest year on record as compared to the all-time high revenues of $57 billion US dollars in fiscal 2023, which benefited from significant shipments of heightened backlog.\nSplunk contributed approximately $1.4 billion US dollars in revenue after the close of the acquisition in March of this year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.73 US dollars, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, down 4% year-over-year. Splunk was $0.04 US dollars dilutive to full-year earnings, including the impact of financing costs. In terms of our recurring metrics, total software revenue for the full year was up 9% at $18.4 billion US dollars, with the product portion also up 9%. Software subscription revenue was up 15%. 89% of total software revenue was subscription-based. Without Splunk, total software revenue was up 1%. Total subscription revenue was $27.4 billion US dollars, an increase of 11%. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 6%. As Chuck mentioned, total non-GAAP gross margin was 67.5%, up 300 basis points, and the highest in 20 years. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $15.2 billion US dollars. Operating cash flow was $10.9 billion US dollars.\nAs a reminder, cash flow was impacted by the timing of large tax payments in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. In the year, we returned $12.1 billion US dollars in value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. This was comprised of $6.4 billion US dollars in quarterly cash dividends and $5.8 billion US dollars of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year in fiscal 2024, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year, and we exited the year with order levels improving as customers largely completed the implementation of record Cisco product shipments. Further, as Chuck mentioned, we are realigning our expenses to better capture the opportunities ahead.\nAs part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 7% of our global workforce with total estimated pre-tax charges of up to $1 billion US dollars. Turning to our financial guidance for fiscal Q1, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.65 to 13.85 billion US dollars. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.86 to 0.88 US dollars. In Q1, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. For fiscal year 2025, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $55 to 56.2 billion US dollars. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.52 to 3.58 US dollars.\nWe're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our first caller is Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Chuck, I just wanted to maybe start with you in terms of what you're seeing in terms of budget prioritization from customers. Clearly, they're coming out of a digestion period, but just any sense of how they're balancing different enterprise or initiatives, particularly trying to balance AI initiatives. Then maybe second, just for Scott, is the full RIF embedded in the fiscal 2025 guidance? Just any clarification. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Meta. Yeah, I would say if you look across the portfolio, just if I go around the world a little bit on the demand side, from a geographic perspective, it was very balanced. Americas and Europe were up 6%, Asia was up 8%. All these numbers are excluding Splunk, and I'm going to talk about that real quickly. The segments, enterprise was +3%, cloud and SP was +2%, and public sector was +15%. We saw pretty balanced strength there. Across the technology portfolio, it was incredibly balanced. We saw double-digit growth, as we said, in security, double-digit growth in collaboration, and in the networking space, I think it's important to point out the switching business and the enterprise routing. The enterprise switching and the enterprise routing businesses were both up high single digits, and the wireless business was up double digits.\nI think Scott had in his remarks that the number of $1 million US dollars transactions in wireless alone was up 20% year-over-year. We saw super balanced demand across the portfolio. The one thing I would say that we heard for the first time this quarter that we haven't heard before is that enterprise customers are now actually upgrading their infrastructure in preparation for AI. In some cases, they're taking some of the dollars that they've set aside for AI to actually spend it on modernizing their infrastructure in order to get ready for that. You saw that with some of the examples we gave in these platform sales. The large logistics company that we have actually bought the cross-portfolio solution, the whole Cisco platforms, and they're looking to enable AI-powered robotics, AI-powered supply chain visibility, etc.\nWe think we're beginning to see customers actually prepare for AI applications, even though in many cases they may not know the full range of what they will be deploying, but they know they need to be ready. That's kind of what we saw.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nMeta, I want to make sure I got your second question right. Did you say is the full risk embedded in fiscal 2025 guidance?\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nJust the layoffs that were announced, just whether that is fully embedded, the savings from the 7% cut are embedded in the fiscal 2025 guidance.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, it is. It's a good place to kind of explain in a little bit more detail what that action is about. It's not about cost saving. The answer is yes, it's embedded in the guide.\nIt's much more about finding efficiencies across the company so that we can pivot more resources, much like we did last year, into the fastest growth areas within the company, which are pivoting more into AI, pivoting more into cloud, and pivoting more into cybersecurity. Think of it more as reallocating versus being in pursuit of cost savings. Yes, it's all built into the guide.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Meta, I would just add on that one that we actually are shifting hundreds of millions of dollars into AI, into AI networking for cloud, into AI infrastructure, silicon, and cyber. It's a meaningful shift. We feel like the market's moving so quickly, we have to do that.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Meta. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with BofA Securities. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nHi, guys.\nThe last question a little bit stole my thunder somewhat, but I want to ask it anyway. On one hand, there is always a correlation between business cycles and restructuring. Here you see a company that is improving on all fronts with orders growing, and still you're announcing a major 7% restructuring. Is there anything in the environment that makes you more cautious? Is there anything that drives the timing of this restructuring ahead of what is expected to be a good year? I'm wondering what can we learn from your view on the environment given the timing of restructuring.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nLet me make a.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nI'll ask one.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nOkay. I'll just ask my second question together. It's a quick one. On security, great performance, finally improving. Was there any implication of what we've seen with CrowdStrike?\nHave you seen any change in purchasing behavior or any different dynamics among customers because of what happened with CrowdStrike? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Tal. Let me just make a comment on the restructuring there, Scott. You can talk a little bit about it, and then I'll take the security question back. On the restructuring, the answer to that is no, there's nothing else out there. We had tremendous demand across the portfolio. It was very broad-based, and it was very consistent. It really is about ensuring in a rapidly moving market that we serve that we're able to shift resources into the most important areas. That's really it. Scott, anything to add?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nJust, Tal, this is just a continuation of what you've seen us do.\nWe talked at Investor Day about having already pivoted on the R&D front, a little more than 50% of our R&D spend into those three areas, into AI, cloud, and cybersecurity. Obviously, networking continues to be incredibly important to us, and we'll continue to support that space as well. It's looking for efficiencies as we look across the company, really in every way, so that we can take those resources and allocate them into the fastest growing spaces. I think it's—think of it as more of just the financial discipline that you've always seen from us. I mean, you just look at the year we just closed. Obviously, it was a challenging year on the top line for revenue, yet we reported the highest operating margin in the history of the company. This is just more of the financial discipline that I think you've known us for.\nOn the security question, Tal, if you think back to about a year ago, what I had said, I felt like what happened is that we would start seeing improvement in the second half of fiscal 2024. We were high single digits in Q3, we were double digits in Q4, and I said we should see the real momentum kick in in 2025. I think that's what we're feeling, the beginning of that. As it relates specifically to CrowdStrike, it's hard for me to say. I will tell you that we added 230 more XDR customers. We're pushing 600 customers on that platform, which is a pretty significant decision when customers make that decision, so that's encouraging. Candidly, the Secure Access product that is the cloud-edge security solution is actually ramping even faster than XDR did.\nThe teams have done a great job with this innovation. We have 2,200 customers now that are using our AI assistant in security, and that's very encouraging as well. We're really optimistic about what the teams have been doing in this space.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Tal. Michelle, we'll go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Before I ask the question, congratulations to G2 on the expanded role as well. Maybe just starting off with the AI orders, Chuck, I think you mentioned you already cumulatively crossed $1 billion US dollars and are on track for the $1 billion US dollars next year. Maybe if you can give us some sense on what's the current sort of run rate that you're hitting relative to the $1 billion US dollars target you have for next year.\nAs you sort of get more visibility in terms of some of these deployments, how you're thinking about the orders, timing of the orders translating into revenue. I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYou want to follow up now?\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nSami, could you ask the follow-up now, please?\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. On the follow-up, I was just really going to more ask about what's embedded in terms of the guide relative to the Splunk growth versus the core business. If we are sort of calculating it right, it looks like Splunk's growth was about 5% in the quarter. Looks a bit more subdued than sort of the double-digit growth I think everyone was expecting. Any guide, any sort of thoughts on why it was a bit more subdued if I'm doing the math right and how to think about sort of what's embedded in the guide for fiscal 2025?\nThank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. On the AI orders, we did talk about the fact that we crossed $1 billion US dollars to date in the web scale space, which is solid. At Investor Day, we talked about the number of design wins we've had, which are wins where we have received the go-ahead from these customers that they're going to go with us assuming we execute and deliver on the design as they have spec'd it. We're only two and a half weeks into the year, so it's hard to say right now how those are going to flow throughout the balance of the year. I will say that one of the absolute largest players in this space actually told us last week that they are releasing orders in one of those design wins.\nOne of those design wins will start to generate orders in the near future. I think things are playing out as we expected. Candidly, it's just up to us to execute and deliver on what they've asked us to deliver.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. To make on Splunk, as we said in the opening commentary, it's progressing right in line with our expectations. The focus of that transaction was much more about driving revenue. Of course, it's a long sales cycle. We've already seen, as Chuck mentioned, a double-digit number of deals that have closed with our two sales forces selling together. The momentum in the field is good. Splunk, the better metric for Splunk, we talked about revenue because that obviously shows up in the P&L. The better metric for them is ARR.\nTheir ARR is continuing to grow in double digits, which is right where it was the last time they reported as a public company. Still continuing to see good momentum and beginning to see the green shoots of the sales forces really selling together. We've also done a fair number of product integrations. I think Chuck talked about several of those in his piece of the script. What's going to happen over time is it's going to be harder and harder to say, with these integrated product sets, what is Splunk revenue and what is Cisco revenue. I will tell you, we've built in the full impact of where we expect the combined company to be.\nI think defining longer term, how much of that is allocated to historical Splunk and how much of that's allocated to historical Cisco is going to get tougher and tougher. What I'd tell you is it's built in, it's performing well. We're already seeing good signs of the sales forces selling together, and it's built into the guide.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, I think that's really important, Scott, because we said that Splunk typically has a six to nine-month sales cycle. We closed, I think, over 10 of these cross-sale deals that were worked between the Cisco sales force and the Splunk sales force last quarter, which was promising. We also, as I said, in my comments, did the first cross-portfolio agreement that would have traditionally been a Cisco offer to one of our largest customers in the US. We actually transacted it with Splunk included in that.\nWe're beginning to see what we would have expected at this point, and maybe even a little ahead of what I would have expected at this point.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Samik. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. George Notter with Jefferies, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thanks very much, guys. I wanted to ask about putting the organization together, networking, security, collaboration. Can you talk a bit about what's driving that integration? I assume you're going to talk about the need for products to be integrated, especially as we leverage AI, leverage big data sets. Can you walk through kind of the precise motivations driving it? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, George, thank you. You nailed it, actually. You could answer for me.\nI think if you look at what our biggest competitive differentiation is in the marketplace, it's really when we do deep cross-integration across the portfolio, and we're delivering on a platform strategy for our customers. I felt like with the pace at which the AI revolution is moving and what our enterprise customers need from us, and candidly, as security and networking continue to become more tightly intertwined, I just felt like it was important for us to have a single leader. If you look at what G2 has accomplished in his four years here when he took on the collaboration business originally, I think everybody remembers what the portfolio was like then versus what it's doing now with double-digit growth this quarter. Obviously, in the security portfolio, he's done exactly as we had expected. I think we have a great networking team.\nI think his focus on execution, innovation, and sense of urgency is going to be really welcome there. We look forward to seeing what the teams accomplish and the innovation that they'll deliver in the future.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, George. Michelle, can we move to the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYep. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to stop that, Chuck, your commentary around customer demand patterns kind of getting back to normal, the orders showing positive growth, all sound really good. Maybe you'd just contrast that and help us frame that versus your guidance for overall revenues being up 3% inclusive of Splunk. There's obviously a fear that Cisco is losing shares.\nMaybe you can just talk about how to think about your revenue growth, what headwinds you have for maybe backlog normalization that should be factored into this 3% to 3.5% revenue guide. That would be really helpful to sort of understand. Perhaps just as a follow-up, Scott, can you just quantify what sort of cost savings are you expecting from this reduction program? I realize none of this will flow to the bottom line. It sounds like you want to invest it back in the business. Just to frame it up, what sort of savings on a gross level maybe you expect from these cost reduction initiatives? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Amit, on the first one, we've talked about this in the past. The headwind that we have for fiscal 2025, we talked about this back on the Q3 call and again at our Investor Day.\nWe still have a tough compare in Q1, as you know. Q1 of fiscal 2024, the year that just ended, we had a significant amount of product shipments from excess backlog. Round numbers, $4 billion US dollars of shipment included in those Q1 numbers. Obviously, you can only ship that backlog once. We do not get to ship that again in Q1 of this year. That not only creates a dislocation in what the growth rates are for Q1, but it impacts the entire year as well. One of the things that we talked about on the last call was if you looked at our growth rate of the core business and said X backlog and X Splunk, you can do the pencil math and see what is that growth rate. It is in that same range that we gave you for the long-term growth rate.\nThat's what's kind of underneath the positive news that we're seeing around demand returning to normal patterns. The headwind that that creates to revenue growth for the year is in the guide. On the cost reductions from the actions that we're taking, it really is a case, much like it was last year, of us finding those efficiencies across the company and really reallocating. Think of it as much more of a reallocation process than it is a cost savings process. This is the same financial discipline you've seen from us for the last couple of years. As I said in answering the question earlier, kind of the hallmark of that is when you look at a year, which this was a tough year in terms of revenue production.\nWith the discipline that we have, we still delivered the highest operating margin we have in the history of the company. Think of it that way. We need to pivot more resources into the fastest growth areas of our business, and we're doing it by finding efficiencies and then reallocating those costs.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Amit. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. I'm interested in maybe unpacking a little bit of the $1 billion US dollars of incremental AI orders you talked about for fiscal 2025.\nWhat I'm sort of trying to understand is, are you looking at this as sort of more of the same, meaning very similar in the customer mix and product mix of the first $1 billion US dollars, or are we expecting the beginning of maybe enterprise adoption for inferencing, or what's the nature of that incremental $1 billion US dollars? My follow-up is quick and probably one that might be a little bit trickier to answer. What are you budgeting for fiscal 2025 OpEx? I think we're all trying to get to that one way or another. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Simon. I'll take the AI one. I would say that it doesn't have a meaningful amount of enterprise built into it.\nWe are beginning to see the enterprise pipeline build a bit, but it's mostly, predominantly the same thing that we've talked about in the past, which is a web scale infrastructure space. If the enterprise picks up materially somewhere along the way, then that number could be higher. The other thing I'd point out is I also believe over time it's going to get more and more difficult to really identify orders that are AI-related because, as I said earlier, we're beginning to see enterprises now that are updating their infrastructure as a result of AI. Does that count as an AI order or not? Anyway, we're going to stay pretty pure to how we've measured them so far as we continue to update you on these numbers. I think that's how it's going to play out over the course of the year.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nSimon, on your second question, obviously for the full year, we don't guide at that level. We've given you revenue, we've given you what to expect on EPS. For Q1, we also gave you the ranges for gross margin and op margin. Below the op margin line in OI&E, we've talked about the interest impact of the money that we spent to acquire Splunk. I think you understand what that looks like. What I'd give you as an additional modeling point is when you look through the year, we talked about the Q1 guide being gross margin in the 67% to 68% range and op margins being in the 32% to 33% range. It stays pretty well in that range for the full year as well.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Simon.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThank you Chuck.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nWe can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. On the point around the platform approach, maybe, Chuck, if you can speak to where the platform approach is resonating more across your different customer sets within enterprise, SP, and public sector. How much of these purchasing decisions, primarily around buying networking and security adjacent to one another, how much of this is actually being done in unison today? Where do you think that goes over time? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Matthew. I think that, look, these are happening primarily in the large enterprise and in large public sector customers. That's where we see it. In the quarter, we had large enterprise and large public sector customers that actually executed on these nine-figure deals. It's happening across a broad array of customers in different industries.\nI would say that when it comes to security and networking, you're seeing it particularly at the cloud edge, as you know, when you see SD-WAN and the cloud security coming together. We're also beginning to see it, and we're going to actually drive it in the data center with Hypershield, where you have security embedded deeply in the network. I think that one of the key benefits of the organizational change that we've made is that you're going to see more and more innovation that is going to actually come from us where the security and the network are more tightly connected in the future.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nMatt, what I'd add to the second part of your question, kind of how much of the large deals and where does that go, just a quick data point for you.\nWe talked about product order growth, ex-Splunk being at 6%. If you netted out these large, we call them whole portfolio agreements, if you netted those out of both years, actually the product order bookings growth goes up modestly. Think of it as being in the same range. While it was a good quarter for that, it always is in Q4, it's not the outsized driver of our growth. We're seeing growth really across the board.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Matthew. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, guys. A couple of questions for me. First, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you had in the slides four examples of $100 million US dollars platform deals, multiple platforms, I guess, within each single customer.\nMaybe can you talk about where all of these customers were naturally big Cisco customers before these renewals and deals? I guess the question is, where is the incremental value? In what product areas do you see yourself really gaining more from a footprint when you're coming with these platform deals? The second question relates to the cloud order growth. Only two points, if I'm getting that right, not all that impressive this quarter. Maybe you can unpack that a little bit more. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, thanks, Ittai. You're right. Most of these large platform deals are existing customers, for sure. In some cases, this is the first time we've done one. In some cases, it's a renewal of one we did three, five years ago. It varies.\nI would say in all the customers, I'd say the big thing that's probably an expansion for us now is the real recognition that the security portfolio is much more robust. The innovation that's been driven in that platform, I think, is one of the advantages that the customers are really seeing through these platform deals that we're seeing. Also, again, I think when you get into the use cases, it's really important to understand that some of them are actually doing these now in preparation for these AI workloads, like the AI-powered robotics example that we gave earlier. On the cloud order growth, that 2% was a combination of traditional service provider and cloud, the hyperscalers. If you look at the hyperscalers, we saw very significant growth in the second half of the year and in Q4. We said double digits.\nI would just say it was meaningful. It was really refreshing to see. As Scott said earlier, we feel like this digestion period is behind us now, as we had hoped and thought it would be by the end of Q4. We hope to see normal buying behavior in the hyperscalers over the coming quarters.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Ittai. Thank you, Ittai. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nJames Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\n\nJames Fish\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. You guys are reducing 7% of the workforce. Based on your comments, Scott, it sounds as though that is kind of the gross number. Is there a way to think about sort of that net number by year-end and how many employees are actually affected?\nAs a follow-up, obviously, Gary's been now in his role for a bit longer, and you guys are starting a new fiscal year here. How are you guys thinking about changes to the sales efforts or compensation structures with this kind of ongoing restructuring and meanwhile this kind of push more towards a platform sale? Thanks, guys.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Jim, I'll start. I think, again, think of that as the reduction that we're doing as much more of a reallocation versus a headcount savings. In some cases, the efficiencies that we're going to get will be by moving into lower-cost locations. It's not as easy to do the math to say, like, hey, if you were 90,000 heads before and 7%, I expect you to be at whatever the math works out to. Some of that is not going to be just a one-for-one headcount change.\nIt's going to be savings that come by putting more work into lower-cost locations. I don't think the math is going to help you as you try to build out your model. I think from Gary's perspective, he's not on the call with us today, but I think he's focused on we're putting in cross-sale incentives for Splunk on the Cisco Salesforce. We're going to incent the security sellers inside Cisco. We're looking at the Splunk Salesforce over time being able to sell the security portfolio from Cisco. He's focused on simplicity, more frontline quota-carrying reps, investing in more capacity in the enterprise space where these platform deals are more prevalent, more systems engineering, and a real doubling down on the focus on core networking and infrastructure.\nI think you're going to see a real renewed effort to get the teams focused not only on some of the software assets and security, but really doubling down on core networking.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Jim. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask you, Chuck, a little bit more about the getting ready for AI, the uptick in orders where you see folks getting ready. Did you mean some of the wireless orders where they're anticipating using apps, or did you mean that they're anticipating doing training on top of some LLMs?\nI just wanted a little more if you had any insight as to what they're really using it for and which area of your portfolio that you're really seeing it in, and if you're getting a sense for what they're really prepping for. Oh, sorry. My follow-up is just with regard to NVIDIA. A follow-up there is with regard to your orders. It sounds like enterprise is small with regard to the AI orders, but wondering if you're seeing any interest in the NVIDIA partnership yet. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ben. On the enterprise AI, what I would say is some customers, like these platform deals that we talked about, they're buying the entire portfolio to refresh their infrastructure because they have applications that they've already identified, like the ones we were referencing earlier.\nIn other cases, they are updating their data center infrastructure and their core network infrastructure to be ready for smaller training models on their own private data and/or inference. It just varies across the board. I think, to be honest with you, that a lot of customers would tell you that we're not really sure exactly what the applications are going to look like. I know one thing for sure is that I need to have a modern and up-to-date infrastructure to be prepared for that. I'm just going to go in and see where do I need to make those investments. In some cases, I may need to update my switching infrastructure. In some cases, it may be new wireless. We saw data center switching in double digits as well. I think it was fairly broad-based.\nI'd say on the NVIDIA partnership, it's too early. We're not even in early field trials yet with that solution. I don't think there's a lot to share yet.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Ben. Thanks, Scott. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Sticking on the AI theme, as we think about this billion of orders, I think last quarter you talked about line of sight into the billion going into fiscal 2025. I'm curious if you can unpack that a little bit in terms of are these back-end network deployments, competing against Arista, internal switching offerings from the cloud guys, and is it switching? Is it Silicon One? Full switch? Is there any kind of granularity you can give within that billion-dollar orders?\nI'll spin my second question. As we think about the Splunk contribution in fiscal 2025, if we annualize the fourth-quarter contribution, to me, it's going to lead me to think that core Cisco's kind of flattish, kind of embedded in your guidance for the full year. Is that fair? If so, how are you thinking about the networking growth for the full-year guide? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, on the $1 billion US dollars, I would say it is primarily back-end, and it is a combination of both Ethernet and optics. We have a very robust optics business, and it is competing with the players that you would suspect we would compete with. In some cases, it's a system from us. In some cases, it's perhaps a white-box solution. One of the big advantages we have is that we can actually sell them silicon.\nWe can help them build white boxes, or we can sell them integrated systems. It's a combination of all those things, as well as optics. On the second one, you want to take?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, well, Aaron, this is back to what I was touching on earlier. If you remember, Q1 of fiscal 2024, the compare point for our current quarter, also had a pretty significant amount of excess backlog clearance in it. We talked about it at Investor Day that it was in the $3.5 to 4 billion US dollars range of clearance. That happened in Q1 a year ago. Obviously, that won't repeat in Q1 of this year. While we're seeing a nice normalization of demand across the board, we've got that year-on-year headwind compare of not being able to have the significant backlog clearance again in Q1 of this year.\nAdd that to your math, and you'll get a different outcome on what's happening in the core.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. Thanks guys.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Aaron. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead.\n\nAdrienne Colby\n\nAssistant VP and Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, it's Adrienne Colby for Atif. With regards to the inventory levels normalizing and a bit to the prior question, how should we think about the quarterly trends in the business? Are we sort of back to a scenario with regular sort of prior seasonal dynamics, or as the business mix has evolved, are things changing? Also, as we think about fiscal year 2025, how should we think about the January dynamic with Splunk? It looks like historically that was a pretty strong quarter for Splunk.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI'll answer the first, and then Scott, you can take the second.\nWe believe that we are finally back to normal ordering patterns. We were talking about it as we were getting ready for this call, and it's literally been four years that we've been going through this between COVID and then the supply chain shock and then having to deal with this digestion challenge at the end. We're quite happy to be here, but we feel like we are back to normal ordering patterns. It should be like it was prior to the pandemic. Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. On the January dynamic on Splunk, like most enterprise software companies, not only do they get back-end loaded into what was previously their fourth quarter, the January quarter that you talked about, but they also get very back-end loaded within that quarter to the very end of it, right? You see that with almost all enterprise software companies.\nThe one bit of normalization that we've had to do as we brought Splunk in, our fiscal quarters don't actually end on the last day of the month. They end on the last Saturday of the month of that quarter. There's typically a tail of two or three days that would be the normal end of the Splunk quarter that doesn't fall into the end of our quarter. It'll be a muted impact on our second, that January quarter is our second quarter. It'll have a muted impact because we'll lose two or three days, which are two or three big days out of our Q2. Some of that will bleed over into Q3 for us.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Adrienne. Michelle, we can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead.\n\nKarl Ackerman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Semiconductors and IT Hardware, BNP Paribas\n\nYes, thank you. You indicated that inventory digestion for hyperscale and enterprise networking is largely behind you. Though, Scott, I think you noted in general that price was somewhat of a headwind to product revenue in the quarter. Could you speak to the rate of change in the improving order visibility since the beginning of this year? In other words, has visibility improved from three months to, say, six to nine months? Second, do you anticipate the pricing environment stabilizing or improving from here as you look to your fiscal 2025 revenue outlook? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI would say on the ability to look out and see the demand side, notwithstanding some unforeseen shock, I think the teams are back to their normal visibility. I think that I'm trying to even remember what it was. It's been so long ago since we had it.\nI think they clearly have much greater visibility over the next 90-day period. We've seen that the last couple of quarters. Obviously, with this final Q4 where we think that the issue is behind us, I think going forward, you'll see it. I think we'll continue to see greater visibility into the outer quarters relative to where we were over the last couple of years.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, and on price stability, Karl, if you go, you got to go back a ways, as Chuck just said. If you go back to where we were before the supply chain issues and then, of course, the price increases that we had to put in place because our cost went up significantly, it took a while, as you remember, for those price increases to turn into orders, those orders to work through the backlog, and get shipped out.\nWe've now sort of lapped the point where we've gotten to price stability. Expect to see price impact back where it's always been historically. Typically, every deal we do is a competitive deal, all right? There's always some price competition around that, but expect it to be in the range that it was historically, somewhere in that anywhere from 0.5% to 1.5% per quarter.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Karl. I want to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks. I want to thank all of you for joining again today. We appreciate you being with us. I want to thank our teams, our customers, and our partners for helping us with a strong finish to the challenging year.\nAs we stated, we think the inventory digestion is complete, and we're now returning to a more normalized demand environment. I'm encouraged by the broad-based demand that we saw in the quarter across the, and the continued progress we're making with our customers around AI and particularly cybersecurity, as well as core networking, and beginning to see that it is actually getting a lift from AI in the enterprise space. We're very pleased with the progress we've made with Splunk, with the early traction, and some of the wins. You can count on us for continued financial discipline, as you always have seen. You can also count on us to continue to invest in the future, as we're doing in AI infrastructure, networking, silicon, and cyber, to drive future growth and future profitability. Thank you for being with us, and we look forward to seeing you all soon.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you all for joining us. Fiscal's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2025 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, 13 November 2024, at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time. I'll hand it over to Michelle.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 866-510-4837.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect now. I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nWelcome everyone to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. Given our recently closed acquisition of Splunk, we are also joined by Gary Steele, the former CEO of Splunk, which is now a Cisco company. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of Fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements with respect to guidance. Please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.\nCisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Sami. Thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3 with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better than anticipated earnings per share performance. We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team, as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger.\nAcross networking and Silicon, observability, security, collaboration, and AI, the strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter, with a total of $8.5 billion in value returned year to date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on 18 March 2024, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over $4 billion in annualized recurring revenue, and adds to our position as one of the largest software companies in the world.\nWe are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations, using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco HyperShield, our most significant new security innovation, with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security. A first of its kind combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, HyperShield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments, but now I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand.\nThe breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track, as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, Data Center Switching and Campus Switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories.\nOverall, product orders were up 4%, and excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-on-year in our customer markets. Public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the US temporarily impacted Public Sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent US Federal government funding legislation. While our Telco and Cable customer demand remain muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in webscale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we move through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution, and gives us confidence in the long term.\nWe also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever, as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in Security, and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk, as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation in security, and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month we introduced Cisco HyperShield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric.\nThis new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment in software, and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access, continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets.\nUpon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers, and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Security, Incident, and Event Management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk salesforces, and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity in web scale.\nWe continue to see momentum with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI Fabric, leveraging Cisco validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2-terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year 2025, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal 2025. Additionally, for those leading edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy to deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing.\nWe believe we are well positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our Chief Customer and Partner Officer, is departing Cisco and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of Go-to-Market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence, and in this new role he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco.\nGary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role, and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending toward normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our Security and Observability portfolios have continued to grow, and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it, and the Security to protect it.\nWe believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all three. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem, and ability to support hybrid and multicloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution, with strong margins and a stabilization of orders, both including and excluding Splunk. Our revenue, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was $12.7 billion, down 13% year-over-year. Splunk contributed $413 million in revenue in the partial quarter.\nPost close.\nNon-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing the Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of one penny on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9 billion, down 19%, and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across most all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, security grew 3%, driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our Zero Trust offering.\nCollaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. Observability was up 27%, driven by growth in ThousandEyes Network Services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25 billion, up 5%, and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to $6.9 billion, which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $4.5 billion, with software subscription revenue up 17%.\nWithout Splunk, total software revenue was down 4%, and software subscription revenue was up 6%. 91% of our total software revenue was subscription based. Total RPO was $38.8 billion, up 21%. Due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition, product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was $20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was $35.3 billion, up 10%, with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat. Year over year, we see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations, and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%.\nIn our customer markets, Service Provider and Cloud was up 10%, Public Sector was up 6%, and Enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was $4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of $27.4 billion.\nRelated to our acquisition of Splunk, and in line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year to date, we've returned $8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk for Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.4 to 13.6 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.\nOur Q4 guidance includes $950 million to $1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of -$0.03. As the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit in Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18% for fiscal year 2024. Our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.6 to 53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range next year.\nSecond is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go to market engine, and expect to invest in OpEx in fiscal 2025 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal 2025 operating margin to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. As we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal 2026 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nThanks a lot for taking my question. I have two. I'll ask them both at the same time. Chuck, it's really nice to hear about inventory digestion sort of being done, in order growth, getting back to flat, growing in some of the verticals. Some of the tech companies, I guess, have talked about a softer macro environment that's resulting in some positive spending. I'd love to understand, kind of away from the inventory digestion that you see, that seems like it's happening, what are you seeing from a macro environment, and if that's actually starting to improve as well for you folks. If I could just follow up on a different side, the $1 billion of AI orders that you have, you know, that you see, that you believe you can get in fiscal 2025.\nCan you just talk about, you know, is this other wins more coming from the Silicon One side, or optical, or on the switching solution? Just any flow. On kind of where you, where do. You expect to get these wins would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Amit, appreciate the questions. From a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically we saw the quarter actually show slight improvement as we moved through the quarter. The end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. We obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter, so that's positive. You know, we saw the Americas excluding Splunk was up 2%, so that was a positive sign. Europe was flat, so that was good. When you see Campus Switching and Data Center Switching, both were positive. By the way, Data Center Switching was in the mid-teens growth.\nCustomers are investing in these private data centers and collaboration being positive, security being high single digits on the order side, it was, you know, but we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we'd seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars. We didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question on the billion dollars of AI, it is largely driven by the web scale infrastructure. As I said, we've got three out of four that are running our AI Ethernet Fabric, and we also had two or three more design wins during the quarter, I believe in the back end networks inside these web scale players. It's predominantly that, however, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize as I said last quarter.\nThat's really what it's made up of, and it is both systems as well as optics across those customers.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Amit. Operator, can we move to the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next caller is Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director of Data Infrastructure, Raymond James Financial\n\nGreat. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to see if you could give us some metrics or some help trying to extrapolate the 5,000 customer opportunity for Splunk. Just give us a better idea of what that could mean from a dollar's perspective if you're able to penetrate it. My follow up is really, I'm trying to seek a little bit more clarification on this $1 billion AI pipeline because there's been a lot of debate in the investment community regarding it. I want to see if we can get some clarification that when we talk about the context of what's in there, it's exciting explicitly in the back end that there's not some extrapolation to front end data center applications. Explicitly back end.\nI think, Chuck, you are saying that it is mostly switching in the back end with some optics and some Silicon One. I really would like to clarify this because we're getting a lot of questions. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right, let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind, since I just. It's a billion dollars of orders that we have line of sight to in next fiscal year is what I had said. On one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly three times that that we, that we see. We believe we have good visibility to a billion dollars in orders in FY 2025 that is primarily back end. It is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some standalone Silicon One, but mostly systems, and then optics as well. We're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back end in the, in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have.\nCisco has super strong relationships, and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers. We've now mapped those to the sales teams. Gary, you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply.\n\nGary Steele\n\nPresident of Go-to-Market, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. We're excited about the fact that basically we've identified these 5,000 customers where Splunk traditionally has had no footprint. The goal there is to have the Cisco sellers open the door for the Splunk team. There's also a financial incentive or SPIFF in place to incent the Cisco sellers to support this activity. That's really one aspect of where we see tremendous opportunity. Second to that, obviously there's a lot of overlap in our customers where the Cisco team may have higher, more strategic relationships where they can extend our footprint, assisting, helping extend our footprint within the existing Splunk base. We're already seeing that activity right out of the gate. We feel like we're off to a very good start, and I'm super encouraged by the level of collaboration we've seen so far.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Simon. Operator, can we move to the next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next caller is Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, guys. I'm going to ask my two questions also. Together they're linked. You have great motions in security with lots of new products, and you have Splunk introduction to the channel, and you have also the AI opportunity for Ethernet. Can you give us a sense of timing, meaning how long security grew again, only 3% ex Splunk, and how long does it take to get all the benefits that you're talking about in these three main areas or in general? Is it something we're going to see early in 2025 or later in 2025 or 2026? If you can give just a sense of timing of all these initiatives? The second part is related to it.\nIf I remove Splunk from the numbers, and you gave us enough data to completely remove Splunk from 2024, and I can take consensus for 2025, then your core Cisco, meaning your initial growth expectations for 2025, is about 5%, because we need to remove also the backlog contribution this year. So Cisco ex-backlog contribution should grow 5%. It's higher than before. The question is, are you comfortable with Cisco growing 5% next year, give or take, and what is the main component of this growth? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nFor the question. Let's go with the first question. I'll say on the organic Cisco security front, you're right. Revenue was up 3%, but as I said, our demand was the highest it's been in probably a couple of years, and it was high single digits. We're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new, customers are testing, they're implementing, and by the way, a lot of it is ratable. You don't.\nYou take the orders and then you know, like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable. That actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. That's on the security side. I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit, and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. We announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front, even before Splunk, that we had brought in a new team. We've been building new innovation. The team has built five new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months. As you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job.\nI had always said that second half of 2024, I expected you would see an improvement. In 2025 you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. I think that still stands. You want to comment on the Cisco integration stuff, Gary?\n\nGary Steele\n\nPresident of Go-to-Market, Cisco Systems\n\nYou bet. One of the things I'm super excited about is the progress we've made from an integration standpoint. Last week at RSA, for example, we announced the integration between the Cisco XDR solution and Splunk's Enterprise Security solution. Bringing high telemetry alerts into Splunk Enterprise Security gives a Splunk customer that much more value in terms of threat detection. This is just the start of the elements of integration that we can deliver that will ultimately drive growth for the security portfolio broadly, but also Splunk. As we've described earlier, our integration strategy really is a strong ground game, meaning we want to move the ball 3 yards at a time. We're going to demonstrate to the industry that we can continue to innovate at a rapid pace as a combined business.\nWe feel like we're on a really good track to do that.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Gary. On your AI timing question in 2025, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year and it'll ramp as we get through the year. I'll be thinking more back half, but we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a little more about it. We'll know more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because 2025 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of this supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventory shipments and everything.\nTwenty-six over twenty-five will be the year where we'll really hopefully get back to real apples to apples year-over-year comparisons. While we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY 2025 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an analyst day in June, and we'll go into more detail there. Scott, do you have anything to add to that or is that good?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, I think you said it right. Tal, the fact that you've recognized the backlog work off, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco. When you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal 2025, bear in mind too, you know, obviously Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember, we had those three consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid to upper teens, Q3 of 2023 that we're comparing to now, Q4, and then Q1 of this year. In addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter, and again a tough compare in Q1 of 2025.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Tal. Operator, can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe Scott, I want to follow up on that line of questioning from Tal. I recognize that you have that backlog headwind in 2024, but if I just kind of run through what Splunk should be doing versus what they contributed this year, it certainly looks like the backlog headwind is going to cause Core Cisco to be down next year. I know you said you're going to hold off on giving numbers. Is that the right math? Basically, all of the low single to mid single digit growth comes from Splunk. From a gross margin perspective, obviously Splunk is going to be a much bigger part of the business.\nCan you maybe walk through, you gave us an operating margin framework, but sort of what do you expect from a gross margin perspective given the strong gross margin profile of Splunk being a bigger part of the business next year versus this year? Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYes, thanks. David, you remember Q4, Q1 of this current fiscal year, of fiscal 2024, was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it, excess backlog. Right, there's always an ambient level of backlog, but we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. When you think about the growth rate from 2024 to 2025, clearly Splunk is a positive on that, obviously adding that to it. You also have to think of this year, fiscal 2024, having a non-repeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter this year. Remember, first quarter this year we grew in the mid-teens on revenue.\nIf you net that out, and that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid single digits in fiscal 2025, we can walk through. I know that's a lot of moving parts there, David. We can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit. Of course, we had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer term. I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5% to 67.5% range. For Q4, I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal 2025 as well.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, David. Operator, can move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe first question, Chuck, if you could just kind of update where your kind of conversations with customers are around AI, either in kind of desire to invest on premise or invest in kind of Cisco Security products for preparedness, or just impact of budgets. Then maybe second question for Scott. Just as we think about kind of the OpEx investment that you guys noted for Splunk, how should we think of that versus kind of original targets to have Splunk be kind of accretive one year post close. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Mita. I would say the conversations, I think the web scalers is pretty well understood. I'll talk about the enterprise, and I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots, that are doing some work today. We actually have had some, we had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI buildouts. I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our Global Customer Advisory Board last week in Canada, and I think we had about 60 customers there, and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side.\nSorry, did you want to add something, Gary? Go ahead, Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nIn terms of the way to think about the OpEx comment that I made, you know, we talked, Mita, when we announced the acquisition of Splunk, that this is much more driven by revenue synergies than cost synergies. There's no question there will be cost synergies as we work our way through this. We will spend fiscal 2025 from this point through fiscal 2025 ensuring that we get both the product integration right, the organizational integration right. We have to do channel enablement. We have to train their sales team on Cisco, train the Cisco sales team on Splunk. There's investment that goes along with that integration. Fiscal 2025 is the year we'll do that. We said in the first year post acquisition that we would be accretive in cash flow, and we will.\nThat will be accretive in gross margin from Splunk, and we will. That will be accretive in earnings per share in the second year. Think of that as fiscal 2026. I know this closed a little bit early, and I think there's this perception that it closed, you know, six months early, so those times ought to be accelerated. We thought the acquisition would close around the end of our fourth quarter. It closed around the middle of our third quarter. Round numbers, it was a little more than a quarter early. I think the way to think about that is EPS accretive in fiscal 2026, but still being cash flow and gross margin accretive in fiscal 2025 as we invest in the integration.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Meta. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\n\nJames Fish\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nHey guys, did want to double click on Meta's question here because it's a serious ramp on the OpEx side to get really earnings going down again in 2025 if my math is right, somewhere around $3.50 a share. Can you elaborate a little bit further as to why it's going to go be that much? Do we. Should we be expecting revenue synergies starting in fiscal 2025 with that initial kind of low to mid single digit growth rate? Or is that just going to take too much time, another year or so to really get. Just not to layer on the question here, but is some of the OpEx ramp due to the conversion of stock-based comp of Splunk to cash comp because historically Splunk and Cisco have had two totally different philosophies on compensation.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks James.\nOn the OpEx ramp, I mean, it's, you know, I know we haven't. The Splunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their OpEx was headed and layer that into the OpEx that we had had. There is some growth year-on-year, there's some investment. It's not a substantial ramp up, though, in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies, they're likely to come more in the second half of the year. This wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies, it was much more motivated by revenue synergies. I think you will. What you said, I think, is spot on.\nWe will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal 2025, as these are not short sales cycles. As we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk, as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco, and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. Yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year.\n\nGary Steele\n\nPresident of Go-to-Market, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, I think the revenue synergies that we're focused on really are driven around the 5,000 accounts that we talked about earlier. The sales cycles on those are six to nine months. You're not going to see that immediately, but that work is happening, and we're also seeing tremendous collaboration across the organization, where sales teams are working together to more broadly penetrate accounts. I think you start to see that in the first half, but it's going to layer in. You're going to see more momentum as we get to the middle part of the year.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, James. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple as well, if I may. I know you're talking today about the deployments with your customers, enterprise customers, being higher than what you're shipping to. That implies you'll take a step up in terms of revenue when that inventory digestion ends. I was just curious in sort of the order trends you had mentioned. You'll be back to a normal seasonality of orders, maybe more in fiscal 2025, but how close are you seeing sort of order trends return on a sequential or quarterly basis to more normalized sort of seasonal trends? Is that pointing you in any direction in terms of whether that gap between deployment and your orders is starting to sort of compress? For the second one, just a quick follow-up on the AI order, $1 billion sort of target here.\nJust trying to understand if you feel like you need one or two more big wins in terms of customers, or the land and expand with the existing ones should be good enough to get you to that $1 billion target that you have. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nScott. You want to take the sequential one?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, I will. On the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress. Samik, and one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this, is where we see it moving more quickly. We talked about Wi-Fi and how our wireless business is growing, where the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly. We're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates, is a lot tougher. Right. You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter, which we're headed toward now. Once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter, and then you have to lap it by a year to get to a year-on-year compare. That's an apples-to-apples to compare, compare.\nThink of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal 2026. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal 2025.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. On the AI, the billion dollars, the billion dollars that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence in. This is not like we didn't set a billion dollar target and tell people to go find deals. There are deals behind the billion, and there are actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and whenever we get it. When we get them done, we have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. A lot of that's going on. Based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today.\nThis is not some aspiration that we have to go find. These are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you. Samki, operator. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey guys, thanks so much. One question, one small follow up. I think this has been the theme most of the call on the main question actually for Scott, you've got leverage now that sits just under one turn, but the business now has a greater mix of recurring revenue, more visibility that that naturally lends itself to. I'm just wondering how you think about optimal leverage for the business and uses of excess cash from here. On the follow up, as we think about low to mid singles growth next year, well aware of the backlog and the tougher comp that that creates in fiscal Q1 of next year, just as we unpack the networking assumptions, are you assuming normal demand and purchasing cadence returns next year once inventories have been digested or any incremental caution that's embedded there from a macro perspective? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYou want to take the first one? Yeah. I'll talk about cash first, Matt. Yeah, we moved obviously with the acquisition of Splunk and this data is out there. We raised about $13.5 billion of term debt that's out there, and we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet, but also with commercial paper, with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates. It's a way of saving money on that move to a net debt position.\nFor the first time certainly in my career, probably in the first time here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last two decades here at Cisco, the use of cash though, you know, we talked about Splunk being cash flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction at this size. It will be. Our cap allocation process is not going to change. Just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's support growth, right behind that, if that's one, you know, one A is of course continuing to support the dividend. You see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis, return cash to shareholders through share buybacks. That's been at a steady $1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters.\nWe'll continue to do that, and to the extent that we've met those three, and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever, or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nMatt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize, obviously with the caveat that there's a lot of hotspots around the world. There are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world, and the most important one perhaps in the United States. We're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. So far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY 2025.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Matt. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi there. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin impacts from the inventory digestion. As we look around the space, we've seen companies use tools like stock rotation or rebates to try to push inventory through the channel. Sometimes that can certainly have an impact on margins. Are you guys seeing any of that in the gross margin results right now? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, we're not, George. There's very little inventory in the channel. That is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship it to the channel, it's sold at that point, there's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. We're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher costs that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints, and we've lapped those. There's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out, a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal, what it had been, kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in, and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, George. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Had a question for Gary, I guess out of the press. Palo Alto just announced its acquisition of the SIEM business from IBM. Exabeam this morning announced the merger with LogRhythm. It seems like the market you're operating in is moving at a very fast pace at consolidation. Maybe you can talk about the competitive landscape for your business, and why should we not assume that pricing pressures are going to significantly rise in this environment as everybody's trying to fight for footprint?\n\nGary Steele\n\nPresident of Go-to-Market, Cisco Systems\n\nYes. No, great question. There obviously is a lot of activity in this particular market. One of the things that we feel very good about, and Chuck referenced in his prepared remarks earlier, is our position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant where we stood out as the leader in the SIEM market. We have a very strong, established market position, and our pace of innovation has fundamentally changed over the last couple years. We've continued to deliver very interesting, innovative capability that we think is very high value. For example, last week at RSA we announced what we call Splunk Asset and Risk Intelligence. This is a critical capability to help organizations do self-discovery of assets across their environment, and then understand the risks associated with those things.\nCoupled with that, we're now getting the broad benefit of the Cisco Security product line, where we can bring in interesting capabilities like the integration with the XDR solution that we also announced. We feel like while yes, it is competitive, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned to continue to drive very important innovation. We've also taken a very different approach than our competitors, and we think broadly about how do you bring together on a single platform the security capabilities that customers want broadly, all the way through observability. It's very difficult across the industry to see anybody taking a position that we have and driving value with respect to pricing. We don't have any fundamental change in our pricing strategy. We're very much focused on driving very good adoption across our customer base and ensuring that they feel like they're getting value every day.\nThe capabilities that we're offering are hard to match in the industry. We're not shifting gears from a pricing point of view.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you. Ittai. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research",
    "content2": "Yeah, hi, thanks for the question. In the spirit of the two, I wanted to ask, you know, if we take, you know, let's say $1 to 2 billion of the hit, you know, from inventory in 2025 and from the prior question, I just want to make sure that I heard it right, that do you underwrite that the real industry growth is about or the real networking growth is in that mid single digit range that was mentioned in a prior question. If that's the case, I guess this is the second one, then does it mean at your analyst day we'll hear more about how 2026 could be a higher single digit growth business for Cisco overall.\nI mean you're mixing towards Splunk and software, and therefore the math would therefore have you guys on a normalized basis after, you know, after the organic growth is very muted in 2025, you know, accelerating by several hundred basis points to the higher single digits in 2026. If that's true, be happy to repeat any of this, but hopefully you were able to follow that. Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, yeah, I got it, Ben. You're asking me now for Fiscal 2026 guide at the same time, is that the right takeaway? Just kidding. You're thinking about it right, the underlying business, the core business of Cisco. Net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal 2025, but also when you take 2024, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal 2024, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid single digit growth of the core business that we've had. I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more. I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal 2026 and beyond at our investor day in June in Vegas. Hopefully I'll see you there.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Ben. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Atif Malik with Citi. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nManaging Director and U.S. Semiconductor Capital Equipment and Specialty Semiconductors Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Gary. Gary, Splunk has been using AI/ML for the last year and a half with Natural Language Assistant, STL, and also Event Detection and Response. Can you big picture talk about how Cisco data will improve your AI capabilities?\n\nGary Steele\n\nPresident of Go-to-Market, Cisco Systems\n\nYou bet. If you look at the history with Splunk, we were very early driving capabilities with machine learning. We launched the MLTK package in 2017, and we've had a quarter of a million users on that. There's been broad adoption. We then extended that when we brought GenAI into the picture, delivering an SPL Assistant. SPL being our proprietary search language, being able to use English to be able to do that. We're also bringing AI directly into the workflow. Think about SOAR as an example and how you can bring AI into the picture to drive better outcomes from a remediation point of view. We've been investing across the product line. You're going to hear and see more announcements from us over at Cisco Live, as well as at our user conference, which follows Cisco Live.\nThe benefit that we're getting bringing it into Cisco is Cisco has independently been making a whole set of investments. We get to leverage those assets in addition to the richness of data that we get. Where we benefit from Cisco is the broad, rich data sets that exist across networking, where you, so think lateral movement. How can we leverage that data to do a better job from a detection point of view? Frankly, the data and insights that we have as a combined entity, I think, are second to none in terms of the competitive environment. We just basically accelerate our AI efforts as part of Cisco, and the outcomes we can deliver to be really important.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Atif. Michelle, can we move to the last question? Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMichael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just have two as well. First, you know I think that the guidance this year implies 34% EBIT margins. You know, you commented that fiscal 2025 can look like the guide for fiscal 4Q. I think about a billion dollars of OpEx investments. I was just wondering if you could kind of qualitatively talk about where most of those OpEx investments will lie. Secondly, last quarter you characterized the fiscal 2024 guidance as conservative, I believe. How would you characterize your initial financial outlook for fiscal 2025? Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay, Michael, thanks for the question. The year-on-year again, I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal 2025 look is expectations. If you just added, you know, straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are the run rate of the Splunk spend, I'd say a couple things to bear in mind. There's some one-time benefits that we had this year in our OpEx for the core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, frankly, in our variable comp plans, which, as you know, it's been a tough year and we've come up short of our plan. There's some savings in variable comp for this year in fiscal 2024 that obviously I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal 2025. There is some, and obviously we'll do a merit increase as well.\nThere's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and an ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number that with the quick math that you just did. That's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now, if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say what I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now. Let's just go back. Consumption of all the inventory that we ship to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation.\nWe think we work our way through that headwind mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter. That's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about, and you know, being more second half, but for the full year, second half of fiscal 2025, but for the full year that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it was going to do, right? We've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk, and those products are getting good traction. That's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. I think all in all I feel like it's kind of a down the middle view of fiscal 2025 at this point. It's not a formal guide.\nI just wanted to give you a sense of what that looked like, and we'll give you a better feel for what the longer term looks like at our Investor Day in June. We'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Michael. I now want to hand it over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Sami, and thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY 2025. Feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done as we look to the future. We obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective, as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security in general, we believe, will continue to improve, and obviously we're super excited about the Splunk integration, and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you.\nI also just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco, and also we are very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here, and thank you all for being with us today.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAs a reminder, we will be hosting our 2024 Investor Day as part of Cisco Live on 4 June 2024. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter and full year results, will be on Wednesday, 14 August 2024 at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations Department. We thank you very much for joining the call today.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd thank you.for participating on today's conference call.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis.\nThe matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and certainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please feel free to see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations, and allowed us to deliver better than anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases. We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter.\nOur pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions, and generating higher levels of ARR, with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing, and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecasts and expectations.\nSecond, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure, and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook. Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress.\nHowever, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are one to two quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months.\nOur team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that non-hardware-centric revenue in areas such as security, collaboration, and our observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable, and on a rolling four-quarter basis, our market share remains steady in three of our four largest markets. Now, moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us, and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities.\nWith our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner. As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services, so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco Networking Cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our security, collaboration, and observability portfolios, leveraging AI throughout. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with NVIDIA to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based, and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads.\nWe are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel, with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure. In web scale, we continue to see momentum, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads. In security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions.\nThis quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks, which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI assistant in Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall, with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next six months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments. In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access, joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst, and Meraki platforms.\nThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications, and things through billions of daily measurements of the internet and public SaaS, as well as thousands of enterprise customers creating best-in-class digital experiences for users. In observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications, and efficient resolution of session-level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most: minimizing tool sprawl, improving overall performance, and delivering highly secure digital experiences. Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours in AI, security, and observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency.\nWe are excited that together we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine, and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize three key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year, given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory, and ongoing weakness in service provider.\nSecond, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us, and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders, and industry-leading innovation for our customers. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again, with strong margins, and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue is at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9%, and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless, and routed optical networking, driven primarily by weakness in the enterprise, service provider, and cloud markets. Security was up 3%, with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling, partially offset by a decline in meetings.\nObservability was up 16%, driven by growth across the portfolio, with continued strength in ThousandEyes Network Services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere: on-premise, internet, and the cloud. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6%, with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. Total short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%.\nQ2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1, as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8%, and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was down 40%, enterprise was down 6%, and public sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7%, up 280 basis points year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs, and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points.\nNon-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage. Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce, with estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $800 million. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million, driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and $1.3 billion of share repurchases.\nYear to date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, and we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. Given the confidence we have in our business, today we announced we are raising our dividend by one penny to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue.\nWe are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it'll close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance. Turning to our guidance, as previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they've received from us, and the weakness of our service provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion.\nWe anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYep. Good afternoon. I'll ask both my questions up front. You know, Chuck, when I think about the low revenue guide for the full year, about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago, can you spec out how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? How do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically? As a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this NVIDIA announcement before CAD. There's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flesh that out, what that means for Cisco. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nAmit, thank you very much. Obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talked to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. What we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. That's the difference that we've seen. As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of the three, including the digestion issue, as well as the telco and SP piece, I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly.\nHowever, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be—we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that, you know, the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in 2025 they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true. I think that the consumption issue and the SP thing, or the consumption issue, is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see, and the SP telco probably similarly. All of these things led us, obviously, to reset the second half of the year. On the NVIDIA partnership, it is definitely Ethernet.\nI was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there will be multiple versions of this over time. It will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Amit. Michelle, we have the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe, you know, you've mentioned service provider, but I guess just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge, or if it comes to kind of the five investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago, you know, are any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? Maybe as a second question, you know, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, Meta. I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see observability, as you saw, the 16% growth rate. We even saw collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They're at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses. We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. We see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both observability opportunities, as well as, you know, the rearchitecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years.\nI think the real issue right now is that we ship so much networking in our core business that that's where the challenge is, that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now. As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I will tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise begin to emerge. There's heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise.\nI think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to expend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. That's about what I could tell you at this point.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you. Meta, Michelle, can we go to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck, and maybe for Scott also. You know, if I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal 2019 revenue levels. I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of, you know, that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as sort of investor, as sort of customers digest product. You know, obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio given some of the other parts of the business have grown. I just want to kind of try to get a sense for how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal 2019.\nFrom a profitability standpoint, you know, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. Is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by, you know, a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, David, I'll start, then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. Since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders, and then a, you know, subsequent big building up of our backlog. As we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. It's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as, you know, as all those dynamics were going on. What we're seeing now is, as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream.\nI don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to a historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? At this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed. I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? We can get back to regular ordering, and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go four quarters out to be able to compare to a more normalized point.\nI think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. There's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the last published reports that came out after Q.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThree calendar.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nCalendar Q3, in our four largest markets, if you take campus switching, you take wireless, and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss.\nTo be, we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their web scale sales into data center switching, and we report our web scale sales into SP routing. Those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. The others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling four quarter over, even over the last three years.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, David. Michelle, next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director of Data Infrastructure, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one, then ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. Orders this quarter down 12%, not too bad. I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend. The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the web scale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster, or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers, or will they mix and match? How do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity?\nI really mean this more longer term, 2025, 2026, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, Simon. On the order trajectory, I think what we clearly don't guide bookings, but what I would tell you is that even as our teams modify their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. Your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid. I'll leave it at that. On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of web scale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology under GPUs. I think it's important to remember they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want two sources. We're both actually, the two of us are actually playing in the space today. I'd say today they're completely homogenous clusters.\nI think it's too early to tell whether there'll be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is unless there's something that changes significantly, or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point, I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Simon. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director of Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. I have two questions. The first one is security. The market is great. You know, we met two years ago and three years ago, and you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there, and what can you do to fix security and benefit from this market growth? Maybe I'll ask my follow-up.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tal. I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year we would start to see an acceleration of security. I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that, some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR, Secure Access, Multicloud Defense, the suites, we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies. XDR, we announced that in April of last year. We shipped it in August, and we have 230 customers, 230+ customers on the platform today. The important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. We actually typically see that as a six to nine month sales cycle. To have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing.\nThat's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. We see, we feel good about the pipeline. From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. If you just watch over the next six to nine months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same timeframe.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Tal. We'll get to your other question at some point after the call. Michelle, can we move to the next speaker?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I'm going to, for my first question, ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. What I'm hearing from you today is, even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal 2024, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand. Are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal 2025? If you can share what you're seeing from customers there.\nFor my follow-up, the NVIDIA partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order target of $1 billion, or is it really most of that partnership materializes beyond that sort of target window, target timeframe? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks. I would say the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicate, we asked them point blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter? We heard more, a little bit more. We saw the push out of the forecast. That just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. Therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal 2025. On the NVIDIA discussion, a couple of comments.\nWe talked about the billion dollars of orders, which I know someone's going to ask me about at some point. What I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continued to grow. The pipeline is now almost three times that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in 2025. The total pipeline is now about three times that, roughly three times that. I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the NVIDIA partnership yet. It's all independent of that.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzus with Melius Research, you may go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks for the question, guys. Hey, Chuck. Hey, Scott. Wanted to ask about the HPE Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term, how do you think that helps you long term? If you, Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, one of your competitors obviously is expecting quite a big pickup next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year, or what's your timing on that? Thanks so much.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ben. I would say on the HPE Juniper deal, you know, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless. I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in million dollar plus wireless deals sequentially. It's hard to say, but I mean, there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. I think it's a little early for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us. On the timing, yeah, I think, you know, we said fiscal 2025, which starts in August of this year.\nI think you probably should assume most of that's probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Ben, our expectation is the majority of that billion dollars in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal 2025, just to be clear.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Ben. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks so much. I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. Main question just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? Can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year end? Follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. I'm just wondering, you know, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds, or has anything changed on the supply chain front? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. I'll take the first, and then Scott, you can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's, I would say it's largely an enterprise and a service provider issue, particularly the cloud providers. We think they've got probably in excess of 20+ weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up, you know, when the lead times were so long. We have a lot of our enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud from management perspectives, so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connect it. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks, so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio how the timeframe between shipments and connectivity is shrinking.\nIt's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of 2024. That's where we are. Scott, gross margins?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics, but to your question on where does this settle in, I think it settles in in the range we're in right now, in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's, you know, both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly. We continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there.\nThe scale of the services ramp up, as you know, obviously services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those three really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. Since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. I think when you add all those together, we should settle in the 66% to 67% range. The majority of, if not all of, the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Matt. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question, Chuck and Scott. I just have two. First, just on the, you know, the revenue guidance, I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal Q4 revenue guidance only implies about, you know, +1% quarter on quarter. You know, given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? As a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the NVIDIA AI deal, I just want to clarify, you know, I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both NVIDIA's, you know, Spectrum X as well as Cisco's Ethernet, and how will that be sold together if that's the correct assumption? Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nMichael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. As Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOn the NVIDIA front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go-to-market, our global ecosystem, and partner community. Therefore, when these solutions are flowing through our channels, our sales teams, and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Michael. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I'm just curious about, you know, are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating, stock rotation? You know, how are you taking an active approach here? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI'll comment. I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. I know that our sales teams were talking this week. Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, we absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both, sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were pre-pandemic. We're not seeing any of that, any pressure on that front.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, George. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence, you may go ahead.\n\nWoo Jin Ho\n\nSenior Analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. Given that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rate? You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, I'm curious where that's heading going forward.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. I think, thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is we've put a, as you can imagine, when you've built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success, and driving adoption, and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly. You know, when you look at where we're more software heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we recorded growth, revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. We are seeing that actually trend in the right direction.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Woo Jin. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tim Long with Barclays, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Yeah, one question, one follow-up. First, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit, excuse me, about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the headcount reduction, obviously protecting margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? Just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with, you know, from a product standpoint? Are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or, you know, the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, Tim. On the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that. We're very disciplined, though, and, you know, we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see in your technology and what you deliver. If you look at a lot of our competitors and you look at some of the market share, I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. While we always look at margins versus growth, we're just disciplined across both. On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now.\nWe've got the Ethernet running in three of the four big ones, and we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time. We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms, so it's evolving, but we have, you know, I tell our teams, unlike the original cloud transition that we've talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world, I think we are absolutely ready and well-equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Tim. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'll stick to one. Just building on that last question, I know over a period of time you've talked a little bit about how large your web scale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the web scale opportunities, either from a size and maybe, you know, maybe X the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, you know, particularly with those web scale customers right now?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOur team measures what their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it. There are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the web scale players. Scott, keep me honest. I want to say we're designed into 16 or 21?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\n21.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\n21 of those. That's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they would not be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. They're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. I don't think that's, it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases, and as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. You know, in the traditional days with carriers, they wanted two vendors who would provide two different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon. They look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nAaron, the only thing I'd add is, and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a, you know, a complete box, a white box, and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is the tailwind for us longer term.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Aaron. Michelle, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. James Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Fish\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Scott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins, just wondering, with supply chains starting to go the other way and supply more readily available, could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? Any sense to, you know, how should we think about, you know, the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and difficulty, and, you know, what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on headcount? Thanks, guys.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. On the price declines, you got to remember to go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. That was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints, and, you know, supply demand's pretty straightforward. What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down, memory is a good example, but what we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. With that, you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. I'm not anticipating at this point price declines pending, you know, significant cost declines coming into us.\nOn the cost savings, you know, you can see where we are year to date. We've got a, if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year to date, operating expenses are modestly up. After working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco",
    "content2": "Thank you, James. The next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 15 2024 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Cisco Investor Relations. We thank you very much for joining the call today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 800-876-5258. For participants dialing from outside the US, please dial 203-369-3998. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time. Welcome to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis.\nThe matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and certainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please feel free to see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better than anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases. We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter.\nOur pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions, and generating higher levels of ARR, with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing, and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world. Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecasts and expectations.\nSecond, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure, and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook. Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress.\nHowever, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are one to two quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months.\nOur team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that non-hardware-centric revenue in areas such as security, collaboration, and our observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable, and on a rolling four-quarter basis, our market share remains steady in three of our four largest markets. Now, moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with, or better than, our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us, and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities.\nWith our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner. As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services, so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco Networking Cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our security, collaboration, and observability portfolios, leveraging AI throughout. We also continue to capitalize on the multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with NVIDIA to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based, and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads.\nWe are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel, with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure. In web scale, we continue to see momentum, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads. In security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions.\nThis quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks, which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI assistant in Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall, with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next six months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments. In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access, joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst, and Meraki platforms.\nThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications, and things through billions of daily measurements of the internet and public SaaS, as well as thousands of enterprise customers creating best-in-class digital experiences for users. In observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications, and efficient resolution of session-level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most: minimizing tool sprawl, improving overall performance, and delivering highly secure digital experiences. Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours in AI, security, and observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency.\nWe are excited that together we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine, and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter. Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize three key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory, and ongoing weakness in service provider.\nSecond, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us, and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders, and industry-leading innovation for our customers. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again, with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue is at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9%, and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless, and routed optical networking, driven primarily by weakness in the enterprise, service provider, and cloud markets. Security was up 3%, with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling, partially offset by a decline in meetings.\nObservability was up 16%, driven by growth across the portfolio, with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere: on-premise, internet, and the cloud. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6%, with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. Total short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%.\nQ2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1, as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8%, and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was down 40%, enterprise was down 6%, and public sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7%, up 280 basis points year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs, and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points.\nNon-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage. Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce, with estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $800 million. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million, driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and $1.3 billion of share repurchases.\nYear to date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, and we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by one penny to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue.\nWe are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it'll close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance. Turning to our guidance, as previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they've received from us, and the weakness of our service provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion.\nWe anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGood afternoon. I'll ask both my questions up front. You know, Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year, about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago, can you specify how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? How do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically? As a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this NVIDIA announcement before Chad. There's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flesh that out, what that means for Cisco. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThank you very much. Obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talked to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. What we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. That's the difference that we've seen. As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of the three, including the digestion issue, as well as the telco and SP piece, I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly.\nHowever, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory level should be—we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in 2025 they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true. I think that the consumption issue and the SP thing, or the consumption issue, is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see, and the SP telco probably similarly. All of these things will let us, obviously, reset the second half of the year. On the NVIDIA partnership, it is definitely Ethernet.\nI was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs, creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. It will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Amit. Michelle, we have the next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe you've mentioned service provider, but I guess just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge, or if it comes to kind of the five investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago, are any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly. Just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from. Just any commentary would be helpful there. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, Meta. I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see observability, as you saw, the 16% growth rate. We even saw collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They're at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses. We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. We see a lot of that. We see customers continue to invest in their application re-architecture, which leads to both observability opportunities, as well as the re-architecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years.\nI think the real issue right now is that we ship so much networking in our core business that that's where the challenge is, that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now. As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I will tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise begin to emerge. There's heavy work going on in financial services. I would say that it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise.\nI think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to expend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. That's about what I could tell you at this point.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you. Meta, Michelle, can we go to the next analyst?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck, and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal 2019 revenue levels. I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as sort of customers digest product. Obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio given some of the other parts of the business have grown. I just want to kind of try to get a sense for how you're thinking about the portfolio today given we're kind of back to fiscal 2019.\nFrom a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. Is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, David, I'll start, and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. Since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders, and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog. As we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue, so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on. What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream.\nI don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to a historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? At this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed. I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? We can get back to regular ordering, and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go four quarters out to be able to compare to a more normalized point.\nI think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. There's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. David, on the share loss, I think if you just look at the last published reports that came out after Q.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThree calendar.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nCalendar Q3, in our four largest markets, if you take campus switching, you take wireless, and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. To be clear, we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their web scale sales into data center switching, and we report our web scale sales into SP routing. Those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. The others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling four quarter, even over the last three years.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, David. Michelle, next analyst.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director of Data Infrastructure, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and then ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. Orders this quarter down 12%, not too bad. I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again given the comparison and the trend. The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the web scale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster, or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers, or will they mix and match? How do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity?\nI really mean this more longer term, 2025, 2026, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, Simon. On the order trajectory, I think we clearly don't guide bookings, but what I would tell you is that even as our teams modify their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. Your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that. On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of web scale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology under GPUs. I think it's important to remember they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want two sources. We're both actually, the two of us are actually playing in the space today. I'd say today they're completely homogenous clusters.\nI think it's too early to tell whether there'll be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is unless there's something that changes significantly, or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point, I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Simon. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director of Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. I have two questions. The first one is security. The market is great, we met two years ago and three years ago, and you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there, and what can you do to fix security and benefit from this market growth? Maybe I'll ask my follow-up.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tal. I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year we would start to see an acceleration of security. I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that, some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR, Secure Access, Multicloud Defense, the suites, we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies. XDR, we announced that in April of last year. We shipped it in August, and we have 230 customers, 230+ customers on the platform today. The important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. We actually typically see that as a six to nine-month sales cycle. To have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing.\nThat's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. We see, we feel good about the pipeline. From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. If you just watch over the next six to nine months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Tal. We'll get to your other question at some point after the call. Michelle, can we move to the next speaker?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, I'm going to, for my first question, ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. What I'm hearing from you today is, even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal 2024, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand. Are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal 2025? If you can share what you're seeing from customers there.\nFor my follow-up, the NVIDIA partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order target of $1 billion, or is it really most of that partnership materializes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks. I would say on the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicate we asked them point blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter? We heard more, a little bit more. We saw the push out of the forecast. That just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. Therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal 2025. On the NVIDIA discussion, a couple of comments.\nWe talked about the billion dollars of orders, which I know someone's going to ask me about at some point. What I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continued to grow. The pipeline is now almost three times that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in 2025. The total pipeline is now about three times that, roughly three times that. I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the NVIDIA partnership yet. It's all independent of that.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Samik. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research, you may go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks for the question, guys. Hey, Chuck. Hey, Scott. Wanted to ask about the HPE Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term, and how do you think that helps you long term? Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, one of your competitors obviously is expecting quite a big pickup next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year, or what's your timing on that? Thanks so much.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ben. I would say on the HPE Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless. I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in million-dollar-plus wireless deals sequentially. It's hard to say. I mean, there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. I think it's a little early for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us. On the timing, I think we said fiscal 2025, which starts in August of this year.\nI think you probably should assume most of that's probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Ben, our expectation is the majority of that billion dollars in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal 2025, just to be clear.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThank you, Ben. Michelle, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks so much. I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. Main question just around inventory digestion. Is that."

Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter, Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter, Fiscal Year 2024 Quarterly Conference Call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's new Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. Having followed Cisco on the sell side for 10 years, I couldn't be more excited to join the company, and I look forward to engaging with you all in my new role. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.\nAs a reminder, we have simplified how we report product and service revenue and customer markets. Starting this quarter, we are reporting revenue in the following five categories: networking, security, collaboration, observability, and services.\nWe are reporting customer markets in the following three categories: enterprise, public sector and service provider, and cloud. Also, as is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the Q2 and full year of fiscal 2024.\nThey are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Sami, and welcome to Cisco. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered a solid start to fiscal 2024 with the strongest Q1 results in Cisco's history in terms of revenue and profitability. Our Q1 revenue was at the upper end of our guided range. EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strength in gross margins and expense control, resulting in strong operating leverage. Our disciplined expense management and the tailwinds from our business model transformation resulted in our highest non-GAAP gross margin in over 17 years and a record non-GAAP operating margin.\nWe also returned $2.8 billion in Q1 via cash dividends and share repurchases, delivering on our capital return commitments to our shareholders.\nAs we continue to transform our business towards more software and recurring revenue streams, fueled by accelerated innovation, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and shareholder returns. Now, turning to the demand environment. After three quarters of exceptionally strong product delivery, our customers are now focused on installing and implementing these unprecedented levels of products. The bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners.\nOur order lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. As deliveries rose, the channel inventory we track at our distributors also steadily declined during this time. Simply put, customers are now taking time to onboard and deploy these heightened product deliveries. While the macro challenges we have discussed still exist, we believe this implementation phase is the primary reason for the slowdown in new orders.\nWe saw it mostly with our larger enterprise, service provider, and cloud customers, and it was most pronounced in October. Based on our analysis, we believe this phase is temporary and estimate there is an additional one to two quarters' worth of shipped orders in customers' hands still waiting to be deployed. This has near-term consequences for revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters, which Scott will discuss shortly. However, it does not change our longer-term confidence.\nWe expect product order growth rates to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. We also remain very confident in the foundational strength of our business and future growth opportunities, given the criticality of our technologies. Overall, our win rates are stable.\nCancellation and return rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and we have gained market share, all of which are testaments to the strength of our portfolio and how it aligns with our customers' most pressing needs. As we look to enhance our capabilities in higher-growth areas, in Q1 of fiscal 2024, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency with our complementary capabilities in AI, security, and observability.\nThe combination of Cisco and Splunk also directly supports our strategic objectives around driving higher levels of growth, software capabilities, and ARR. Together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine, and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions. Now, let me comment on our quarterly performance.\nAs I previously mentioned, we delivered strong revenues in Q1, which were broad-based across our product portfolio and driven by our customers' investments in generative AI, cloud, security, and full-stack observability. As expected, we continue to gain market share with the release of the calendar Q2 results, recording another quarter of year-over-year gains in three of our largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing. In web scale, we see continued momentum in AI, with three of the top four customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric.\nWe also already have a line of sight to over $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal year 2025. To help advance AI, we are working with key GPU and storage partners to create solutions, including Ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and joint tested and validated reference architectures, with a commitment to open networking for AI.\nCollectively, we believe there is a great opportunity for a broad set of innovations in compute, GPU, networking, software, and services to support core and edge AI infrastructure. According to the 650 Group, the AI switching market is forecasted to exceed $10 billion in 2027. Our scalable fabric for AI, coupled with the proven power-saving capabilities of Cisco Silicon One, put us in a strong position to build out the infrastructure needed for AI clusters, and we are laser-focused on winning in this space. Moving to security, we continue to execute against our product roadmap and strengthen our unified security platform.\nSince our Cisco XDR solution became available this summer, we have added recovery to the response process, giving security teams the ability to snapshot and restore their business-critical data at the first sign of a ransomware attack.\nWith our three new offers around XDR, Cisco Secure Access, and multi-cloud defense, we already have over $500 million in the pipeline across over 1,000 customers. We also launched our new Cisco security firewall solution this quarter. We are actively engaged in competitive sales with all these products and expect to see meaningful, positive results in the coming quarters. In our collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced a range of truly game-changing AI capabilities spanning the entire Webex Suite, as well as new devices for reimagined workspaces at our WebexOne event.\nBefore I turn it over to Scott, let me briefly summarize three key takeaways. First, as we consider where we're at today, the primary issue with demand is that customers are taking time to onboard and deploy heightened product deliveries.\nWhile we are not immune to the macro, we believe this is temporary, as our customers and partners continue to tell us that our portfolio is stronger than ever, and we have continued to see share gains in key markets. Second, we remain confident in our future. With the incremental multi-billion dollar AI infrastructure opportunity, the increasing criticality of security, observability, and what we believe Cisco and Splunk can do together for our customers is truly exciting. Lastly, you can always count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation, and expense management.\nI'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered solid results in Q1, driven by the prior strategic actions we took to mitigate the supply chain constraints. For the quarter, we reported strong revenue growth and a record non-GAAP operating margin. Total revenue was $14.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.5 billion, up 28%. The non-GAAP EPS was $1.11, up 29%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 9%, and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 4%.\nNetworking, our largest product category, drove the increase with 10% growth. Within networking, the growth was driven by switching, where campus and data center were both up double digits on the strength of our Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 offerings. This was partially offset by a decline in wireless.\nSecurity was up 4%, driven by our zero-trust and threat intelligence detection and response offerings. Collaboration was up 3%, driven by growth in calling and contact center, partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 21%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress in our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings and saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.5 billion, which increased 5%, with product ARR growth of 10%.\nTotal software revenue was $4.4 billion, a 13% increase, with software subscription revenue also up 13%. Eighty-five percent of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue increased 10% to $6.5 billion, which represents 44% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of one percentage point over last year. RPO was $34.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product RPO increased 14%, and service RPO increased 11%.\nTotal short-term RPO was up 8% to $17.6 billion. Looking at our product orders by geographic segment year-over-year, overall product orders declined 20%, with the Americas down 19%, EMEA down 13%, and APJC down 38%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud were down 38%, enterprise was down 26%, and public sector was up slightly at 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.1%, up 410 basis points year-over-year, and 110 basis points above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.5%, up 550 basis points.\nThe increase was driven primarily by productivity improvements with lower freight, logistics, and component costs. A favorable mix and positive pricing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Services' non-GAAP gross margin was 69%, up slightly. Our non-GAAP operating margin came in at 36.6%, up 480 basis points, and exceeding the high end of our guidance range.\nThis improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing disciplined cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.5 billion. We had operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.4 billion, down 40%, primarily due to the $2.8 billion tax payment related to prior quarters, which was associated with the IRS tax relief due to the California floods. This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases.\nConsistent with our cap allocation strategy, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline.\nDuring Q1, we announced our intent to acquire Splunk, which we expect to close by the end of Q3 of calendar year 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including approval by Splunk shareholders. In Q1, we also closed several acquisitions, all of which are highly complementary to our internal R&D and align with our strategy to strengthen our position in cloud, security, observability, and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter, highlighted by top-line growth and increased operating leverage that resulted in stronger-than-anticipated earnings per share.\nWe continue to make progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We remain focused on discipline expense management, without losing sight of the strategic investments necessary to innovate and capitalize on growth opportunities.\nTurning to our financial guidance, as Chuck outlined, the bottleneck that we previously saw in the supply chain has now shifted downstream to implementation by our customers and partners. Most of the supply chain constraints are now behind us, and both shipment lead times and backlog have largely returned to normal levels. Q1 product orders declined 20% as our largest customers are implementing elevated levels of product shipments from prior quarters, as we delivered orders from our historically high backlog levels.\nAs Chuck mentioned, we believe there are one to two quarters' worth of shipped orders awaiting implementation by our customers. Our revenue guidance assumes one to two quarters of lower revenue, and then a return to more typical sequential growth rates. Consequently, for Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $12.6 to 12.8 billion.\nWe anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82 to 0.84. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is updated as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.8 billion to 55 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.87 to 3.93. In both our Q2 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%.\nI'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution this quarter. We remain confident in the strength of the business, and our ability to capitalize on the key growth opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it back to Sami so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up for questions.\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead, sir.\nTal, are you there?\n\nTal Liani\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, sorry. I was on mute. Now you can hear me.\n\nOperator\n\nThat's good.\n\nTal Liani\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nWhat is your assumption on the growth seasonality after the next quarter? Are we back to your assumptions to normal seasonality, or do you expect kind of different seasonality than in previous years?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Tal, it's a great question. As I said, when we talked about one to two quarters of basically inventory, but shipped product that's at our customers that's not yet been installed, I expect the impact to be greatest in Q2 and Q3. When you look at order growth, we do see a return to order growth in the second half of the year, both sequentially and year-on-year, as we get there.\n\nTal Liani\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nIn terms of revenue recognition, you expect Q2 to Q3 sequentials? That was my question. Do you expect Q2 to be weaker than the previous seasonality, or do you expect it to be the same as the previous seasonality?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nNo, from a revenue standpoint [crosstalk], we don't guide bookings, Tal, but from a revenue standpoint, I do see a sequential increase from Q2 to Q3.\n\nTal Liani\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, thank you, Tal.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Phil.\n\nOperator\n\nMichelle, next question.\nNina Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead.\n\nNina Marshall\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Maybe just a question on if you see the investment categories kind of changing, maybe pre the orders that you've seen, and then when you see them come back in a couple of quarters. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how many of the orders we've seen over the last year have been catch-up investments like campus and data center, and then areas of investment will change as we come back, or is this really just inventory digestion, and the investment categories and kind of investment prioritization will stay the same with customers? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Amit, thanks for the question. I think your latter comment is probably the closest to the truth. We don't anticipate a big difference, although I think with the improvements that we've seen in our portfolio in security, we should see security accelerate. Obviously, we'll continue to update you on the AI opportunity that's out there. We think that's going to continue to be a driver over the next couple of years. In general, I think it'll look more normal once we get through this.\n\nNina Marshall\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Nina. Michelle, next question.\nAmit Daryanani with Evercore, you may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Chuck, one of the things I think folks will struggle to understand is the conviction you have that this is an implementation pause and not a macro demand-centric weakness. I'd love to just understand whatever you can talk about and why you're so convinced this is a one to two-quarter implementation pause rather than enterprise demand is just getting weaker. Anything on that front would be helpful. I just want to clarify this part. You folks said a billion dollars in AI orders. That's two times the number you gave last time. Is that correct? Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Amit, thank you. If you'll be patient with me, I'll give you a few data points and some context around why we think this is an inventory issue that's sitting with our customers. First of all, our customers and our sales organizations have been very clear with us over the last 90 days that this is the issue, particularly our large enterprise and our service providers. We talked about that with the service providers prior, but it shifted into the enterprise space in a big way.\nThe other thing is we had our partner summit last week, and some of our largest partners, unsolicited, began their conversations with me by talking about this very issue, which, candidly, I knew the customers had talked about it and our sales teams had talked about it. I was actually surprised to hear it so consistently at that Partner Summit.\nThat's sort of the subjective view. We've done some analysis, and there are three things I'd point out. The first is that in certain parts of our portfolio, we actually can see the timeframe from shipment of a product until the product begins to connect to the cloud, back to the cloud, like Meraki. What we've seen is a one to two quarter delay versus what historically you would see when these products get shipped, how long it takes for them to be activated and connect to the Meraki cloud. That's the first piece.\nThe second is we had a very strong quarter in US federal from an orders perspective, so we looked into why big customers like the US government, Department of Defense, would not have the same issue.\nThe reality is that they have special clauses in their contracts that give them most favored nation status when we're actually making shipment decisions. Certainly with the Department of Defense, we prioritize them during the supply chain crisis. They never had a big influx. They had a very steady flow of products across, which explains why their order numbers look fairly normal. The third point I'd say is that we noticed a serious uptick in Q1 in our transactional advanced services, which is loosely translated to be implementation services, where that grew almost 20%, and the forecast for Q2 is almost double digits again.\nIt's clear that customers are asking us to come help them get this done. I'll give you one final subjective data point, and then I'll talk about the AI stuff.\nWe had one big partner tell us that they have literally hired 200 people in the last 90 days solely focused on implementing technology for their customers. There were just so many things that we've learned over the last 90 days. Clearly, this surprised us, but I think we feel pretty good right now. I'll make a comment about why I don't think it's macro. Candidly, it might have been easier for me to say it was macro. As we've discussed prior, the traditional service provider has been tough, and it remains that way. We've talked about elongated sales cycle. They remain. We've talked about, in some cases, the need for extra signatures, which is pretty normal.\nThat's remained, but we didn't see it get materially worse in the quarter. All of that, and I'm sorry for the long answer, but I wanted to be thorough.\nAll of that is really what led us to believe that this is a consumption issue with our customers. I'm going to pause there, and then I'm going to answer your AI question. What we gave last time was orders to date. We had taken orders for over $500 million for infrastructure to support AI networks, AI GPUs inside the cloud players. I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.\nThe numbers that we gave today is a forward-looking set of numbers that say in fiscal year 2025, which is when we said we believe that the broad Ethernet buildout would occur underneath GPUs, we have already seen we have line of sight to a billion dollar plus of orders that our teams feel pretty good that we're going to get and/or we've been designed in already.\nThat's just sort of a forward-looking set of orders that we've identified for fiscal 2025. I will also just cover real quickly, we now have our Ethernet fabric deployed underneath GPUs in three of the four major hyperscalers in the United States. We also are working very closely with AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA to create solutions, including Ethernet technologies, GPU-enabled infrastructure, and jointly tested and validated reference architectures.\nI will say even this week, yesterday, Jensen from NVIDIA and four or five of his executives came over to see us, and we spent 90 minutes together with my executive team. We believe we have a great opportunity to actually build some integrated solutions between our technology and their technology to actually take to the enterprise.\nWe're beginning to see the use cases in the enterprise evolve, and we think that a partnership with NVIDIA in that case, with our underlying technology and our strength of go-to-market, will be a winning combination. We're working on that as well. There's a lot going on in the AI space.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you, Amit. Michelle, next question.\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James, you may go ahead.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you'd be willing to unpack the networking segment a little bit in terms of the trends. Really, what I'm trying to get at is understand sort of what's doing better, what's doing worse. In that, I suspect its data center sounds to us pretty good, whereas maybe campus is a bit weaker and declining. Hopefully, during this transition to a new segmentation, you can give us a little bit more color within networking. Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nHey, Simon, thanks for that. I would say the bigger variance that we're seeing, I mean, right now, obviously, the demand signal is a little bit tough because of the amount of inventory that's out in the field. We have normalized lead times at this point. We knew that would happen sometime in the first half. It's now happened. Our lead times are back to where they were pre-pandemic, and our backlog has shipped. The supply chain team has done a terrific job getting product out the door.\nThat's what's kind of moved the bottleneck from our level down to our customer's level. When you start to unpack within networking, we're not seeing at this point a huge difference between, for example, data center or campus networking. What we are seeing is a little more field-based inventory on wireless access points.\nThat's been slightly slower than what we've seen just because of the amount of product that's been shipped out than what we've seen in the rest of the networking.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThank you very much. Thank you, Simon.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYep, thanks, Simon.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, Michelle, next question.\nBen Rice with [miLEAD] Research. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nBen Rice\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about your share repurchase cadence. Stock obviously could get hit here. We have been talking about $5 billion in buybacks or so for the year. I know some of that stuff, that dilution. If you guys are confident in the second-half pickup, is there any potential that you would be more aggressive in the upcoming quarter? How are you thinking about share repo this year, given the current dynamics with the Splunk deal coming? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Ben, as we said on the Splunk transaction, it's going to be outside of the transactional cost. It's going to be cash flow positive from the first year forward. The Splunk transaction is not in any way having an effect on our capital return, either through the dividend or through share buybacks. We expect to continue at a higher level, and consistently higher level, of share buybacks, and to continue to show increases in our dividend. We will also obviously look at the opportunity, at the chance to be opportunistic on the share buyback. I'm not going to commit to that at this moment, but that is something that we'll obviously take a look at.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you, Ben. All right, Michelle, next question.\nSamik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan, you may go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess if I can just clarify one thing first. I think, Chuck, in your prepared remarks, you did say you saw the more pronounced impact on the orders in the month of October. I think that's what I heard you say. I mean, just curious, are you implying that you did see an improvement in orders in the sort of first couple of weeks of November itself? That's maybe part of your confidence in that it's a bit more temporary than a longer pause from the customers.\nYou did mention that large partners are really being the ones that are facing this sort of inventory installation problem. What gives you sort of color that SMBs, the smaller customers, are sort of not going to face a similar issue?\nAre you also baking that in terms of your sort of next couple of quarters of headwinds that you're thinking about on the revenue side? Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Samik. I think my point with October was that if you go back to the end of Q4, we talked about on the last call that we had a fair amount of momentum as we exited the quarter, which is one of the reasons we did not expect to see this. We had our normal year-end sales, moving accounts around, moving territories around, and getting sort of the sales startup process that happens in the first, say, six weeks of the fiscal year, which we went through. What we tend to look for is the middle of the quarter and then into October, when we expect to see the actual quarter materialize and everything kind of come together. It just did not.\nThat was the comment about that it was primarily, it was really clear to us in October that this was going to be the situation. Relative to they're the ones who are having the consumption issue because they have the most inventory. You asked how we, what confidence will we have if it's not SMB? If you look at orders, we look at a sub-segmentation within the enterprise now and within the service provider, etc. SMB was fine. In fact, the smaller the customer we had, the better their order performance for us in the quarter was. It just followed the trend that the consumption issue was upmarket, and the small to mid-sized customers didn't feel it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, thank you. Samik. Michelle, next question.\nDavid Vogt with UBS you may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Scott, maybe this is for you. I just want to unpack maybe one of the comments that you made. I know you don't guide to orders, but I think in your prepared remark, you said backlog is back at normal levels at the end of the quarter. Are we to assume that the guide for Q2 and the rest of the year doesn't include backlog conversion into revenue?\nIf that's the case, to your comment about orders accelerating in the second half, I know you don't guide specifically to orders, but you did make a comment that revenue is going to be up, I think, sequentially in Q3, year-over-year, and in Q4, sequentially and year-over-year.\nDoesn't that suggest a pretty steep order acceleration, not just an acceleration, but a significant positive order trajectory in Q4 and Q3? I know it's easy comps, but just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, yeah. David, we did say that. We are expecting sequential improvement in the second half of the year in both Q3 and Q4. Again, we don't guide this, but in both orders and revenue, as you'd expect, backlog is normalized at this point. We knew that would happen in the first half. I think the supply chain team did a great job getting those orders in the hands of our customers. We now need them to implement them, but we've got the orders in the hands of our customers. We do see sequential increases. As you said, as you noted, from a booking standpoint or order standpoint, the second half has easier compare points.\nObviously, the reverse is true on revenue. The second half revenue will be very difficult to compare points to the last year.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you [crosstalk]. All right. Thank you, David. Michelle, next question.\nMatt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just to dovetail, one follow-up to the prior question. I have just another one on margins. Just on the prior one, is the expectation for a second-half improvement in a one to two-quarter digestion? does that vary at all across the three different customer sets you outlined? Then just on the margins, so 36.6 on Op income margins this quarter, I think the guide implies a 400 to 500 basis point dip. Is that due to just the sheer revenue decline sequentially, or are there other cost items we should consider on either the gross margin or OI margin line? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. To your second question, it is just based on how the revenues are flowing through the second half of the year. I think gross margins, we've said, will settle in somewhere in this 65% to 66 range. I think at this point, it looks like it'll be closer to the higher end of that range for the second part of the year. That's the way I see the year flowing out. Remind me, Matt, what was the first part of your question?\n\nMatt Niknam\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust around the expectation for second-half improvements in orders, one to two quarters' worth of installation. Is that broad across the three customer sets, or does it vary across service provider, enterprise, and federal?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, right. I think we expect, I certainly would expect, service provider to continue to be difficult through the second half of the year. Within service provider, we've got both Telco and Cable, which have one set of market dynamics going on. I think that'll continue to be a difficult space. On the other side, we have web scale, and we do see the web scale orders. While they've also got inventory to work their way through, we do see line of sight to them beginning to increase their orders again in the second half of the year. SP is a bit of a mixed bag, but I think it'll continue to have probably the greater impact.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matt, Michelle, next question.\nGeorge Nader, with Jefferies, you may go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Jefferies)\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks a lot, guys. Just continuing on that last question. If I look around the space, companies have been dealing with excess inventories for really three quarters now. I guess I'm just curious, why is this now becoming more evident at Cisco versus a few quarters ago? You mentioned that the issue is spreading more to enterprises. We don't typically think about enterprises as inventoring infrastructure. I guess the question for you is, has something changed there, or is this more distribution channel inventory? Any insight would be great. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, George. I think that the reason it's become relevant now is because, I mean, we really unloaded our backlog in the last six months. I mean, it was billions of dollars more than what we would normally ship to customers during that time period. I think it's just, and we know that the cloud providers, as an example, had been buying ahead, and they had been doing it for sure, to your point. All along, we have very sequenced purchasing cycles with those players, so we kind of know when they're going to start placing their next orders. I think on the enterprise, we're talking about the top 200 customers, right?\nThese are the big customers who actually, if they're doing a refresh of their infrastructure, they might order 400 switches to 500, as an example, or they may be doing a branch rollout.\nIn some cases, to your point, it could be sitting with them, or they could have a partner who's doing the staging, and the partner may be backed up with resources to try to get the staging done. It varies, but it could be either one of those or a combination of both.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGeorge, just to put some data to that, you have this data, but I'll repeat it. Our revenue growth, obviously, the quarter we're announcing now, product revenue growth was 9%. If you go back to Q4, product revenue growth was 20%, and in Q3, it was 17%. Obviously, we get revenue when we can complete a shipment and get it out the door. It gives you a sense of just how much has been pushed out, and as Chuck said, in the last two to three quarters.\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you, George. Michelle, we have time for one last question.\nThank you. Michael Wang with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.\n\nMichael Wang\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, on the AI orders, a dollar billion, what's the feedback from the hyperscalers on your improving position with these customers relative to a few years ago? Is it selling in a more disaggregated fashion with Silicon One? Is it a desire for Silicon diversification? The second question, just as a follow-up on the order slowdown, was that more concentrated in the campus with wireless LAN and wired, or data center, or both, just within enterprise specifically? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Michael. On the AI question relative to the cloud players, I think early on, we regained our footing there because we listened, and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so. We're in, I can't even remember, but numerous use cases across the large web-scale players. I think we added another over 10 new use cases last quarter alone, where we had been designed in. I think the disaggregation and the flexibility, and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted, was the reason that we got back in.\nNow the feedback is, as long as we're performing, I think they like our products. They like the power savings of Silicon One. It's massively lower power consumption. I think they do like Silicon diversity, for sure.\nAs you look at the AI infrastructure that's currently primarily being supported via InfiniBand, they just want to move to more of a standard, broad-based technology like Ethernet, so that they can actually have multiple sources. We think that's what's driving that now. Now it's just about performing, executing, and delivering on what we tell them we're going to do. Scott, you want to take the second?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Michael. I think I touched on this earlier, as the question came up. I think that the way to think about it is, first of all, if you're trying to generalize the trend more broadly across the industry, it may be a little difficult because we've cleared our backlog, I think, significantly faster than others have. Where we saw differentiation was less between, say, data center infrastructure and campus networking, and more between networking and wireless.\nWe did see, because we've shipped an enormous amount of wireless access points out, we did see that take a little bit more of an impact just because our customers are sitting on more inventory on hand of that that they're looking to get installed.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you, Michael. All right. We'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thank you, Sami, and welcome again. Listen, we're proud of the team for the performance in Q1. Obviously, very solid quarter with the exception of this demand issue that we talked about. We'll always try to be transparent with you and share with you exactly what we're seeing. We know what's going on. We're on top of it, and we do feel that it's temporary. At the same time, we're very confident in our opportunities long term. We're confident in the AI opportunity. We're very encouraged by our improving position in security, observability, and we're also very encouraged by the opportunities that will come with the Splunk acquisition.\nI think many of you know that on Monday night, the waiting period for review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in the US expired, meaning that we've effectively passed the antitrust review period in the United States. We're excited about that.\nAt our partner summit last night or last week, the feedback on our portfolio right now was probably as good as it's been in a long time. I also just want to reiterate our commitment to delivering value to you and our shareholders via operating leverage, capital allocation, and obviously managing our expenses in times when we see challenges like we have right now. Thank you for joining us today I'll turn it back over to Sami.\n\nSami Badri\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nCisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 Q2 results, will be on Wednesday, 14 February 2024, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Q4 Fiscal 2023 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis.\nThe matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the Q1 and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was a milestone year for Cisco. We delivered on our operational and financial goals while accelerating our transformation. We achieved record revenue and earnings per share in both the Q4 and the full year. We also generated strong margins, record operating cash flow, and strong shareholder value, returning $10.6 billion US dollars via share repurchases, and increasing cash dividends. In FY 2023, we delivered nearly $57 billion US dollars in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, the highest revenue growth rate in over a decade. Overall customer demand also remained solid. In Q4, we achieved over 30% total sequential product order growth, the second highest in 20 years, with double-digit increases across all customer markets.\nAs we look to build on this strong performance going forward, we remain focused on the following: first, growing market share in all key areas of our business; second, driving innovation and extending our leadership by investing in significant new opportunities for growth in AI, cloud, and security; third, delivering long-term sustainable value creation for our stakeholders; and fourth, transforming our business model by growing recurring revenue. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect to build on our record results, delivering modest revenue growth in fiscal year 2024, with the bottom line growing faster than the top line, demonstrating operating leverage. Our outlook reflects good visibility and predictability driven by healthy backlog, ARR, and RPO. We remain deeply committed to building shareholder value and increasing returns to our investors.\nWe will do this through a long-term commitment to greater operating leverage while increasing our annual share repurchases, and growing our dividend. Now, let me share additional detail on the quarter and key growth opportunities ahead for Cisco. First, one of our greatest competitive advantages is our pace of innovation. This quarter, we announced new solutions spanning generative AI, hybrid work, security, full-stack observability, and sustainability. In addition, we remain focused on delivering a more unified and simpler experience for our customers. As I've stated in the past, we knew that as our backlog cleared, we would see corresponding market share gains. With the release of the calendar Q1 results, we gained over 3 percentage points of market share year-over-year in our three largest networking markets: campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing. We expect further share gains in these areas as market share numbers are released for calendar Q2.\nSecond, the acceleration of AI will fundamentally change our world and create new growth drivers for us. While AI has been an important element in our products for several years, this quarter, we announced new market-leading AI technologies across our collaboration and security portfolios, designed to boost productivity, enhance policy management, and simplify tasks. We also launched new AI skill infrastructure innovation to allow our customers to process AI workloads more efficiently. Cisco's ASIC design and scalable fabric for AI position us very well to build out the infrastructure that hyperscalers and others need to build AI/ML clusters. This is a huge opportunity for Cisco, and we are laser-focused on leading and winning in this space. As a result of our innovation in this area, we expect Ethernet will lead in connecting AI workloads over the next five years.\nTo accelerate this transition, Cisco became a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, an industry-wide effort to drive open, large-scale Ethernet-based fabrics for high-performance networking. In June, we launched our next-generation Silicon One switching ASICs to support large-scale GPU clusters for AI and ML workloads. We are seeing early success in hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric deployments. To date, we have taken orders for over $500 million US dollars for AI Ethernet fabrics. We are also piloting 800Gbps capabilities for AI training fabrics. Overall, Cisco is committed to helping our customers navigate this transition in a trusted and responsible way to deliver on the full promise of this technology, and we are well-positioned to win. Next, security remains a top priority. Our AI-driven security cloud platform has comprehensive capabilities across the network, endpoint, and the cloud, helping to simplify security management while increasing efficacy.\nNew technologies like XDR, Multicloud Defense, and cloud Secure Access, a Security Service Edge solution, are seeing rapid early adoption. For example, Goldman Sachs has been one of our early adopters of our Multicloud Defense solution. In addition, we are working with Apple to incorporate Cisco's Secure Access solution into iOS and macOS. These innovations, combined with our recent acquisitions, show how we are extending our security portfolio with deep telemetry, AI, and identity threat capabilities. Given our install base of 300,000 Cisco security customers, we believe we have the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth and security over the next few quarters. To summarize, we had a phenomenal year. Our fiscal year 2023 and Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our business today and are a solid foundation for future growth.\nI also want to be very clear on our commitment to increasing shareholder returns through capital return, innovation, and strong execution. Last quarter, we committed to operating leverage in Q4 and fiscal year 2024, and our guidance today reflects this. I want to confirm that this will be our long-term strategy beyond fiscal year 2024. We will also drive a high degree of consistency into our stock repurchase program and will maintain the quarterly levels in the range that we have over the past few quarters. Finally, I want to take a moment to thank our teams, who all played an important role in delivering these record full-year results and their deep commitment to the success of our customers and partners. With our focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence, I have tremendous confidence in our ability to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead.\nI'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. As Chuck said, we delivered another record quarter driven by focused execution, continued business transformation, and the actions we took during the year to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest-ever revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, earnings per share, and operating cash flow in Q4. Total revenue was $15.2 billion US dollars, up 16% year-on-year at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $4.7 billion US dollars, up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.14 US dollars, up 37%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.7 billion US dollars, up 20%. Service revenue was $3.6 billion US dollars, up 4%. Within product revenue, secure agile networks, our largest product category, was very strong, up 33%.\nSwitching revenue had double-digit growth, with strength in both campus and data center switching, driven by our Catalyst 9000, Nexus 9000, and Meraki offerings. Enterprise routing decline driven primarily by access, partially offset by strength in our Catalyst 8000 series SD-WAN and IoT routing. Wireless had double-digit growth, driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the Future was up 3%, driven by growth in our core routing products, including strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 12%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings, partially offset by growth in cloud calling and cloud contact center. End-to-end security was flat, with growth in our zero trust offerings offset by a decline in our network security offerings.\nOptimized application experiences was up 15%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes and AppDynamics. We continue to make progress on the transformation of our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance in our ARR of $24.3 billion US dollars, which increased 5%, with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue accelerated to $4.6 billion US dollars, an increase of 17%, with software subscription revenue up 20%. Eighty-five percent of our software revenue was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue was $6.6 billion US dollars, an increase of 13%. RPO was $34.9 billion US dollars, up double digits at 11%. Both product and service RPO had strong growth, with product RPO up 12% and service RPO up 9%. Total short-term RPO grew to $17.9 billion US dollars. Total product orders were down 14% year-on-year but grew sequentially by more than 30%.\nThis was against a strong performance in the year-ago quarter, where we delivered the second-highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. The aging of our backlog has continued to improve as the supply situation normalizes, and as expected, increased customer deliveries reduced our year-end backlog to roughly double historical levels as we enter fiscal 2024. Order cancellation rates remained below pre-pandemic levels, which reflects the true demand and criticality of our technologies to our customers. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.9%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 260 basis points. Product gross margin was 65.5%, up 420 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and product mix, as we realized the benefits from the actions we took in the prior fiscal year. We also drove productivity improvements with lower freight, logistics, component, and other costs.\nServices gross margin was 67.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 35.4%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 300 basis points. This improved leverage was driven by both our strong non-GAAP gross margin and ongoing cost management. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $26.1 billion US dollars. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $6 billion US dollars, up 62%, driven primarily by strong top-line performance and the deferral of our Q4 federal tax payment. Consistent with our prior commentary, the IRS tax relief related to the California floods postponed our current year federal income tax payment until Q1 of our fiscal 2024. Consequently, in Q1 of fiscal 2024, our federal income tax-related cash outflows will include an incremental $2.8 billion US dollars of payments for these prior quarters.\nThis quarter, we returned $2.8 billion US dollars to shareholders, comprised of $1.6 billion US dollars for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion US dollars of share repurchases. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy that we outlined last quarter, we are committed to increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, while increasing our annual share repurchases and growing our dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year, we delivered record results in revenue, net income, earnings per share, and operating cash flow. Revenue for the year was $57 billion US dollars, up 11%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.89 US dollars, up 16%, demonstrating again the operating leverage that we've been driving. In terms of our software metrics, total software revenue for the full year was up 12% at $17 billion US dollars, with the product portion up 14%. 84% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points.\nTotal subscription revenue was $24.6 billion US dollars, an increase of 10%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%, down 10 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $16 billion US dollars, up 13%. We delivered record operating cash flow of $19.9 billion US dollars, up 50% compared to fiscal 2022, driven primarily by strong results, linearity, collections, and the federal tax deferral, as noted previously. We returned $10.6 billion US dollars in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases. This was comprised of $6.3 billion US dollars in quarterly cash dividends, and $4.3 billion US dollars of share repurchases. We increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year in fiscal 2023, reinforcing our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline during Q4. We closed the acquisitions of Lightspin Technologies, Smartlook, and Armorblocks.\nThese investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we had a very strong quarter and fiscal year with record results. We executed well, delivering double-digit top-line growth, profitability, and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue, while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q1, our guidance is we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.5 to 14.7 billion US dollars. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 65 to 66%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34 to 35%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.02 to $1.04 US dollars. For fiscal year 2024, our guidance is as follows.\nWe expect revenue to be in the range of $57 to $58.2 billion US dollars. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $4.01 to $4.08 US dollars. In both our Q1 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tim Long with Barclays, you may go ahead.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nTim?\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi, thank you. Yeah, Chuck, maybe we'll start with kind of the order backlog performance sounds a lot better than seasonal in Q4. Could you talk a little bit about what you attribute that to? Maybe looking into next year, it doesn't look like you're baking a lot of that into either Q1 or the full year. What's kind of the expectation for kind of the pull-through of those orders into what you're going to see in revenues in fiscal 2024? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks. Tim, I'll provide some color, and Scott, maybe you can talk about the conversion of the orders. First of all, we're obviously dealing with a world that has a lot of dynamics right now, but our teams executed incredibly well. As I've said on prior calls with our sales organization, when we see transitions in sort of customer buying, if it's getting worse, what we see is that our teams will forecast a quarter, and then by the end of the quarter, they will have dropped and/or missed. When it's beginning to stabilize and get better, they tend to actually exceed the forecast. What we saw in Q4 was they had their opening forecast, they nailed month one, they nailed month two, and they exceeded month three by several hundred million dollars.\nIt was one of those quarters that they actually overperformed what they thought they would do at the beginning of the quarter, which is a positive sign, but again, it's one quarter. We also had the largest quarter in our history of enterprise software agreements from an orders perspective. We had a lot of big customers making big commitments, which was a positive thing. If you think about what was going on around the world, I'd say service providers just continued to be weak. Enterprise improved, commercial improved. US enterprise was basically flat, so that was better than we'd been experiencing for sure, which is a good sign. Public sector remained steady, and verticals we saw strength in financial services, transportation, and energy. We saw some good strength in countries like India and Saudi Arabia around the world.\nIt's one quarter, but if you compare it to the prior few quarters where the teams had opening forecasts that they generally missed by the time we got to the end of the quarter, this was one where I'd say that it was much more stable as we went through the quarter. Scott, you want to talk about the order conversion?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. As we think about fiscal 2024, we've got pretty good visibility driven by really the business model shift that we've talked about. A couple of data points that I think you already have, Tim. One is current RPO of $17.9 billion US dollars. Total RPO approaching $35 billion US dollars, of which $17.9 billion US dollars is current, meaning it turns into revenue in the next 12 months. We ended the year, as we expected, with roughly double our normal backlog levels. That excess backlog will work down in the first half of fiscal 2024, with the majority of that being worked off in Q1, by the way. We've got $24.3 billion US dollars of ARR that we get a chance to renew. Obviously, some of that will already be captured in RPO, but there's opportunity that's not already captured in RPO as well.\nWe enter the year with, round numbers, 40% of that top line pretty much already in hand between those three categories. Feel good about the way we see the year laying out.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nIf I can make one more comment, Tim, on the sequentials. We said, given that the year-over-years are just sort of difficult to—they do not really provide a clear view on what is going on. We have been talking about sequentials a fair amount. I did say in my opening comments that sequentials from Q3 to Q4 were in excess of 30%. To put that in perspective, it is typically 18 to 20%. From a customer segment perspective, enterprise was well above that, public sector was well above it, commercial was pretty close to it, and service provider was the low one. However, it was still above historical trends on a sequential basis. Just to try to give you as much color as we can.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Very helpful.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nMichelle, let's go ahead and move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore? You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nYep. Thanks a lot for taking my question, and congrats on a nice set of numbers here. Maybe two things I'd love to get your perspective on. Chuck, when you talk about consistency in capital allocation, can you just expand a bit more on what does that mean? Are you going to think about this as a percent of free cash flow that you're going to go for buybacks or some other metric? Can you just talk about what does that mean and how do you intend to deploy the cap allocation? That'll be helpful. Perhaps somewhat maybe related to that, I guess, when we think about the fiscal 2024 revenue guide that you folks are providing, 7% growth in Q1, I think 1% for the full year, that sort of would imply a back half will decline.\nWhat are you assuming in the back half that gives you that kind of worry? That'll be helpful. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nLet me make just a couple of comments, and I'm going to hand it to Scott and let him answer probably both of these. On the capital allocation and the leverage comments, what I would say is that we've spent a lot of time talking to our shareholders over the last few months, and it's clearly important to our shareholders that we commit to, and we deliver on, operating leverage in our P&L. We've been doing it, but we haven't committed to it for long term. That's what we're basically doing today, saying that we are going to continue to commit to provide operating leverage in the P&L as we look to the future. On the buybacks, we had also increased—there are two things we wanted to do: increase the amount, as well as drive more consistency and predictability for our shareholders.\nThe rate, as I said, that we've been running at the last three quarters is sort of the target that we would be at on a quarterly basis as we go forward. Scott, you want to add to that and then talk about the revenue guide?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, will do. Amit, I think you were one of those voices that talked about cap allocation, consistency. I think I remember that at a higher level and also being consistent. What you've seen over the last three quarters is that share buyback has been very consistent at $1.25 billion US dollars, right around $1.25 billion US dollars per quarter. We see that continuing into the future. That's $5 billion US dollars a year in share buybacks. The dividend right now runs around $6.5 billion US dollars. You add those two together, that's $11.5 billion US dollars of capital return to shareholders.\nDoesn't feel like it's in a bad place, responding to the need to be both elevated and more consistent in share buybacks is what you're hearing. You've seen us do it already. The difference is we're verbalizing it in advance now, I guess. On your revenue guide question, I think it's easy to get a little confused by the year-on-year growth rates when we've had the supply constraints that we've had over the last few years. I mean, the reality is some of the revenue that we ended up posting this year in fiscal 2023 are orders that we took and customers wanted the product back in fiscal 2022, we just couldn't get it out. We couldn't get it delivered because of the supply constraints.\nThe better way to think about this is what's been the compound annual growth rate from when we started building that backlog and the supply constraints set in, which was the end of our fiscal 2021 through—I'll just pick the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2024. If you do the compound annual growth rate on revenue through that time, it's right around 5%, which is, as you know, in line with what we see as our opportunity longer term. I think it's a little bit tough to track what's happening when you just rely on year-on-years because the year-on-years have just been so skewed by the supply chain. If you step back from it and look at endpoint to endpoint, that growth rate feels pretty good.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nNo, that clear figure is really helpful. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amit. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nMeta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nExecutive Director and VP of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nRight. Thanks. Fantastic kind of data points around the traction with the hyperscalers. When it comes to kind of the half a billion of orders you noted or even kind of the 800Gbps trials, is that with Hypershield? Is that with Silicon One? Just kind of trying to get a sense of what piece of the portfolio that is. Just on the security portfolio, clearly you're rolling out a lot of new products, changing some of the sales approaches. Just when do you think we could see an inflection in that business? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Meta, thank you. On the Ethernet underneath the AI GPU networks, it is Silicon One for sure. I think for the next 12 months or so, we'll be doing trials. I think we'll have some opportunities, but there'll still be a lot of InfiniBand, and that's why we joined as a founding member of this Ultra Ethernet Consortium so that we can up-guide the standards and really deliver scheduled fabric, to your point, in a very effective way. We think into FY 2025 and beyond, this thing will begin to shift to more of an Ethernet-based infrastructure. On the security front, we've had some early traction. I mentioned Goldman in the Multicloud Defense, which is a great sign of confidence in that solution.\nIf you look at our XDR platform, which candidly, we just went GA with it right at the end of the quarter, we already took a seven-figure order from a retailer in Europe. That was positive. We took one of our largest security orders ever. We took an eight-figure security order from a Fortune 10 company in Q4. There are some early green shoots, and the teams are executing. The early feedback and early commentary from analysts and customers, etc., is positive, but we've got to actually deliver on it. Hopefully, in the second half of this year, we'll see some real positive impact in then 2025 for sure.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nExecutive Director and VP of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nMike Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMike Ng\n\nVP of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, it was encouraging to hear about the share gains on campus switching, SP routing, and wireless, as well as the expectation to continue to grow share. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sales execution, the product roadmap there that gives you the most confidence in that continued share growth. Second, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations as it relates to the trajectory of orders going forward. It sounds like if the backlog kind of gets back to normal levels in the Q1, it should just grow along with revenue growth as we think about order growth beyond the Q1, but just would love your thoughts there. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Mike. On the share gains in the enterprise networking space, which is what you're asking about, we expect Q2 will be equal to or maybe slightly above the incremental gains that we see when those numbers come out based on some estimates that we have done internally. I would say the thing that is really helping, beyond being great products, is we have done a couple of things. Number one, we have begun to deliver on monitoring and then subsequent management of our Catalyst, the traditional Catalyst portfolio, with the Meraki dashboard. That's a real advantage for customers. It allows them to run a hybrid of the two portfolios. It allows them to have visibility from one dashboard to both sets of portfolios. That's been really well received. It has been a key driver in significant improvement in our renewal rates on the software side.\nWhile I'm talking about it, I thought I would share one milestone with you. I've been asked for a few years, when do we think the software renewals in the enterprise networking space would be meaningful? FY 2024 is the first year I think it'll be meaningful. Just to give you a perspective on it, we expect this year to renew enterprise networking software at close to $1 billion US dollars. The transition that we've been going through for all these years is going to hopefully begin to start to pay solid benefits for us going forward. That's what's going on in that portfolio. Scott, you want to talk about the trajectory of orders?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Mike, thanks for that question. What I'd say is, if you remember our commentary from the last call, we said there were kind of three things going on inside product orders.\nOne was the lead times were normalizing, going from being fairly lengthy to going back to a normal level, which, of course, if the lead time yesterday was 30 weeks and today it's 10 weeks, means you don't have to place another order for 20 weeks. Those are mostly normalized. They will finish being normalized, certainly in the first half of fiscal 2024. That effect will be dampened. The second is backlog. As we were still sitting on excess backlog, and we still do, we've obviously been working our way through that and delivering product to customers. As we get their backlog orders in their hands, they can complete that project and then place the order for the next project. That has also been a little bit of a headwind to bookings. Then it's whatever's happening in the macro would be the third factor.\nWe think those first two will normalize in the first half of fiscal 2024. Lead times will be normalized certainly by the time we get to the end of the first half. Much of the backlog, the excess backlog, will ship out during the Q1 of fiscal 2024. I think we'll have a clearer view, and I expect to see more normal ordering patterns. Of course, we don't guide orders, but I expect to see more normal ordering patterns in the second half of the year.\n\nMike Ng\n\nVP of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's all very helpful. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you, Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nGreat. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nIttai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, guys. High energy. I like this. Chuck, maybe you could talk about the RPO, very strong performance there, especially when you look at the same metric a year ago. Maybe you can unpack this a little bit in the context of a few metrics, meaning duration of contracts customers are willing to go into now, size of deals they're willing to move into now. I'm just trying to kind of get in a little bit into the elements of this significant increase in RPO. Appreciate it.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ittai. I'll give you a little color in and I'll ask Scott to comment again too. A lot of this is we've made this transition to virtually our entire enterprise networking portfolio now is a subscription model, and so that contributes. Scott can talk about the year-over-year contribution that we've seen. I mean, we have $35 billion US dollars in RPO. I think it's an important thing because when you think about market share, and some of the concerns that people have had, you have to remember that we put a reasonable amount of each order in our core networking portfolio on the enterprise side into RPO and it doesn't get reported as revenue. It's ratable, so it's a headwind to market share.\nThe other thing that I would point out is that we had a record year at almost $57 billion US dollars at a time where we were building RPO to $35 billion US dollars, and we have the backlog that we have. We've had a lot of solid customer demand. I'd say in Q4, we certainly saw a fair amount of the enterprise networking as we ship those products. We saw the software come out of backlog, as we've talked about, and move into RPO. We saw a lot of these enterprise agreements that we did with our customers, and enterprise contributed to it as well. Those were reasonably large deals. Scott, I'll let you comment any more you want to comment on.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. You specifically asked about duration. There's not much change in duration overall, Ittai. That's not it.\nQ4 typically is a quarter where we have more large multi-year transactions. We talk about enterprise agreements and whole portfolio agreements. You typically will see a little bit of a bump in Q4 driven by that and then a little bit of an, I'm sorry, an RPO in Q4. In Q1, the typical pattern would see it come down just slightly as we work our way through those. I think the other thing to just bear in mind, we've got net RPO growth this year of $3.3 billion US dollars, of which product had a net growth of $1.7 billion US dollars. If you looked at our current RPO when we began the year, it was about $16.8 billion US dollars, which means all of that came out of RPO. Yet on top of that, short term, on top of that, we added $1.7 billion US dollars.\nWe added quite a bit of current year sales into that RPO balance. Back to Chuck's point, that's revenue that many of our competitors recognize immediately as they ship it. For us, we have the advantage of recognizing it over time, which makes us more predictable and gives us greater visibility into where things are headed.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAppreciate the color. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ittai. Let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nMatthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. A two-parter, if I could. First, as we think about fiscal 2024, you're forecasting 1% top-line growth and about 4% non-GAAP EPS growth with a fairly strong exit rate on gross margins. Is it fair to assume the lifts from gross margins may get offset somewhat by some OpEx reinvestment? Just trying to think about the puts and takes there. Then broadly, at the analyst a couple of years ago, I think, Scott, you laid out a 5 to 7% target for both top and bottom line. I'm just wondering if that's evolved at all in light of some of the greater emphasis on operating leverage that you're talking about today. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Matt, on your first question, I think gross margins settle. You saw our guide for Q1 of gross margins in the 65 to 66% range. I think it settles in there for the full year. You can do the math. With what we've projected on the top line, that drops down to a mid-single-digit OpEx growth number, in line with expectations, certainly given the environment of merit increases. It doesn't provide a lot of incremental investment, but I think that's in sync with what you've seen us do over time. To the long-term model, that was opportunity-based. If you look backwards, what you've seen is we have delivered the bottom line growing faster than the top line. I think the only difference that you hear from us now is, as I said, we're articulating it in advance instead of once it's happened.\nThat's really the way to think about that.\n\nMatthew Niknam\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nAll right. Thanks, Matt. Michelle, let's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nJim Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\n\nJim Fish\n\nDirector, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just diving in on the go-to-market side. We're hearing you guys are looking to move more of the specialist sales teams out more towards kind of a cross-sale, more portfolio kind of motion. Are you doing a larger sales restructuring right now? Is there anything you can do to better package solutions across these multiple segments, especially on the growth segments that are kind of struggling here, as Meta kind of pointed out earlier with even security? Lastly, on the capital return side, I know you guys get asked about this ad nauseam, and you talked about potential being strategic and all of that.\nHow do you feel about the push versus pull of either further acquisitions in either of the key growth segments that you outlined, Chuck, versus possibly even spinning off some of those segments like the more larger companies you're starting to see do? Thanks, guys.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Jim. That was a lot. Let me tell you a little bit of the history on the specialist model. I'll tell you what we're doing in the product portfolio, which allows us to clean up the specialist model a little bit and get them a little more focused. Historically, let's use security as an example. We've had these different products, and we've sold them all individually. Therefore, you need to compete with those individual competitors. You need subspecialists. You need specialists in every little area of security. What we've been doing across the portfolio is moving to more of a platform approach. It makes it easier to sell. In certain areas of our portfolio, like collaboration and security, we've moved to a suite strategy.\nWe're now packaging up the security portfolio in different suites, which allows for us to sort of optimize the security specialist or actually align them more effectively is probably the best way to say it. That's the work that's been going on. I think as we continue to execute on this platform strategy, it certainly simplifies the selling cycle for some of these technologies. I think getting to the suites, we've seen it work in collab. This past quarter, we had very strong order growth in collaboration. We had positive order growth in security as well. For collab to be showing positive order growth is really a byproduct of the suites and leading with calling as the lead part of the suite, and then also a big focus on cloud contact center, which grew triple digits last quarter from an orders perspective.\nThose are the things that we're trying to do. We're trying to get the portfolio put together in a way that makes it easier and requires fewer subspecialists in the field as we move forward. Scott?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nOn the cap return question, Jim, I'd just reiterate what I said earlier. With the consistency of buybacks now running right around $1.25 billion US dollars per quarter, so $5 billion US dollars a year, the dividend consumes another $6.5 billion US dollars. That's $11.5 billion US dollars of cap return that we're committed to. I do expect to continue to, as you've seen us do for the last 12 years, make increases in our dividend payment as you look ahead. That's one lens on it. I would say on the M&A and spinoff part of that, we're constantly evaluating that. We're constantly evaluating what's available in the marketplace.\nYou saw we closed three, albeit small, kind of tech tuck-in, but three acquisitions during the quarter. The team's very active. We're constantly looking at that space, as well as evaluating our own portfolio. There's nothing new to report there, but those are constant things that we look at.\n\nJim Fish\n\nDirector, Piper Sandler\n\nBubble color, guys. Thanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nAll right, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to double-click on an earlier question with regard to hyperscalers, the $500 million US dollars in AI orders. You had a briefing in June. I was wondering, have things ticked up in terms of activity there? It seems like maybe it has. I wanted to see if there's further traction that you could articulate in Silicon One. What kind of activity are you seeing there, and how big a business can this be?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Well, Ben, welcome, and thank you for the question. We have definitely seen traction in the space. Lots of discussions, lots of architectural discussions, lots of input from those customers on what they'd like to see in the next generation of silicon, as an example. The teams are off building that we just delivered in June. As I said earlier, the next generation ASIC actually is built for this. There's going to be more and more purpose-built silicon over the next couple of years. The teams are working on that, and those customers are having a great deal of input in how that silicon gets designed. In some cases, it's unique to each one. That's the beauty of us having such an advanced silicon capability.\nIt allows us, if we need to, to actually build unique silicon by customer because these opportunities are so large. In the last call, we talked about the fact that this would probably be 3 to 4x the opportunity size of the original cloud buildout. Unfortunately for us, as has been well documented, we missed the original cloud buildout. I can say with every bit of confidence right now that as we go through this AI transition to Ethernet, we are super well positioned. We have incredible silicon that they have been using in other parts of their portfolio. We won three more use cases last quarter. We now are installed in 21 use cases across the top six of these providers. We expect that that momentum will just continue over the next few years.\nI do think that in the short term, InfiniBand is probably going to still be the preferred in most cases, but they are trialing. We will, much like we already have, get some opportunities to run Ethernet underneath seas. As we deliver scheduled fabric, it'll become even more prevalent.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot, Chuck. It's good to be back.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ben.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ben.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ben. We'll take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nTal Liani with Bank of America, you may go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes. Hi. I have one kind of big picture question and one more specific. Maybe I'll start with the specific question. If I look at the 400Gbps Ethernet market share, cloud, if I take Arista and white boxes, it's like over 90% of the market. Cisco doesn't have much of a 400Gbps market share by the data. You are talking about growing market share in 800Gbps. Can you talk about the dynamics of 400Gbps and then why was it this way in 400Gbps and how it changes in 800Gbps and your expectations? Second is about the big picture. I want to understand kind of the numbers. Product revenues last year were $38 billion US dollars. Product revenues this year is $43 billion US dollars. So that's $5 billion US dollars increase. The declining backlog is about $5 billion US dollars. Your implied guidance for next year for product revenues is roughly flat, flat plus.\nWithout the support of backlog, how do you get to product revenues? What are the other parts that could go to product revenues and compensate for the fact that backlog is going to be normal by the end of next quarter or next two quarters maybe? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Tal, thank you for that. On the 400Gbps, the 800Gbps, I don't know that I've seen the exact reports that you're talking about on the 400Gbps, but our teams, the volume of ports that we're shipping on 400Gbps would imply that that's a, I don't know, we've had a great deal of success, and it's been growing quite significantly. We obviously had, over the last few years, we've been rebuilding or actually building our presence in this space. It wouldn't surprise me to see us as a low market share player, but we've certainly won our fair share. On the 800Gbps, I think it's just a matter of we're engaged there. We're installed already. We've got trust with these customers. They've seen what we can do, and I think that we're just in the game at the right time as opposed to where we started.\nI think from now on, it just gives us an opportunity to be there from the beginning as opposed to trying to catch up.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nTal, to your question on the math you're trying to do on product revenue, I think some of this goes back to the answer that I gave Tim earlier. One of the things you have to consider is some of the product revenue we delivered this year was actually demand from the prior year, right? Demand from fiscal 2022 that because of the supply constraints, we simply couldn't get out the door. Had that not been the case, you would have seen higher product revenue in fiscal 2022 and slightly lower product revenue in fiscal 2023, and you would have seen a steady increase then from 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024.\nThe things that are driving that are the things that we've talked about, right? We continue to see good traction and market share gains in our enterprise networking products. We are invested early in the AI game and see a great opportunity there. We're getting early success, although you're not seeing a lot of it yet in the P&L, but we're seeing some pretty early success with our revamped security strategy and the great work that team has done. Instead of trying to do it the way you're doing, the delivery has been lumpy. The demand has been less lumpy is probably the right way to think about it.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nAll right, thanks, Tal. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nJoe Cardoso\n\nVP of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question for me. You mentioned double-digit growth across all your customer verticals from an order perspective, but also mentioned service provider continued to be weak. I was just hoping you could touch on what you're seeing under the hood in service provider, specifically if I split it up between telco, AI, and non-AI cloud, how do those track compared to 90 days ago? Quickly, a quick clarification on the half a billion in orders in AI. Any way you can parcel out how many customers is reflected in that order number? Quickly clarify if that's all hyperscale or if there's any tier two cloud or enterprise customers in that mix. Thanks for the question.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, thank you. On the service provider side, the first question you asked, let me write my notes down. Hold on a second. I don't have to ask you for the question again. On SP, I'd say Q4 for the telco side of it, the communication service provider was probably fairly consistent with what it was the quarter before. It's just relatively weak right now. We see a lot of these customers are digesting a lot of the infrastructure that they bought over the next few months. We think that our team believes that orders will stabilize on the telco side of the business in the second half of our fiscal year. On the cloud side, we believe that they'll continue to invest, and they kind of invest in six-month cycles.\nWe think that in the middle of our fiscal year, we'll see a growth in that investment for the first part of 2025. On the $500 million US dollars, it is definitely in the tier one hyperscalers. I'll just leave it at that. On the opportunity that we see, we still see we won three use cases last quarter, and I would say those were primarily non-AI. We're still winning new use cases in the core infrastructure. We're in trials and different discussions with most all of them relative to AI fabric.\n\nJoe Cardoso\n\nVP of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, Chuck. Appreciate the color.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nAll right, thank you. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nIT Hardware Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. I'm not going to belabor the point on orders, but I wanted to ask a question about AI orders specifically in terms of your ability to ship to customers and where you are in trials. The reason why I ask is we've heard from a lot of companies in the industry that there's some supply chain considerations that are maybe causing commercial deployments and revenue rec may be pushed out to 2025. I just want to get a sense for that $500 million US dollars orders that you referenced in your prepared remarks. How does that flow through? Along with that, in the guidance Scott provided for fiscal 2024, how much, if any, is AI related this year? If not, why? Going back to my first point, when do we start to see it in your P&L? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco",
    "content2": "Yeah. Yeah. We do not, Scott and I are both looking at each other. We do not know of any supply chain issues we have around our AI. It is our standard Ethernet portfolio based on the Silicon One ASIC, and we are delivering it today. I do not think there is any supply chain issue for us on that front.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nWe might be at a bit of a better position than some because it is our own ASIC.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nIt is our own ASIC. Yeah.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nIt is our own ASIC. Yeah.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOn the FY 2024 contribution of AI, I do not have that information on top of my head. Go ahead.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nSorry. I did not mean to interrupt you there.\nSorry. Here is what I would say. Here is the right way to think about it, David. Those orders, what we see is within the broader hyperscaler world, which is where a lot of these AI sales are going.\nThey're obviously in digest mode. I think you've heard that from us and all of our peers for what they've bought. We do see toward the end of this calendar year, so toward the mid-year of our fiscal year, we see them beginning to place orders again for delivery of product that will happen in the second half. While I don't want to get into parsing the guide down to that level of granularity, I think what you should expect is it to be something that we begin to see show up in the P&L late in the second half.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. What I was going to add, David, is I think until we evolve some of the get some of the scheduled fabric technologies built out, they're certainly running some of these on traditional Ethernet, which is what we're deploying today.\nAs we get scheduled fabric out and these customers get more comfortable moving from InfiniBand to Ethernet, I think that's when we'll start to see the real impact of AI. Maybe it's late 2024, but I would suspect into 2025 for sure.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nIT Hardware Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Scott, were there orders from AI last quarter in the product order commentary? Are these basically new orders in this most recent fiscal quarter? Is that maybe the right way to think about it?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Don't think of the $500 million US dollars as all coming in in the last quarter. Those are orders to date that we know are going into AI infrastructures. That's not a Q4 specific comment.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nBy the way, a portion of that for sure is deployed. It's in and running.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nIT Hardware Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYep.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nAll right. Thanks, David. We have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James & Associates. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James & Associates\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what your assumptions are for your campus-related business. I'm including both switching and wireless LAN. I assume that's roughly almost $15 billion US dollars of trailing four-quarter sales, somewhere in that ballpark. I've seen market research saying that business declined, some saying it's growing. Chuck, you highlighted that $1 billion US dollars renewal. Just trying to get my head around how material that is and what's built into the full-year forecast for campus. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI'll make two comments, and Scott, I'll let you add to it. First of all, as we said, we think that as you see the Q2 calendar year share numbers come out, you'll continue to see us gain share in that space. We would expect to continue doing that. The renewal number that I threw out was close to a billion. Scott, I'll just let you comment on how you want to break down or if you want to.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. No, I don't think there's a whole lot else to add. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in campus. One of the things that we've said all along is as the backlog begins to be delivered, you'll start to see more and more of those customer decisions that went to us actually show up in the numerator of those market share equations.\nThat's exactly what you're seeing. I think the concern over the several quarters while we had supply constraints that maybe impacted us more than some of our peers, you should see those unwind as we can now deliver that backlog. The roughly $1 billion US dollars of renewal that Chuck talked about, that is a subset of our fiscal 2024 guide.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Great.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nAll right. We'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck, for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank our teams and just say how proud I am of the work that's gone into the last couple of years to actually deliver the record results that we did. We're incredibly proud of the share gains that we expected to gain, and we are. I'm proud of the team and the new innovation that's being delivered in areas like AI, security, and across the portfolio in observability, core networking, and SP routing. All of these areas, the teams are doing an amazing job. Our portfolio is very relevant to the customer priorities that we see around the world. I've never seen such consistency around the priorities in virtually every customer around the world, and our portfolio lines up nicely against the key things that our customers are trying to achieve.\nI'm also very proud of the team, Scott, and the rest of the finance organization for what they've done. We're very happy to provide clarity on our commitment to our shareholders with the operating leverage, the buybacks, and our dividend as we look to the future. Thanks for joining us today.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of IR, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Go ahead and wrap us up. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 Q1 results, will be on Wednesday, 15 November 2023 at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Cisco's investor relations group. We thank you very much for joining today's call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call eight six six four zero five seven two nine four. For participants dialing from outside the US, please dial two zero three three six nine zero six zero six. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to Cisco's Q3 fiscal year 2023 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Q3 fiscal 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.\nIncome statements, full gap to non-gap reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can be found in the Financial Information section of the Investor Relations website.Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both gap and non-gap financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis.\nThe matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the Q4 and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.\nCisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Marilyn, and hope you all are doing well. This was another strong quarter for us, and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. In Q3, we delivered our strongest-ever revenue, non-gap income, non-GAAP EPS, and operating cash flow. We also continued to successfully execute on our strategy, driving solid growth in ARR to nearly $24 billion and posting double-digit growth in subscription and software revenues.\nBased on our strong Q3 performance, we are once again raising our fiscal 2023 outlook for revenue and earnings per share, which Scott will cover shortly. As we look ahead to fiscal year 24, we expect to see modest revenue growth, even with the tough compare of double-digit growth in fiscal year 2023.\nNow, before I go through our Q3 performance, I'd like to discuss three key areas that will help drive our long-term growth. First, we are pleased with continued success in our movement towards more subscriptions and recurring revenue. In Q3, we delivered 18% growth in software revenues. We also have $32 billion in remaining performance obligations, and we expect to see this momentum accelerate. Second, security continues to be an enormous opportunity for us.\nAs you've heard me say, we've revamped our strategy, put a world-class team in place, and made this a top priority for the company. Over the coming quarters, you will see new innovations in this space building on our strong Cisco Security Cloud strategy, including at Cisco Live next month. Based on the rapid progress we are making, we are optimistic about our opportunity in this fast-growing market, and third, generative AI and cloud.\nAt Cisco, we already use predictive AI extensively across our portfolio. In addition, our core networking technology is already powering some of the leading AI models run by hyperscalers around the world. We have also moved rapidly to leverage generative AI capabilities in our own products, which you'll hear more about in the next few weeks and beyond, starting at Cisco Live.\nNow, let me discuss our quarterly performance. As I mentioned, in Q3, we delivered our highest-ever quarterly revenue and non-gap earnings per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. We saw healthy margins and record non-gap net income, which reflect our strong operating discipline. All of this contributed to record operating cash flow in Q3. As we expected, the actions we took to mitigate supply constraints have continued to pay off.\nPrice realization, as a result of the actions we put in place last year, helped offset inflationary pressures. Our disciplined cost management enabled us to continue to expand gross margins as well as prioritize our strategic investments to drive long-term growth. As it relates to customer demand, it is being shaped by a few factors that we believe are impacting the entire industry. First, our increase in product shipments is often leading customers and partners to absorb these shipments prior to placing new orders.\nSecond, the significant reduction in product lead times reduces the need for extensive advanced ordering by our customers, and third, macroeconomic conditions. With this said, in our discussions with customers, such as the ones we had at our most recent Global Customer Advisory Board event earlier this month, they continue to invest in key technologies that are core to their overall strategies.\nAs we previously shared, given the unprecedented demand for our technology during the pandemic, we believe sequential order rates are far more informative than year-over-year rates. Just like the prior two quarters, our sequentials in Q3 were in general alignment with historical ranges, coming in one point below the historical range. In addition, our order cancellation rates also remain well below historical levels, indicating the strength of our backlog and portfolio. In terms of our backlog, we continue to expect that we will end the fiscal year with roughly double our normal product backlog.\nNow, let me share a bit more detail about some of our newest innovations. Regarding our WebSCO customers, they are currently consuming and implementing their prior significant technology investments. There remains a huge growth opportunity across all these customers, enabled by our portfolio of hardware, software, silicon, and systems.\nWe already see early design wins in AI infrastructure and continue to see other wins and competitive displacements leading to continued share gain in this space. In our networking business, we remain focused on building solutions that drive a higher return on investment and sustainability. In March, we introduced 800 gig capability to our Cisco 8000 platform with the industry's first 28.8 Tb line card powered by Cisco Silicon One ASICs and Pluggable Optics. This new platform can deliver up to 68% power savings and 83% space savings compared to 400 gig solutions, helping to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions, as well as enabling the densification of networks to support use cases such as AI/ML and IoT.\nThis continues to drive positive customer feedback, and we're excited about this opportunity. To complement our own innovations, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Valtix, which is aligned to our security cloud vision for providing protection across multi-cloud environments with a seamless experience. We also announced our intent to acquire two companies that further extend our capabilities in cloud, security, and full-stack observability.\nBefore I close, I also want to share once again how incredibly proud I am that for the third year in a row, we were ranked number one in the U.S. on Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work for, and in 14 other countries around the world, we were also ranked as the number one great place to work, reflecting Cisco's position as a premier destination for top talent worldwide. To summarize, our ability to navigate uncertainty was demonstrated by our record results.\nOur performance remains solid and reflects the strength of our strategy and the benefits from the investments we've made over the last several years. Our operational discipline and excellence in execution are driving record earnings, cash flow, and shareholder value. As we look towards Q4 and fiscal year 2024, I'd like to share a few observations. As I mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal year 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal year 2023.\nYou can also expect us to grow earnings per share at a higher rate than revenue in Q4 fiscal year 2023 and full year fiscal year 2024, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. Lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher levels you've seen over the last two quarters. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution and our customers and partners for the trust they placed in us. As cloud, AI, and security continue to scale, Cisco's long-established leadership in networking and the breadth of our portfolio give me the confidence in our ability to capture the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nEVP and CFO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered a record quarter that exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations, driven by focused execution, continued business transformation, and the actions we've taken over the last several quarters to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest-ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP earnings per share, and operating cash flow for the quarter. Total revenue was $14.6 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4.1 billion, and non-gap earnings per share was $1, up 15%.\nLooking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 17%, and service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%. Within product revenue, secure agile networks, our largest business, was very strong, up 29%. Switching revenue had strong double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching, driven by our Catalyst 9000, Meraki, and Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing growth was driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 series routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing.\nWireless also had very strong double-digit growth with strength driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the future was up 5%, driven by growth in our core routing products, including very strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in Webscale. Collaboration was down 13%, driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings, offset slightly by growth in calling and contact center. End-to-end security was up 2%, driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings.\nOptimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance of our ARR of $23.8 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 18%, with software subscription revenue up 17%. 82% of software revenues were subscription-based.\nWe continue to have an elevated level of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 11%. RPO was $32.1 billion, up 6%, with product RPO increasing 9% and service RPO increasing 4%, and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. Total product orders were down 23%, driven by the three factors Chuck pointed out earlier. The aging of our backlog has improved significantly, and we continue to have very low cancellation rates, reflecting the quality of our past orders and critical nature of our product portfolio.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, and down 10 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.5%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by a higher component and other costs. Services gross margin was 67.3%, down 160 basis points year-over-year.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was at the high end of our guidance range at 33.9%, down 80 basis points year-over-year and up 140 basis points sequentially. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continues to significantly exceed historical levels. Due to an improving supply situation and our focused execution, we were able to accelerate shipments of our aged backlog to meet customer needs, which resulted in a decline in backlog levels sequentially and year-over-year.\nWe continue to expect to exit the year with roughly double our normal product backlog, and just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $32 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line as we approach fiscal year 2024. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $23.3 billion.\nWe had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $5.2 billion, up 43% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong collections and the deferral of our Q3 federal tax payment due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods earlier this year. The federal tax payment deferral had a positive impact of approximately 20 points of growth year-over-year on Q3 operating cash flow.\nThis recent IRS relief postponed our remaining current year federal income tax payment deadlines until Q1 of our fiscal 2024. In line with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to return capital, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $12.2 billion in remaining stock purchase authorization.\nYear to date, we've returned a total of $7.7 billion via cash dividends and share repurchases. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically on our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Valtix, which further strengthens our security portfolio. This investment is consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted strategic M&A.\nTo summarize, we had a strong quarter delivering record top-line growth, non-gap profitability, and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q4, our guidance is we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 14% to 16%.\nWe anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%, and our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.05 to $1.07. As Chuck mentioned, we are yet again raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal 2023, which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5% year-on-year. Non-gap earnings per share is expected to range from $3.80 to $3.82.\nIn both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our guidance ranges reflect significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO, and improving availability of supply. As Chuck mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal 2024 on top of our strong performance in fiscal 2023.\nYou can also expect us to deliver earnings per share at a higher growth rate than revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2024, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. Lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher level you've seen over the last two quarters. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and tee up the queue for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe if I can start with a clarification on the orders. I think, Chuck, I heard you say orders were sequentially one point below seasonality, but if you can clarify whether on a quarter-over-quarter basis they were up or down. I'm not sure if you gave a year-over-year, but maybe more broadly, as you think about your guide for next year as well, what are you assuming for orders in that? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Samik. As I said in the opening comments, there are three factors really that are affecting demand. First of all, as we ship more of our backlog, our customers are digesting what they've ordered. Secondly, as our lead times come down, which our lead times have come down 40% over the last two quarters on a weighted basis. It really eliminates the need for customers to order significantly in advance as they had been, and then obviously the macro conditions.\nWhen I talk about sequentials, as I've said, the year-over-years are just so hard to figure out that we've said the real thing we're looking for relative to whether we're seeing a momentum shift in the business is are the sequentials in line. As I've said the last couple of quarters, and this quarter as well, the sequentials were operating at or slightly below the low end of our historical ranges, so I wouldn't say it's robust, but it's still within the range or slightly below.\nAs we look at Q4, we actually expect our sequentials to be in line with what we've seen historically. Our view based on what we see today is that we can still deliver positive growth in fiscal year 2024, even on top of the good growth year we had this year. I'll make one other point.\nIf you go back to September of 2021 when we had our analyst conference, we actually laid out long-term top-line growth of 5% to 7%, long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%. If you move to the end of fiscal 2024 based on what we see today, we will be in that range from a CAGR perspective on a revenue perspective and will be above that range from an EPS perspective during that same time period.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Got it. Got it. For my follow-up, I think I wanted to sort of touch on that expense control that you talked about and EPS growing faster than revenue. Is that sort of a change of thinking from the analyst day in terms of, I think at the analyst day, you were talking about sort of limited operating leverage and growing earnings more in line with revenue?\nIt seems to be that outside of the gross margin, you're thinking about being a bit more disciplined and pulling back on expenses a bit. Maybe confirm if that's sort of how you if you're interpreting that right. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Samik, if you look at the last two years, we've actually grown EPS faster than revenue. As we look to Q4 and then beyond, it's pretty clear that with the gross margin expansion and with our expense management that we are implementing, we can still fund the investment areas that we need to fund as well as actually deliver higher EPS growth rates than revenue, which is what a lot of our investors have been asking for. We believe that's quite feasible for us to do now. Scott, do you have any comments on that?\n\nScott Herren\n\nEVP and CFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo. I think you touched on the key points. We will continue to invest in growth, but we also, as you've seen in the last two years, you've seen us do this, grow the bottom line faster than the top line fiscal 2022 and at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal 2023, and as we look ahead, it's a time to be prudent and so we see that happening again in fiscal 2024.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. At the beginning of May, Cisco announced a capital business acceleration program as a part of Cisco Capital. This is a topic we haven't talked about much on recent calls. I'd just like a little bit better understanding as to what's the strategy, thought process, and rationale for implementing that program. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Simon, thanks for the question. That's something that you've seen us do in the past. It's more a reflection of interest rates jumping up to 5%, our customers needing to get their hands on technology to continue to advance their own strategies, and us just putting our balance sheet to work a bit. It's not more complicated than that.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nNo real effect on your financial model, I assume, then?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo. Not in terms of profitability or in terms of the long-term impact that's going to have.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Simon. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. David Boyd with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Boyd\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Maybe just more qualitative and maybe as a follow-up to Simon's question, can you kind of give a little bit more color on what you saw, let's say, in March into April and what you're seeing today from a macro perspective? Because it certainly sounds like from our conversations with partners and other industry folks that March was a bit softer than people had anticipated and it didn't improve in April. Just would love to get your perspective there and then I'll give you my follow-up real quick.\nIf I kind of take your comment about the three-year plan, it certainly would imply kind of revenue growth next year in kind of the 2%, 3% range and EPS in the 5% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to communicate from a back-of-the-envelope perspective next year given the macro headwinds? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nI'm sorry, David. Could you repeat that second part, the numbers you had there? I didn't catch them.\n\nDavid Boyd\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah. If I just kind of take the back-of-the-envelope math on your 5% to 7% three-year target, that would imply revenue growth next year in the 2% to 3% range and EPS maybe 5% to 6% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to message here just so we have a sense for how you're thinking about the macro? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right, David. Thanks for the questions. Let me talk about the linearity that we saw in the quarter. It actually was very favorable from our perspective on the orders. While we clearly see that we're operating at the low end of historical ranges on a sequential basis, we did not see it deteriorate from the beginning of the quarter to the end.\nIn fact, our linearity was slightly better than it normally is and April was actually sort of in line with what we'd seen, maybe even a touch better than the first two months. We did not see that particular outcome. Again, what we're looking for is a change in underlying momentum. I'm not suggesting there's strong momentum. I'm just saying we're looking for a change. The best way to do that is to really understand, do the sequentials continue to play out the way they're supposed to? As of now, we see they are playing out very consistently in sort of the low end of the range or slightly below, and then, Scott, you want to take the FY 2024 number?\n\nScott Herren\n\nEVP and CFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, sure. Just on the math you're trying to do, David, I think you're in the right ballpark. What I'd say, obviously, I don't want to get into being too precise on fiscal 2024 yet since it's only our Q3 call. Bear in mind, that's growth on fiscal 2024 on top of, at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal '23, 10.2% growth in fiscal 2023. The last time we had double-digit revenue growth for a full year was back in 2012 in the bounce back from the global financial crisis. It's a very strong year this year, and we see a modest level of growth on top of that.\n\nDavid Boyd\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Helpful, guys. Thanks a lot.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nGreat. Thanks, David. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. George Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nTelecom and Networking Equipment Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about the growth expectation for this year. I'm curious about your view, how much of that growth comes from price, how much comes from backlog consumption? What are the bigger factors driving that growth this year? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I guess where I'd start is the biggest factor driving the growth for this year is the huge amount of demand we've had from our customers that's been sitting in backlog as we've worked our way through some of the supply issues. If you ask what's driving the growth, it's that. It's end-user demand. When you start to peel back to the mechanics of how that got put together, a lot of it is our ability to, based on a lot of hard work actually from both the engineering team and the supply chain team, to free up some of the component supply issues that we've had that's allowed us to work through some of the backlog.\nWe're not finished. There's still supply constraints. We think we end the year, just like we said last quarter, we end the year still with roughly double what our normal backlog would be, but we've made great strides on that front. Price has been a positive for us. As we said earlier, as we work our way through the backlog, more of the orders that we received prior to those price actions that we took last year have been delivered now. We are seeing it, but you'll see this when we publish our queue, about a point of benefit from price.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nTelecom and Networking Equipment Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nLet's go ahead and move to the next question, Michelle.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amita Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nAmita Marshall\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just kind of speak to the trends you're seeing within enterprise commercial service provider. You noted kind of seeing some digestion on the web scale, but just wanted to kind of get a sense if there's any different trends that you're seeing within those customer types, and then maybe just as a follow-up question, obviously, your customers have been going through cloud optimization efforts and kind of looking towards long-term architectures. Is there any changes kind of you distinguish from customers just on the outcomes or ways in which Cisco can kind of better help customers on that journey? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Thanks, Amita. The trends by segment, I think if you think about the three factors that I described, one is customers needing to digest the shipments that we're shipping out. Secondly, as our lead times come down significantly, they don't need to order as far in advance. If you think about who the customers are that have the most visibility and have done most of the advanced ordering, it's going to be large enterprises and service providers and web scale providers.\nfrom a segment perspective, I think the predominant issue we're seeing in the service provider space, which, by the way, contributed to 41% of the overall year-over-year decline, came from the SP space, which is less than 20% of our total revenue, so it had an outsized impact on our overall year-over-year decline. I would say in the enterprise, there's large enterprises that are dealing with the same issues and are doing the same thing. They're digesting the equipment, and they're not needing to order as far ahead. We're also seeing the same things that you've heard from others. We're seeing elongated sales cycles. We're seeing more signatures required.\nIn general, we're getting the signatures, but they are taking a little longer, and then as it relates to the technology trends and what our customers are focused on, the good news for us is that if you think about every customer on the planet basically has five key priorities that we actually align to. One is they're re-architecting for this multi-cloud world. They're trying to figure out hybrid work. They're rebuilding their entire application strategy and re-architecting their applications. They're rebuilding their cyber footprint because of all this distributed nature of what they're doing now, and they're focused on sustainability.\nOur technology plays across all of those very important areas, and we're working very hard with all of our customers in all of those spaces. And then the final one I think that's on everybody's mind is artificial intelligence or generative AI. I would say in the web scale space, over the next five years, the market opportunity well, the entire market opportunity for AI infrastructure is estimated to be at 8.5 billion by 2027, growing at about 40% CAGR from where it was.\nAs I said in my opening comments, we're already installed as a networking infrastructure for some of these early AI models that the web scalers are running. If you think about where we were at the beginning of the web scale build-out a decade ago, I said many times on these calls that we were not prepared and we got left out. I would say this time, for this AI infrastructure, from a networking perspective, I believe we are better positioned than anybody else. And our teams have done a great job getting us into this position, and we see that as a massive opportunity.\n\nAmita Marshall\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nGreat. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nAll right. Thank you. My question is on any kind of dynamics with the hyperscalers or cloud providers that led to any kind of product push-outs or delays of shipments or any kind of receipts that took longer to deliver. Anything that was shifted? Do you guys see any kind of shifting of deliveries or requests to shift deliveries in the quarter?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo. We did not see any of that. In fact, we've been fulfilling all the requests. There are certain projects that our teams have been working on that they have delayed, but those are around new orders, not around what's in the backlog. I think a lot of that is because there's so much focus now on building out the AI infrastructure for each of them. That's really what we see happening. It's an area that we've had lots of design wins. We continue to get design wins, and it's an area where we believe that we'll continue to gain market share.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you. One follow-up on gross margins. You talked about the modest growth in 2024, and you also talked about EPS outpacing that. Maybe we could get an idea on gross margin trajectory. Is there something you should be thinking as far as a glide path or an expansion range?\n\nScott Herren\n\nEVP and CFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Sami, you see the midpoint of the guide we gave on gross margin for Q4. We've seen significant progress. We've seen significant progress on gross margin through the year. I mean, the product gross margin grew 240 basis points sequentially. That said, I think we're about to the point where we're lapping some of the benefits of the price increases.\nThere may be a little more room in gross margin sequentially, but if you look at the average for the year next year, of course, if you remember the Q1 of this year, we had a pretty significant impact in gross margin. So the average for the full year will definitely go up, right, if we keep it the same glide path through fiscal 2024.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right. Thanks, Sami. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Matt Nichols with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Nichols\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. First, just to follow up on the fiscal 2024, the modest growth, what sort of macro assumptions are you embedding into that preliminary outlook? Then just secondly, if I could just double-click on security, if you can maybe talk about what's driving some of the softness or decelerating growth. I believe it was about 2% growth this past quarter, and what you're anticipating in terms of maybe additional backlog release and whether that can maybe help some of those trends looking forward. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYou want to take the first?\n\nScott Herren\n\nEVP and CFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. If we start on fiscal 2024, I think there's a few things, Matt, to keep in mind before we start talking about macro. We're rolling into the year with a backlog that's roughly double what would be normal, and that's really just a function of kind of the continuing supply constraints that are definitely improving. That's why you see some of the strength that we've shown in this quarter and in our guide for next quarter, but they're not done.\nI do see those normalizing sometime mid-year. By the second half of the year, we should be through most of the backlog. The second is the absorption factor. We think that with the lead times normalizing and working through the backlog, the absorption factor also probably gets itself worked through to next year by around mid-year of next year. When you roll into the year with 32 billion of RPO, which is where we are today, 17 billion of that being current, with almost 24 billion of ARR, which drives a huge renewal opportunity for us next year, and with backlog, it takes a lot of pressure off of what needs to happen from a macro standpoint.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThen I'd say on the security front, I think we've talked about this on several calls, and we've hired a new leadership team. The team is doing a phenomenal job. We had a big announcement recently at RSA where we launched an XDR platform that actually is one of the first that actually ingests data from our competitors and our partners across the industry. At Cisco Live, in a couple of weeks, we're going to make a next wave of announcements around some new innovation. I think we've acknowledged that we needed to get these new technologies out.\nI think that they're coming out with unique differentiation to Cisco, and I think that's over the next when you look out sort of the second half of next fiscal year, I think you'll see security really be accelerating into a growth driver for us.\n\nMatt Nichols\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right. Thank you. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you Michael Hsieh. You may go ahead from Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Hsieh\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. First, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about inventory levels on the balance sheet going forward, and if you have any information you could share with us around purchase commitments as well? Then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure, Michael. If you look at you really have to look at the sum of those two collectively because purchase commitments are there. They're firm commitments that we've made to take on inventory. The line between what's in purchase commitments and what's actually on our balance sheet is pretty gray. When you add those two together and look back over the last three quarters, we've worked down about $3 billion worth of the combination of inventory on hand and the purchase commitments.\nI think the team's done a really nice job balancing, ensuring we have supply to continue to work our way through the backlog, and at the same time, minimizing the risk that we have too much inventory.\n\nMichael Hsieh\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Excellent. Thank you for that. then second, it was encouraging to hear about the expectation to return to a normal seasonality in sequential orders starting next quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more texture around those expectations. Is the absorption of early product shipments that may have impacted the sequentials this quarter going to be largely done by next? Is it just the easier comps? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Michael. Well, when I said that Q4, we see normal sequentials from Q3, that just means they're in the range of the historical ranges that we've seen from high to low. It's not like an anomaly. It's not going to be significantly higher or significantly lower based on what we see today. We think that the digestion issue and the lead time stuff, we're estimating right now that most of that stuff gets washed out by the middle of next fiscal year. We think to really get back to where you see normalized sort of ordering patterns and normalized backlog, we think that's probably going to be the second half of fiscal 2024. Thank you very much for the thoughts.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right. Thanks, Michael. I believe we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Glad I speak to you here. I guess I have two as well. Maybe first on the hyperscale side, Chuck, you talked about seeing gains on the AI infrastructure side. Can you kind of touch on where are you seeing these wins? Is it sort of data center switching or Silicon One or something else? Then are these sort of net new applications getting deployed, or are these displacement? Just any color of that would be helpful. Yeah.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nOn the specific hyperscaler situation, we've been winning and displacing or becoming a second vendor in existing architectures for the last couple of years. Then we're winning new franchises around these AI networks in many cases are brand new, and we're actually winning some of them as well. As you think about AI, I think it's important to understand the underlying technology.\nJust quickly, today, what's largely used is something called InfiniBand, and we see that the web scalers, they have a desire to move to Ethernet and then further to this new technology that we actually have out called Scheduled Fabric. We support both Ethernet and Scheduled Fabric, and we think we're leading in this space. It actually increases the, I'd say, makes these networks run more effectively and more efficiently, and so those are some of the reasons we're winning but it's a very big opportunity over the next five, six, seven years.\n\nAmit Daryani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nGot it. Then if I could just maybe go back to this auto discussion, I think everyone seems to be surprised on autos being down 22% despite the compares getting easier, and I get your sequential commentary fairly well. Perhaps you can just talk about, you know, your compares that you get really easy for the next few quarters. Do you feel like this down 22 is a trough and the declines may still be there, but they sort of ease up till you get to the back half, or how do you think about the auto trajectory over the next few quarters and maybe the magnitude of it?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. It's interesting. Back four, five, six quarters ago, I said, you know, we see this huge bookings and revenues running at a much lower level. I said, there'll be an inflection point where revenue will run much higher than bookings. It's playing out exactly as we expected. Now, there is the added dynamic of sort of the macro uncertainty that people are certainly concerned about.\nWhat we're looking for is to see, again, if there's a significant shift in momentum from one quarter to the next, which is why the sequential thing we watch, we've watched it for 20 years, and it really helps us see what's going on. I think we're just going to have to, what we're telling you right now is based on what we see today. When we look at it, FY 2024 and the commentary we made about showing positive growth on a high growth year that we're having this year, it's based on, as Scott said, on backlog, on RPO, and it's based on the visibility that our sales teams have right now and what their expectations are for orders over the next 12 months.\n\nScott Herren\n\nEVP and CFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Just to add a little bit of that, Amit, or a little bit more to that. When you add up between what will be current RPO that'll turn into revenue during fiscal 2024, plus the backlog normalizing, which will be a tailwind, plus the renewal opportunity of what's not in RPO today but sitting in ARR today, round numbers somewhere between 40 and 50% of that revenue for next year is contained in those three lines, right? It's either orders that are in-house and sitting in RPO or sitting in backlog or renewal opportunities that we have a chance to go out and renew this year. When I said it takes a lot of pressure off of macro, it's a strong position to be in rolling into next year with that much of it either already in-house or sitting as renewal opportunities for us.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. That's a really good data point, Scott. I think if you go back eight or ten years ago, in any given quarter, we would have to take orders for as much as 75% of our revenue in the quarter, and that's certainly not the case today so that actually helps us as we try to model out FY 2024.\n\nAmit Daryani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Super helpful. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right. Great. And Chuck, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Marilyn. Hey, in closing, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today, first of all. I'm super proud of our results. I think our teams are executing very well. I'm proud of the record results that we had this quarter. I'm also really proud that we're seeing what we also said, which is the market share gains come through that we had talked about. We've been asked on several calls about market share.\nIn the reports that we expect to be coming out very soon, we have meaningful share gains that I think you'll see in campus switching, SD branch routing, wireless LAN, SP routing, some of our absolute biggest markets, which reflect the relevance of our technology to our customers right now. I'm really proud that looking at FY 2024, we still see growth on a strong double-digit growth year and also growing earnings per share faster than we are revenue. Our teams are committed to delivering on our commitments and we look forward to spending time with you 90 days from now, so thanks for being with us.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chuck. To close this out, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023, Q4, and fiscal 2023 results, will be on Wednesday, August 16th, 2023, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Q2 Fiscal 2023 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.\nCisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Marilyn. I hope everyone is doing well. With the tremendous results we delivered in the first half of the year, fiscal 2023 is shaping up to be very strong, fueled by demand for our cloud-driven networking portfolio, our continued business transformation success, and an improving supply situation, thanks in large part to our team's aggressive actions. Before I dive into additional details on the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the team here at Cisco. While the environment we're operating in remains dynamic, Cisco is better positioned today than at any time since I became CEO almost eight years ago.\nWe have reshaped and transformed the company and our portfolio while remaining highly disciplined, both financially and operationally. This gives me great confidence that we will continue to succeed in the long-term. Now, I'll touch on the quarter in more detail. Our Q2 financial results were strong as we again exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges. We delivered our second highest quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion, up 7%, and record non-GAAP EPS at $0.88. We also delivered solid ARR growth, sequential non-GAAP margin expansion, and record non-GAAP net income. In terms of our business model shift, we continue to make great progress with 10% growth in software revenue, and with software subscription revenue up 15%. Recurring revenue also now represents 44% of our total revenue. In addition, we have built up nearly $32 billion in remaining performance obligations, and our backlog remains robust.\nEven as we drew down backlog by 6% sequentially, our total backlog still grew year-over-year. These metrics, along with our increasing visibility, led us to raise our full-year outlook, which Scott will address in a moment. This quarter, we also achieved record operating cash flow, enabling today's dividend increase, and the buyback of over $1 billion. We continue to deliver on our commitment to drive returns to our shareholders. Let me also provide an update on the supply situation. While components for a few product areas remain highly constrained, we did see an overall improvement. Combined with the aggressive actions our supply chain and engineering teams took to redesign hundreds of our products, we increased product deliveries, and saw significant reductions in customer lead times. As our product deliveries increased, channel inventories also declined, as our partners were able to complete customer projects.\nLike I shared last quarter, as supply constraints ease and lead time shortens, we expect orders will normalize from previously elevated levels as customers return to more typical buying patterns. As a result, sequential quarterly order growth is a better indicator than year-over-year growth. In Q2, despite improving lead times, our quarter-over-quarter order growth was again in line with our historical ranges across most of our geographies and customer markets. With that, let me touch on what we're seeing with customer demand. In our customer markets, we experienced normal double-digit sequential growth in both our enterprise and commercial markets, while public sector performed better than we have seen historically. Within our service provider business, our order rate was below recent sequentials as some customers are absorbing the improved delivery of our products into their production environments.\nWe saw another consecutive quarter of rapid adoption of our 400 Gig, Cisco 8000, and Silicon One platforms. This reflects the ongoing investments our customers are making in our innovative solutions and AI-optimized infrastructure. Within WebScale, while we saw overall slowing due to normalizing product lead times, two of our largest customers grew their orders with us over 40% in the first half of fiscal 2023. We continue to take share in this space, and over the past few years, we've grown our WebScale cloud infrastructure from effectively zero into a multi-billion dollar run rate business. I'm incredibly pleased about the overall progress we've made as we are continuing to win more and more use cases within their infrastructure. We are also still at the beginning of what we believe to be a massive growth opportunity going forward.\nWhile we continue to closely monitor the global macroeconomic conditions, the overall demand environment remains steady and on par with Q1, and our pipeline and win rates remain stable. Looking at the broader landscape, digital transformation and hybrid cloud remain top areas of spend, which is fueling growth across our portfolio. Many customers have told me that while their spend levels may be slowing in some areas, technology remains essential, as it is vital to their overall business resilience, competitive differentiation, and success. In fact, Gartner and IDC's most recent surveys make it clear that technology budgets are growing, as they forecast IT spend to increase in the mid to high single digits in 2023. We are also seeing many customers moving ahead with their hybrid work, AI, and ML investments, while building the modern infrastructure they need to deliver on their objectives. IoT has also been accelerating.\nWe saw record revenue growth in Q2 as customers looked to connect their industrial systems in order to optimize power consumption, automation, and efficiency. Lastly, cybersecurity and full-stack observability remain strategic priorities where we continue to invest and innovate. From a product revenue perspective, we saw strong double-digit growth for Catalyst 9K, Enterprise Routing, Wireless, Meraki, Duo, and ThousandEyes, reflecting the ongoing investments our customers are making to modernize their infrastructure to rapidly digitize and secure their organizations. We are increasing our investments in our cloud management platforms that deliver the simplicity our customers need. You will see us continue to bring AI and ML into those platforms to further simplify how networks are managed.\nFor example, in Q2, we announced several new innovations across our cloud-managed networking and security portfolios that offer greater visibility with AI-driven insights, enable secure connectivity, and give our customers the ability to simplify their IT operations. Last week, we introduced a preview of our cloud-native full-stack observability platform, the first network visibility solution to support OpenTelemetry. This platform brings together our ThousandEyes and AppDynamics capabilities for unmatched data correlation and insights from the user to the application to the network. To simplify network security and policy management, our unified SASE solution, Cisco Plus Secure Connect, now supports integration into Cisco SD-WAN fabrics using Viptela technology, as well as our existing Meraki SD-WAN fabric. We also introduced new, flexible, more powerful, and energy-efficient servers, which not only help lower costs, but also help our customers meet their sustainability goals, an increasingly critical area for most of our customers.\nTo close, I'm proud of what we achieved this quarter. We delivered a strong financial performance, innovated across our portfolio, and continued to make great progress on our business transformation. In addition, the increased visibility we have from almost $32 billion in RPO, a healthy backlog and pipeline, and improving supply give us the confidence to raise our full-year outlook. We expect those same factors to continue into fiscal year 2024, giving us conviction in our ability to deliver on our commitments. The modern, resilient, and secure networks we are building serve as the backbone of our customers' technology strategy. Cisco is well positioned to benefit from multi-year investment cycles with our market-leading hardware, as well as our innovative software and services. Together, these allow our customers to digitize rapidly, secure their environments, and achieve their sustainability goals, all while delivering differentiated experiences. Now, I'll turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered another strong quarter and exceeded both our top- and bottom-line expectations, driven by our focused execution, continued success of our business transformation, and improved availability of supply, as the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters are bearing fruit. Total revenue was $13.6 billion, up 7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share, also a record, was $0.88. Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 2%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks performed very well, up 14%. Switching revenue grew in the double digits, with strength in campus switching driven by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching declined slightly, we saw strong growth in our Nexus 9000 offerings.\nEnterprise routing had double-digit growth, driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 series routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth, with strength across the entire portfolio. Internet for the Future was down 1%, driven by declines in optical and edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and double-digit growth in WebScale. Collaboration was down 10%, driven by declines in meetings and collaboration devices, slightly offset by growth in contact center. End-to-end security was up 7%, driven by our unified threat management and zero trust offerings. Optimized application experiences was up 11%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes. We made solid progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings, driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions.\nWe saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.3 billion, which increased 6%, with product ARR growth of 11%. Total software revenue was $4.2 billion, an increase of 10%, with software subscription revenue up 15%. 84% of the software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 4 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to have $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6 billion, an increase of 9%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of total revenue. RPO was $31.8 billion, up 4%. Product RPO increased 7%, and service RPO increased 2%, and total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. While total product orders were down 22%, they compared against 34% growth in Q2, fiscal 2022, which was one of the largest quarters for product orders in our history. We saw year-over-year declines across our geographies and customer markets.\nSequentially, total product order growth was in line with our historical growth rates. Within our customer markets, we experienced double-digit sequential growth in both enterprise and commercial, and public sector was better than we've seen historically. We continue to have very low order cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance range at 63.9%, down 160 basis points, and up 90 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 62.1%, down 220 basis points year-over-year, and up 110 basis points sequentially. Service gross margin was 69.1%, up 30 basis points. In our product gross margin, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher component and other costs.\nThis was partially offset by our strong product mix and positive pricing, as the benefits of the actions we took in the prior fiscal year flowed through as we shipped our backlog. Non-GAAP operating margin came at the high end of our guidance range at 32.5%, down 180 basis points year-over-year, and up 70 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the higher component and other costs that I just mentioned. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continued to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to draw down total backlog by 6% sequentially, although it still grew year-over-year. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $31.8 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line.\nShifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $22.1 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $4.7 billion, up 93% year-over-year, driven by strong collections, and we deferred our Q2 federal tax payments due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods. We expect to pay these federal taxes by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We also ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in remaining stock repurchase authorization. Today, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend by one penny to $0.39 per share, which represents our 13th consecutive increase.\nThis reinforces our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders annually, and confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, we had a great quarter, delivering better-than-expected top and bottom-line performance. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue, while making strategic investments and innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance, our guidance ranges reflect our strong pipeline and significant visibility, driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO, and improving availability of supply as we continue to benefit from the actions our supply chain team have taken over the last several quarters. We expect those same factors will continue into fiscal 2024, giving us greater visibility and confidence in our longer-term goals.\nFor fiscal Q3, our guidance is we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 11% to 13. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34, and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.96 to 0.98. There's also a significant change to our full-year fiscal 2023 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance driven by these same factors. For fiscal year 2023, we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 10.5 year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.73 to 3.78. In both our Q3 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%.\nI'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Scott. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck just for a few comments before we start the Q&A.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, before we get into Q&A, I just wanted to send our condolences to those impacted by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. It's been absolutely devastating to watch as the death toll has climbed, and we're working closely with our teams in the region to give them support and help on the ground as much as we can. We just want to let them know that we're all thinking about them, and we're here to help.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Michelle, let's go ahead and open up the queue for questions and answers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Marilyn. Ittai Kidron, you may go ahead with Oppenheimer and Company.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer & Company\n\nThanks, guys, and nice quarter and nice guide.\nI guess the big question is, when you think about the outlook that you have for continued supply chain improvement, how long would the order backlog normalization process take in your view? Maybe you can quantify on the quarter itself or perhaps on the guidance. When you look at the guidance, how much of that is coming from your ability to fulfill more versus the true underlying demand? I'm just trying to gauge for how long you can kind of keep this going at above normal growth rates for yourself.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Ittai, thanks for the question. Shockingly enough, that was the first question I expected. Let me just summarize sort of what we're seeing, and then I can give you more detail. Number one, let's start with the fact that our demand is stable.\nThat's first, based on the sequentials that we saw, demand remains stable. In fact, if you look at our Q3 forecast, which we normally wouldn't give you, the current forecast in Q3 is also in line with historical ranges of sequentials. That's the first piece. The second thing is, as Scott said, while our backlog came down 6% sequentially, it was up year-over-year. We expect that we will end the fiscal year, even with the guidance we gave you today, with a backlog that's roughly double what we would normally end the year with. The other thing to take into consideration is the business transformation, with 44% of our revenue now recurring, really helps a great deal. We have $23 billion of ARR, which we can actually renew in the next 12 months.\nIf you go back eight or nine years ago, we might have had to take orders for 75% of our revenue in any given quarter, and now we have 44% of our revenue coming from the balance sheet and recurring revenue. All that said, we actually believe that we'll still be able to deliver. We're confident that we'll deliver positive growth in fiscal 2024, obviously with pretty significant comps based on the guidance that we gave today.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer & Company\n\nOkay. I guess when I think normal, given your historical ranges before the pandemic, I always think about four to six as kind of the range, plus or minus, that you run at. Is it fair to say that from here on, anything above is kind of order eating into backlog?\nWhile your backlog is doubled, that can still mean that you can run above normal ranges for at least a couple of years, it sounds like, unless something unusual happens. Am I misinterpreting your comments?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nScott, you want to take that?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nNo, not at all, Ittai. What I would say is it's obviously too early for us to guide fiscal 2024. What we wanted to give you confidence in is we have better visibility than we've ever had in the past, both from the backlog and the $17 billion, almost $17 billion of RPO that's current, that's going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months in the ARR. We're going to roll in backlog that's roughly double what it normally would be at the end of the year. We have good confidence in where we're headed in fiscal 2024.\nI think it's a bit too early given where we are in the year, just at the end of our second quarter, for us to be a little more precise on that.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer & Company\n\nOkay. Appreciate it. Good luck. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks. Thanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ittai. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAmit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks. Congrats on a really good quarter from mine as well. Maybe if I think about the secure agile networking segment growing at 14%, that's really notable. I don't think the industry is growing nearly close to that pace. I'd love to understand. I mean, do you think you're starting to see some share gains come back to Cisco, especially as the supply chain starts to improve? Is that a tailwind that you're seeing, and perhaps that continues for the rest of the year?\nMaybe you could just talk about that, and also maybe talk about how is campus doing within that segment. That would be helpful.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Amit. Let me take the share question because I think I've said on several calls that obviously market share is reflective of revenue. With our backlog, as we began to ship certain products, we would be a gainer of market share. We certainly expect that when these numbers are digested and the new reports come out for Q4, you'll see that to be the case. One example is during last quarter, our wireless revenue was up 57% year-over-year. I suspect that's going to be a share gainer. The other thing to keep in mind is that market share is inexact.\nI will tell you that when we ship products into the WebScale infrastructure space, as an example, it goes into our routing reports, and many of our competitors put it in data center switching. It's very difficult in some cases to get complete apples to apples. I do believe that as we continue to ship our backlog, we will be gaining share. You want to talk a little bit about the campus switching? Yeah, sorry. I missed that part of the question. Amit, can you repeat your question about the campus switching, the second part?\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYeah, yeah. No, I was just wondering, within this context of 14% growth that you saw in that segment, how is campus performing for you very specifically, and how has the supply chain kind of alleviated over there for you?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, campus is doing well for us. The supply chain, while I don't want to leave the perception that supply chain just got better, our supply chain team and our product engineering teams have worked pretty relentlessly over the last several quarters with product redesign, with qualifying alternative components, with working with our suppliers to get to their subcomponents to make sure we could free this up so that the increase in supply that's leading to some of the share gains that we're talking about is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people inside the company. I think, frankly, it puts us in a better position than many of our peers in the industry right now from a supply chain standpoint. The longer answer, the short answer is, yeah, we're doing quite well in that space.\nAs we continue to deliver what we've just laid out as our guidance for the second half of this year, I think you'll continue to see share gain grow for us.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. Can I just ask you really quick, your back half guide is obviously fairly impressive. In the April quarter, you're sort of implying gross margins will be down 130 basis points year-over-year, I think, for the April quarter. Can you just talk about how much of that downtick you think is cyclical, things like the supply chain and logistics and so on, versus structural? What do you think normalized gross margin could look like for the company if supply chains truly normalize? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, the midpoint of the guide for the April quarter is about a 10 basis point improvement from the quarter we just announced.\nWe do see gross margins improving. It's largely driven by, it's less driven by cost. We're seeing some reduction in cost around logistics in particular, but component costs are kind of staying where they are in most cases. It's more driven by the fact that as we ship the backlog, more and more of what we ship reflects the price increases that we put in place last year. I think you'll see gross margins potentially continue to expand from where they are, maybe as much as 50 basis points in Q4.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nGreat. Thank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nThanks. Chuck, I appreciate that you all addressed in your prepared remarks the visibility demand trend issue. My apologies, but I'd ask you to revisit, especially in your enterprise business, including government and US federal.\nI'm sure you and your team are aware of what your competitors have asserted. I know, Chuck, you just addressed the market share issue. Can you give us some more color in terms of the solidity of the demand trends and the visibility that's translating into?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nWell, as I said, our enterprise and commercial business, which is reflective of how most of our peers represent enterprise, that was up double digits sequentially, which is in line with our historical ranges. Public sector actually performed better than it was above our historical ranges during the quarter. The other thing I would point out is that our quarter itself, from a linearity perspective, was quite normal. We actually had a we're unique in that we had the January month in our Q2.\nOne of the questions that we had was, what's going to happen to budgets as we enter into calendar 2023? We actually finished stronger than we started the quarter. Those are just a few data points for you. I think if you look at what our customers are focused on right now, I mean, think about some of their top priorities. They've got a complete rearchitecture of their applications to be cloud native, running in both public and/or private clouds. They're having to rearchitect their infrastructure to actually deal with the changing traffic patterns that multi-cloud brings to them. They're dealing with hybrid work, and how do I transform my IT infrastructure for that. They're dealing with cybersecurity threats on a massive scale.\nThey're also all focused on sustainability, which is leading to our IoT business growing significantly as we connect industrial systems for our customers. If you think about those big five trends, we're actually in the middle of those with all of our customers. We feel good about where we are. The last thing I'll say is that I was in Tokyo and Singapore last week. At the same time, a lot of my leadership team were in Amsterdam for Cisco Live Europe. No one is talking about cutting technology spending right now. Everybody seems very committed to it. I think the underlying power of technology as it relates to all of our organization strategy is just too strong right now.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nRight. Scott, back on the margin question, I appreciate you got to walk before you run, but you're now 3 percentage points roughly below peak on both gross and operating in terms of the initial recovery. Any thoughts for how much of those 3 percentage points? Can you eventually get back to 67% gross? Can you get back to 35% operating? And it's just a function of time or because of the price increases with respect to SIMIs or other things? That's just a bridge too far.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. I mean, as you talk long-term, there's a number of tailwinds that'll come into gross margins. So not necessarily talking about our guide for fiscal 2023, but longer term, there's several things that are going to be a tailwind there. One is continuing to work our way through the backlog and reflect the price increases.\nI think we will continue to see leverage in logistics costs, both from a reduction in the freight cost per kilo, but also in the mix of how we ship between what has to fly air freight and what will go in the ocean. I think we'll see some leverage there as well. I don't see a lot of our component providers outside of commodity areas like memory lining up to reduce costs to us. Right. I think it'll be the combination of mix that'll be beneficial to us, and some cost leverage in the non-component areas that'll drive that north.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nSo you think you can get back to 67, 35?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Are you asking me for a five-year forecast on gross margin, Paul? Is that where you're going?\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nYeah. Long-term. Long-term, can you get back to that model?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nLong-term, there's definitely leverage to push it back to where it's been historically, for sure, and if not beyond. Yeah.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Paul. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. I'm assuming as you're having conversations with customers, they're looking for more flexible subscription methods. Part of your subscription transition has kind of been evolving kind of the ELA model or kind of the subscription model you guys have had. I just wanted to get a sense of where you think you are on some of the kind of subscriptionization of some of your products and whether you are seeing a big impact of that right now. Maybe just some commentary about how you see the M&A environment currently. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nMeta, thank you. We are probably, I'd say, still in the early innings of transitioning the traditional portfolio to subscription models. The team's working hard on that right now, and we'll just continue to keep you updated. I think we're several quarters away from really having anything to speak about relative to the size of that business. We're working hard on being able to deliver that. The key is to give customers flexibility. Over the last seven years or so, we have disaggregated hardware, software, and silicon. We've virtualized software to run on x86 appliances. We want to give our customers whatever kinds of flexibility that they would like. That's the first part. On the M&A side, I would say our strategy, as you would expect, has not changed. I think the market dynamics have changed.\nI think that the longer valuations remain somewhat muted from their peaks, I think some of the companies are probably coming to more of a real position on how long these valuations may exist and whether the prior valuations were even realistic in the first place. We continue to stay aware of what's going on. We continue to scan the marketplace, but our strategy remains the same.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in data centers. In the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned campus was good, but data center was weak. I guess maybe I'm looking for not just the switching part of it, but your UCS business.\nWhat are the broader trends? How much of that is reflective of hyperscale slowing versus the broader market? Just trying to unpack that a bit. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, I'll make a couple of comments. Scott, I don't know if you want to give any detail, but I would say that our customers are increasingly balanced around how they're thinking about private cloud versus public cloud. We've seen continued focus on revitalizing the private data center infrastructure. I'll let Scott speak. I'm not sure on the infrastructure side or UCS if you want to share that. The other thing I would point out, Simon, as I said in my comments earlier about market share, everything that we sell in the infrastructure within WebScale flows into our routing market share numbers and our routing business.\nIt doesn't actually boost our data center switching the way we report it. It's a little bit of an apples and oranges issue. I just want to make sure you understood that.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nNo, that's a really good point. On UCS, if that's the root of your question, Simon, we are seeing nice growth in UCS as well. At least based on our calculations, I feel like we're gaining share there as well.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks. Maybe a quick follow-up. I was a little bit surprised that the metric of hardware attached software in backlog is $2 billion, same as it was in the prior quarter. I would have guessed it would have come down with the basically improvement of shipping the associated hardware.\nMaybe I don't understand that value, or you could talk a little bit to why that $2 billion didn't come down with the extra shipments of the related hardware. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, it's a great question, Simon. We actually did see, if you noticed, our overall software revenue grew 10% this quarter, back to double-digit growth. Some of that growth is on the back of shipping some of the backlog out, both the hardware and the software that's sat in backlog. We are seeing the benefit of shipping that out. At the same time, as Chuck said earlier, demand remains steady. Our overall backlog, while it came down only about 6% sequentially, still has a significant amount of software stuck in that backlog, some of it attached to hardware.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nIs software as a total percent of revenue or product revenue, that metric? Where's that now?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Just for software, it's in the 30% range. Overall, we're in the 44% range.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThank you very much.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nAll right. Thanks, Simon. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHi. Thank you. I had one quick one and a follow-up. The first one is on just the data center switching redesign. You guys made several mentions regarding supply and the team kind of working hard to get redesigns through. Does that actually mean the data center switching portfolio is now completed with redesign? That partly did drive the better revenue guidance for the year. That's my first question. The other one is we've seen several companies report elongated lead times for sales cycles and extra signatures and all these other elements.\nI appreciate, Chuck, you did hit on the fact that you aren't seeing any kind of tech spend get cut. Are you seeing some kind of resistance or slowdown as far as sales cycles impacting the speed at which you guys have historically done business? I take into account also, I appreciate your comment regarding linearity. I just wanted to kind of ask this question and get it through.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nLet me take the second one first. Scott, you can talk about the data center switching redesign. We absolutely are seeing some elongated sales cycles. What our teams have told me is that in many cases, there are extra signatures required. We just seem to, in general, be getting them. It just takes a little bit longer. Look, it's a complex world right now.\nIf you look back at historical sort of what we would consider a bit of a crisis or a complex world environment, I've experienced demand falling off a cliff. We obviously haven't seen that in the current situation. Scott, you want to talk about the redesign?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Just to finish up on that, pipeline looks strong, close rates still look good, so we're not seeing a huge difference there. There is, in some cases, a slight elongation. On the redesign, that's absolutely contributed to the growth that we're seeing, particularly in secure agile networks. Less so in terms of releasing the next successor product, more being able to design around problematic components that we couldn't get supply of. As we work those redesigns to build the product around components we can get our hands on, that's what we're talking about when we talk about the redesign.\nThere's no question that's driven some of the growth that you saw in the quarter we just announced, will continue to drive the significant growth that we've put out for the second half. To be clear, we will continue to see growth into fiscal 2024. All the trends we've talked about that are driving the uptick that you see in our guidance in the second half of this year, those trends continue into fiscal 2024. We continue to expect nice growth there. I just think it's a little too early to start to quantify that and give you a guide.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. George Notter from Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about your impressions of backlog and product orders relative to three months ago.\nI think I have this correct. About three months ago, you guys were talking about if product orders were down 10% for the year, then your product backlog at fiscal year-end would be two to three times higher than the normal kind of $4 or 5 billion range. Chuck, I think you were quick to say that it didn't feel like a 10% order decline was in the cards for you. It feels now like you are going to burn more backlog than you were thinking previously, and orders will be a bit worse than previous. Am I perceiving that correctly? What are your thoughts there? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, George, I'll take that, Chuck, and then you can jump in. I don't think it is burning down backlog. We clearly are, the good news is we're able to ship more of the backlog.\nThat's good news for our customers. They're waiting for these components. They've got projects that they're holding up that they need to get done. It's good news for our channel, in the sense that the channel is sitting on, in some cases, partial shipments. They need that last box so they can go out and implement that and relieve some of the pressure on their own working capital. I'm responding to the burning down backlog. This is good news, our ability to ship the backlog. That's what you see reflected there in the guide down, or sorry, in the guide up that we have in the second half of the year. What you see now is a significantly higher revenue projection for the second half of the year than we had before.\nSome of that clearly is our ability to ship backlog because of the great job our team has done to free up supply.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI would say on the demand side, if I go back 90 days, I would say, in general, I think there was more risk. At least it felt like there was more risk. When I talked to my customers, there was more uncertainty. Even when you listen to the news and I talked to my colleagues, we were in Davos. It feels like the longer we go without seeing some major shift, the better our customers are feeling. Obviously, we're not immune to anything, and we'll have to continue to monitor it. After traveling in Asia last week, our team being in Europe, I actually saw customers in New York while I was here this week.\nCustomers are moving forward.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, George. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. David Vogt with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys. I apologize if you covered this. My line cut out a little bit before. Scott, I'm just trying to clarify the order versus the backlog comment. I think, if I'm not mistaken, your run rate backlog had been sort of roughly $5 billion as you exit a fiscal year. Are you suggesting to us that the backlog comes down by about $3.5 billion over the next several quarters? If that's the case, if I just kind of backed out of your guidance, would that imply that the business is effectively flat year-over-year, x the backlog drawdown, as we exit 2023 into 2024? I have a quick follow-up.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Let me try and walk through some of the moving parts there, David. It's a great question. What we said previously is we thought we would end the year with somewhere between two and three times normal backlog. Normal backlog, as we said last quarter, is between $4 and 5 billion at the end of the year. What we now see is that it's still going to be roughly double that same range. There's definitely our ability to ship some out of the backlog, which is, again, great news for our customers and for our partners. The one piece that's missing in your equation is, as we ship the backlog, remember we said there's more than $2 billion of software in there. A lot of that software is ratable. As soon as we ship it, it doesn't all drop into the revenue stream.\nIt ends up dropping into deferred revenue and being recognized over time. You have to consider not just the reduction in backlog, what's the uptick in the revenue guide, but also how much of this is going to contribute to growth in deferred revenue. That may be the piece that you're missing.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, as we enter, let's say, the next fiscal year, I mean, given your excellent work on supply chain and the team's done a phenomenal job, would that imply, I mean, basically, we could be back at normalized backlog within a quarter, maybe two at the worst case scenario if trends hold consistent where we are today? Is that a reasonable expectation?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nRather than try to say it's a quarter or it's two quarters, I do expect it to normalize in fiscal 2024.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. He stole my thunder with the previous question. That was exactly my question. I want to understand something, just clarification on what you just answered. At the minimum, the decline in the backlog was $600 million at the minimum because if end of year is going to be $8 to 10 million, take 6% of that, and the backlog is now higher. That means at the minimum, your backlog declined $600 million. That means that product growth, we should take out some of the $600 million because some of it goes into deferred revenues. Am I correct with what you just answered?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Well, you're close. Let me run through it again, Tal. If it's still not clear, we can catch you in the follow-ups.\nThe 6% was the decline in backlog from Q1 to Q2, right? We were able to work off about 6% of the backlog that we came into the quarter with. What we've said is, at the time that we gave you that Q2 guide and the previous full year guide, we expected to end the year with somewhere between two and three times our normal backlog. We're now saying it's going to be roughly double the normal backlog. Some of that, obviously, will ship out and will be a part of the significant guide up that we've given you in second half revenue. Some of it, instead of turning into immediate revenue, will go into deferred revenue and be recognized ratably over time. It should open RPO. I hope that's clear. Yeah. It'll show up in deferred revenue in RPO. I hope that's clear, Tal.\nIf not, we can follow-up with you.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes. Very clear. My question—I want to go back to the basics and understand. Last quarter, we were all concerned about environment slowing down. We don't hear it. We don't hear you saying environment continues to slow down. We didn't hear Arista saying it. We did hear you saying that service providers were weak. Can you take us through the big customer accounts and tell us what is the situation of spending with your enterprise customers, commercial customers, service provider customers? Did the environment further deteriorate from the previous quarter, or did it stabilize? Does it make you think that at least the trend so far, the year would continue to be normal on a sequential basis, or you expect some more deterioration going forward?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Tal. On the enterprise and commercial space, we saw double-digit sequential growth, which is in line with what we've seen historically. As I said, public sector was actually higher than historical ranges, and US federal was extremely strong during the quarter from a demand perspective. On the service provider side, I think you're seeing many of our competitors and peers, some of them anyway, don't give order data. I think for us, those customers are the ones who did the most planning for long-term ordering. As lead times begin to come down, we would expect them to change their ordering patterns. They've already got 6 to 12 months' worth of consumption lined up in the backlog, so we'll see that normalize over the next few quarters.\nI will say in the web scale space, there are roughly 35 use cases or franchises within the largest players. We have actually been designed into 18 of those at this point, and we are very confident that we'll continue to get designed in. I got a note today that we had just gotten notice about a new design win today, and we are still very optimistic long-term. We just think it's a short-term normalization for our service provider space.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Layoffs and the economic slowdown. My question was whether these factors, you see an impact on your business, on orders, or they stabilize from previous quarter.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nWell, you mean layoffs in our customers?\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes. Yes. Across the industry.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco",
    "content2": "Yeah. Well, if you think about what occurred, there was a lot of companies that had a massive surge in employment, and we didn't.\nI think the thing that we're seeing right now is that we've seen the sequential growth be in line. It was towards the lower end. It's not performing at the highest end, but I think that it's in range. I also shared that in Q3, our current forecast is also in line sequentially with historical ranges, which we normally don't give. We just wanted you guys to have that visibility. Look, it's certainly an uncertain time. I don't want to paint a picture that we're immune, and I don't want to paint a picture that every customer is spending everywhere on everything. We've been able to maintain and continue to see our customers moving forward with projects. The one thing that was really encouraging for me was to see January as strong as it was, given the uncertainty around 2023 budgets.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Tal.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question. Tim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. If I can get two in here. One, could you talk a little bit about, obviously, the enterprise campus is still very strong. I think traditionally, it's kind of a GDP-ish type of business, and it's been running above that. It sounds like the confidence into next year is pretty strong as well. Maybe, Chuck, any insights? What's kind of different there? Are we starting to decouple from macro GDP for that campus networking piece? Any thoughts there would be great. Then, second, obviously, a lot of excitement out there about AI, ChatGPT, all that stuff.\nJust curious what you think for your data center and cloud businesses, what kind of impact if there's kind of more of an arms race with big customers around AI, what that would mean for switching and routing business for you guys. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Tim. First, on enterprise campus, I do think that the pandemic was a great educator for our customers about the need to maintain modernized infrastructure because moving into the pandemic, I think it became quite obvious to many of our customers that they had not been updating, and they were sweating assets a little longer. That's one thing that shifted. The second is we're really seeing these trends of multi-cloud, the trend of hybrid work, and the overall re-architecture of their networks.\nIf you really think about how we built networks for 20 years, we built it on a premise that we have branches and we have a private data center, and all the traffic flows are very understood. Now I have to upgrade my entire infrastructure to deal with this brand new world that I live in, supporting hybrid work, supporting hybrid cloud, etc. I think that's been driving a lot of this, as well as safety in the office, IoT, creating new experiences to get our employees back to work, etc. That's what I think has been driving a lot of the enterprise campus stuff.\nAs it relates to your second question around the AI play, I think that, look, these AI networks that are being built, whether it's in web scale or whether we have some of our largest enterprise customers that are building AI networks and training AI algorithms, these are in the web scale space, they're bigger than the core infrastructure networks that they're running, which was astonishing to me when I learned that. The network performance required is three to four times what they've historically needed. This is a massive opportunity for us, and we're in active discussions with lots of customers around it. We do think that this shift is going to create a good opportunity for us in the future.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you. Very helpful.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong guide. Maybe if I can just quickly hit on two of the product areas. Firstly, security. What sort of benefits are you seeing given your broad portfolio there in terms of customers looking to maybe some level of vendor consolidation, just given your position as more of a broader security portfolio supplier? What sort of benefits as supply eases, maybe on the firewall side, should we expect relative to revenue growth? A similar question on internet for the future, internet of the future segment seems like a bit more supply constrained than other segments. What are you seeing on the supply side there? Thank you. Okay. I'll take security, and you take the supply side just out of interview.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI think that, look, all of our customers definitely want to consolidate their security infrastructure. They've got 40, 50 different vendors, and trying to correlate these threats is very difficult, and you can't add enough people. Our teams right now are heads down working on some new capabilities that we're going to be bringing out over the next 12 to 18 months. Some of that is focused on exactly that. How do we consolidate, and how do we create the ability to correlate threats in real time much more effectively? We think that you're probably going to start seeing the benefit of that three, four quarters out. Teams got work to do. We've hired a significant amount of outside talent, and we've invested heavily in this space.\nWhile we may not see the growth that you want to see in the near-term, you will see this begin to accelerate in FY 2024. I think that we're playing the long game here and really believe that there's a lot of consolidation that we can drive over the next few years. Scott?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Internet for the Future, Samik. It is one of the spaces. We've worked so hard and done so much across our entire product portfolio, and we've made great progress in many cases. I would say Internet for the Future is one of the spaces where we've improved lead times there, but we're still not back to more normal lead times in that space.\nWhat I'd also say, though, is we have already picked up orders just in the last several weeks from some of our peers that are also selling into that same space who couldn't meet demand, and those orders came to us instead. While it's a space we continue to work on, and while we're seeing improvement, it's not where we want it to be. I feel like we're performing pretty well on the supply side of Internet for the Future.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nAll right, that wraps up our Q&A. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nWell, first off, I just want to thank everybody for spending time with us today, and also really thank our teams. They delivered on very strong results.\nI want to thank the supply chain and our engineering teams for quarter after quarter after quarter of hard work and redesigns, over 100 product redesigns, aggressive actions to get us to the position we're in today. The entire company for the progress we've made on our business transformation. I'll just leave you with our feeling that our demand has remained stable. The business transformation is contributing significantly. Our backlog, all of those give us the visibility and confidence in the future. I think the relevance of our portfolio, given the most pressing needs of our customers, is at as high as it's been in a very long time. I'm super proud of what our teams have accomplished. Look forward to talking to you in the future, and thanks for joining us today.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2023 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, 17 May 2023 at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Cisco Investor Relations Group, and we thank you very much for joining today's call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for participating on today's conference call.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Q1 Fiscal Year 2023 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.\nIncome statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2023.\nThey are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2023, delivering strong results exceeding the top end of our guidance range for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS.\nWe delivered the largest quarterly revenue in our history, driven by excellent execution and the actions our team took to remediate our supply challenges. Given these results, along with the strength of our orders, our visibility, and easing supply constraints, we are raising our full-year outlook, which Scott will cover later. While we are proactively managing through an evolving and complex market environment, we remain intensely focused on executing on our strategy, including our transition to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. We achieved Software Revenue growth of 5% year-over-year, and Software Subscription revenue grew 11%. The easing of supply constraints and our ability to deliver hardware is now releasing software subscriptions that were sitting in backlog connecting to unshipped hardware. Our success is also reflected in our ARR, which exceeded $23 billion, increasing 7%, with product ARR growing 12%.\nWe also ended the quarter with RPO of nearly $31 billion, up 3% year-over-year, with product RPO up 5%. Over $16 billion of the RPO will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with a backlog that remains elevated at near-record levels. These metrics give us increased visibility and predictability and provide additional confidence in our ability to perform through the current market cycle. It also underscores our unique position, helping customers become more agile and resilient as they continue to navigate a complex set of challenges. As I've done in the past, I'd like to provide an update on supply chain before discussing our Q1 results. Like you've heard from others in the industry, we are encouraged by what we are seeing with modest improvement in certain component availability as shortages continue to ease from last quarter.\nThe redesign of many of our products has also helped bring supply stability and more resiliency. Over the last few quarters, you've heard me talk about the actions we've taken to navigate supply constraints. These actions are paying off and are contributing to our results. We now have greater visibility in the ramp of our customer product deliveries, which in turn gives us greater confidence in our fiscal 2023 outlook. Now, moving to performance highlights in the quarter, we delivered revenues of $13.6 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.86, our second highest quarterly non-GAAP EPS in the history of the company. We also generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $2 billion to our shareholders. These metrics show we remain committed to operating discipline and our balanced capital allocation priorities.\nWe are continuing to invest in our long-term growth opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders. In terms of our product orders in the quarter, it's important to note that the year-over-year comparison is against an unusually strong period of 34% growth in Q1 of fiscal year 2022. From a geographic perspective, we saw some emerging cautiousness in Europe. This is driven by a dramatic increase in energy costs and market volatility, which is leading customers to assess their overall spend. However, this also presents an opportunity for us as our technologies like IoT, Silicon One, and Power over Ethernet, drive a significant reduction in power consumption. To provide a normalized perspective, our Q4 to Q1 sequential growth was just slightly below the normal range over the last six years. It's also important to note that this was the second highest Q1 orders in the history of the company.\nWe have strong product revenue momentum in key parts of our business, including secure agile networks, security, and optimized application experiences. We also saw record performance from a number of products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless Meraki, ThousandEyes, and Duo. Networking is becoming increasingly critical to every organization, led by digital transformation, hybrid cloud, AI, and ML workloads. This is driving demand for our technologies. As we've discussed, there are also tailwinds to our business, such as hybrid work, 400Gb and beyond, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Security, and Full-Stack Observability. We believe these broader technology transitions will require every customer to re-architect their network infrastructure and, in turn, fuel long-term growth across our portfolio.\nAs I speak with customers, they tell me that while they are closely watching the economy, they remain focused on making the right investments across their business to increase their agility and drive greater innovation and productivity. In our WebSkill business, demand remains solid, driven by their growing investments with Cisco to build out AI fabric and massively scalable cloud networks. Once again, we saw strong momentum with our Silicon One ASICs Cisco 8000 routers. We are experiencing robust demand for our 400Gb products and now have nearly 1,200 customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, WebSkill orders were up double-digits or greater for the eighth consecutive quarter. Network capacity demand continues to increase, driven by 5G, IoT, pervasive video, and other technology trends I've mentioned earlier.\nWith our commitment to powering next-generation networks while also driving sustainability, we launched new 800Gb switching platforms built on our Silicon One G100 chip to help meet customers' demand for more programmability, bandwidth, and energy efficiency. Let me now touch on our innovation, as I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have come together to deliver market-leading solutions for our customers. Security and hybrid work are now more critical than ever. We continue to extend our capabilities to enable customers to work more securely anywhere while reducing cost and complexity. In security, we introduced new data loss prevention, firewall, and zero trust capabilities across our portfolio, and in collaboration, we announced more than 40 new innovations to power hybrid work and deliver exceptional customer experiences. We're also committed to giving our customers more choice.\nAn example of this is our partnership with Microsoft to bring Microsoft Teams to Cisco meeting room devices. By doing this, we are driving interoperability and demonstrating our openness to meet our customers' need and provide greater flexibility. To wrap up, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth. The strength of orders, increased visibility, and easing supply situation provides us with enhanced visibility and predictability, which underpins the confidence we have in our business and our increased outlook for the year. Our performance this quarter is a testament to our innovation and execution to support our customers during these complex times. Additionally, it reinforces Cisco's strength, durability, and discipline in how we manage the business while investing to capture the multi-year growth opportunities ahead.\nOur portfolio is in great shape, and our business model is resilient, with 43% of our revenue now recurring, which is very important as we navigate the current macro environment. The hard work and dedicated commitment of our leadership team and employees over the last few years to transform our business model is reflected in the performance we delivered this quarter. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our position in the market, we have an excellent foundation for delivering long-term results. I will now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1, reflecting solid execution and discipline management. We had record total revenue of $13.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, driven by product shipment levels above our expectations and continued improvements in component supply.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 31.8%, down 150 basis points, in line with our guidance range, primarily driven by higher component costs as well as logistics costs related to supply constraints. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, up 5%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 8%, and service revenue was flat at $3.4 billion. Within product revenue, secure agile networks performed well, up 12%. Switching revenue grew with double-digit growth in campus switching, driven by growth in our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. While data center switching modestly declined, we saw solid growth in our Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing declined primarily from the product transition to our Catalyst 8000 series routers, along with constrained supply.\nWireless had very strong double-digit growth, driven primarily by our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the Future was down 5%, driven by declines in cable, optical, and edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and strong double-digit growth in WebScale. Collaboration was down 2%, driven by a decline in meetings, partially offset by growth in calling. End-to-end security was up 9%, driven by unified threat management and zero trust offerings. Our zero trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences was up 7%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.2 billion, which increased 7%, with product ARR growth of 12%.\nTotal Software Revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of 5%, with Software Subscription Revenue up 11%. 85% of the Software Revenue was subscription-based, which is up 5 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to have over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. Total Subscription Revenue was $5.9 billion, an increase of 6%. Total Subscription Revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was up $30.9 billion, up 3%. Product RPO increased 5%, and service RPO increased 1%. Total short-term RPO grew to $16.4 billion. In terms of orders in Q1, we had the second highest Q1 orders in our history. Although product orders were down 14% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that they compare against 34% growth from a year ago. We continue to have low cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels.\nLooking at our geographic segments year-on-year, the Americas was down 10%, EMEA was down 23%, and APJC down 10%. In our customer markets, service provider was down 23%, commercial was down 14%, enterprise was down 13%, and public sector was down 7%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in within our guidance range at 63%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 61%, down 280 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 230 basis points. In our product gross margin, the decrease was primarily driven by both component costs as well as higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraints. This was partially offset by strong positive pricing impact as a result of the actions we took in the prior year, as well as some benefit from product mix. Backlog levels for both our hardware and software continue to far exceed historical levels.\nAs we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to increase our shipments this quarter, resulting in about a 10% decrease in total backlog sequentially, which remains at the second highest level we've seen. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.9 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $19.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $4 billion, up 16% year-over-year. In capital allocation, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases.\nAll of this is in line with our long-term objective of returning a minimum of 50% of Free Cash Flow annually to our shareholders. We also ended the quarter with $14.7 billion in Stock Repurchase Authorizations. To summarize, we executed well in Q1, in a highly complex environment, delivering better-than-expected top-line growth and non-GAAP profitability. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Consistent with that objective, we announced some restructuring actions focused on prioritizing our investments across our highest growth opportunities and right-sizing our real estate footprint to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to our financial guidance for Q2, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63% to 64.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to 0.86. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance is we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5 year-on-year. This is up from the prior range of 4% to 6 growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.51 to 3.58, also up 4.5% to 6.5 year-on-year. In both our Q2 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our Q2 guidance reflects the increased visibility we have from our significant backlog and the RPO we have built up with our business model transformation, as well as the easing of supply constraints.\nThe full-year guidance rolls forward our Q1 overperformance with a prudent view of the remainder of the year. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nCybersecurity, Network and Equipment Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. Chuck, I was just wondering if you could dive a little bit more into kind of the commentary that you gave about Europe, and just also kind of what you were seeing in terms of level of activity, or level of approvals needed within the US that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Meta. Yeah, we saw Europe is obviously being impacted by the energy costs, and I think that's just forcing companies to take a look at their P&L, as you would have to, and where they spend their dollars. And we continue to see it not be quite as cold there. We had conversations with some of our team members this week, which is a positive sign. But the other thing that I called out that I think is an important one is that customers are trying to solve this energy cost issue in a very aggressive way. And we have several technology areas that can help them do that, including our Silicon One Technology, which powers their networks at much lower power consumption.\nYou've got IoT, where we can connect these energy systems and make them more efficient, as well as power over Ethernet, which actually just reduces the power footprint for our customers. So it does also create some opportunity. I'd say if I go to Asia real quick, you've got Asia was actually pretty resilient. They're clearly aware of the economic situation that's going on, but we had five regions last quarter that were positive after big positive a year ago, including India, which grew significantly after significant growth the prior year. So that was a good sign. So Asia is pretty resilient, it feels like, right now. And then in the America, I'd say it's a little mixed. We have some customers who are powering forward and other customers who are taking a little cautious outlook.\nWe think by December, we'll have better visibility to the 2023 budgets, which will be helpful. And to your question about more signatures, we have seen our customers have implemented greater signature requirements, but by and large, the deals that we have going are getting signed. They're just taking a little bit longer than we expect.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nCybersecurity, Network and Equipment Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nTal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, guys. Thanks so much. Great quarter, and I see that the numbers are going up, but the question is how much of it is backlog flush, and how much of it is the environment? Meaning, I look at your product growth. Product orders, it's down 14%. Last quarter, it's down 6%. And the question is, how is the environment itself? Is the environment weakening from orders, bookings, backlog?\nIs the environment weakening, and what we're seeing is acceleration because of supply constraints that are easing, or is the environment holding up? And maybe you can refer to some of your big product categories to see how the trends are. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks, Tal. So this is a question we expected, so I'm going to give you a little more detail than I probably normally would. First off, the two quarters we just finished, and the next quarter, we have massive year-over-year comparisons from a prior year. So as we discussed last time, we think it's more important to look at sequential growth as an indicator. And as I said, we were slightly below our historic quarter-to-quarter range, roughly a percent, so it wasn't significant, not completely out of line. Certainly a little lighter than we would expect normally, but not significant.\nEnterprise and commercial on a global basis were both within the normal sequential range. Public sector was slightly out of range, and service providers just lumpy. So the sequential reflection on service provider is not really valid. So demand was not it didn't fall off a cliff by any stretch. In fact, US Enterprise, after an upper 20s growth in the prior year, they actually posted low-single-digit positive growth again. So that was a positive sign. Our order linearity within the quarter was in line. And remember, it was our second largest Q1 orders ever. So the only quarter that was bigger was the quarter a year ago. So that's positive. Now, what you're trying to get at, and I think everybody's trying to get at, is this year being driven by backlog, and then as we go beyond that, everything falls apart.\nSo let me give you some data points on this. Even if our orders are down 10% this year, which is not our forecast, we will stilproject today, that we will end the fiscal year with two to three times our historic year-end normal backlog. That normal backlog is typically $4 to 5 billion. So I'm giving you actual numbers here. And then when you couple that with 43% of our revenue now coming from recurring, which is reflected in our RPO, that's what gives us a high degree of confidence and a high degree of visibility in the near term. So hopefully that helps you answer your question, Tal.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tal. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. So Chuck, maybe just as a point of clarification, you talked about the sequential decline. It was a little bit worse than seasonal, but you took down backlog by about 10%, looks like quarter-over-quarter. Can you just kind of help square those numbers? Because that sounds if I just say that you did about 13.1 last year in the Q4, you'd be a little bit below 12.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nDavid, I think we may have lost you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nHope it wasn't us. David, you there?\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nCan you guys hear me?\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNow we can.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nWe lost you there. You got cut off in the middle of your sentence.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nSorry about that. Yeah, just can you help square the backlog versus the sequential commentary?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, there are actually—\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nIf I look at your quarter-over-quarter backlog commentary, that was slightly below seasonal, but it sounds like you took down backlog by about 10%. It seems like there's about $600 or 700 million of revenue that we're going to kind of triangulate on. If you can kind of just walk through that, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure. Yeah, the backlog came down about 10%, leaving us with an ending backlog at the end of Q1 that was the second highest in our history and higher than what we had seen at the end of Q3. We took a spike up a little more than 10% in Q4 and came back down in Q1. What Chuck was talking about on the sequentials is really about the overall product bookings that came in versus where we're standing in backlog. The flow through of orders come in, drop in the backlog, and that backlog then converts into revenue.\nThe way you got to think about it is less about, does the change in backlog convert to revenue growth, and more of the, does the change in backlog convert to build? Remember, bookings contribute to both backlog and RPO.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Maybe just one final thing on profitability. When software comes out of backlog, I would imagine that would have been a tailwind for gross margins in the quarter. Can you kind of quantify what that might have been in the quarter, given obviously there's some supply chain pressure and logistics pressures on margin?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, you said it right. Longer term, the software component continuing to grow and us being able to ship that out of backlog will be a tailwind to margins. Right now, what we're shipping out of backlog is still a lot of aged product. We made great progress, by the way, on our aged backlog during the quarter, but a lot of what we're shipping out still is orders that were received prior to the price increases. You see two things happening at once. You see the higher cost and the revenues tied to pre-price increase sales at the same time, which obviously is a headwind to margins. At the same time, we see more software being shipped out, which is a tailwind. The net is it continues to be a pretty significant headwind. 61% product gross margin in the quarter, in line with what we had seen in Q4. The good news is we made good progress on shipping out a lot of that aged backlog.\nThere's still a little bit more to get out in Q2, and so I expect by the end of the year, margins to expand from where they are now, product margins to expand 50 to 75 basis points.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, Scott.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nIttai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nIttai Kidron (Oppenheim\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Analytics, Data, Security, and Infrastructure Software Secto\n\nThanks. Nice results. Chuck, I want to go back to your answer to Tal's question. It's very clear that with orders down and your ability to fulfill now much more enhanced, that the backlog over the next few quarters will just continue to decline. So help us get our hands around what would be a level of decline that would make you worry versus a level of decline that you'd think as a normal pace in going back to historical normal levels?\nWhat would be the line in the sand, would you say, where you would say, \"More than this, we probably have an issue, but if it's around X, then it's perfectly normal and reasonable that that will happen over the next 12, 18 months\"?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Ittai, we've actually modeled out various booking scenarios for the year, and it would have to be significantly worse than what I told you for it to be concerning. Scott, do you have any other comments?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, I think what you're trying to get at is when do we get back to more seasonal patterns, right? Obviously, seasonality went out the window, both going into the pandemic and then coming out of it with those three consecutive quarters of north of 30% growth. We are beginning to see signs of normal seasonality returning.\nIt's going to be a little complex to see, though, because as supply constraints loosen up, we'll be able to reduce lead times. We've already done that for a handful of product lines, and as we do that, of course, that will have an effect on just the current period booking. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for you to spot those trends over the next few quarters as lead times normalize.\n\nIttai Kidron (Oppenheim\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Analytics, Data, Security, and Infrastructure Software Secto\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nTim Long from Barclays, you may go ahead.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Yeah, two quick ones if I could. Maybe Chuck on the Cloud Vertical, could you talk a little bit, still talking double-digit orders there? Could you kind of just parse out the deceleration in terms of maybe just normalization of extra quarters of ordering versus potential for there's been a lot of talk of normalization of spend by the cloud players next year? If you could kind of parse those two out. On the software side, just curious if you can update us. It sounds like a lot of hardware converted, which helped. Could you talk a little bit about kind of 9K renewals and maybe any of the other standalone software offerings that you think could also help that growth number the next few quarters? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, two good questions, Tim. On the Cloud Vertical, I think you're calling out the right thing that the normalization of the orders is going to probably occur over the next few quarters. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see our trailing four-quarter rates over the next couple of quarters maybe even dip negative because of so much ordering ahead that we've seen. But we continue to see real strong demand in general from them. We've done a great deal of long-term planning with them. We have some number of orders that aren't even in book that don't even show up in bookings yet because they're out past our bookings lead time window. So that's positive. So we continue to see success there. We continue to win franchises, and we feel good about where we are there. On the software side, what I would say is that the 9K renewals are improving. They're still not material right now. I think next year we'll see that occur.\nWhat we did announce this past year is that we are going to manage all of the Catalyst portfolio under the Meraki dashboard, the Meraki platform, and that will be delivered to our customers who have the DNA license and the premium license. So we think that in itself, we've already launched the monitoring capability there, and the management we think will even improve our renewals beyond that. But as we said, we had a record quarter for Catalyst 9K, so we're real happy with how it's performing. Scott?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, what I'd add to that, Tim, is if you're looking at software growth, bear in mind the software subscription growth, the subscription subset of our total software grew 11%, and it's now 85% of the total. Obviously, with the total only growing 5%, there was a continued decline in perpetual as part of the software license.\nOur software revenue, it's now 15% of our total. So I think we're getting to a point where the subscription base is getting significantly larger than what's in perpetual, and that headwind on perpetual will be less of an impact on us going forward.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Tim. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nPaul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen and Company\n\nI appreciate you taking the question. At the risk of asking something you can't or will not respond to, Scott, I was hoping to ask you back to the margin question, two related questions. One, well, just for clarification, the 50 to 75 basis point product margin improvement, I assume that's off of the current quarter. Is that the reference point?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, 50 to 75 off the current quarter. That's right. By the time we get to Q4.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen and Company\n\nAll right. Now for the subsequent questions. Longer term, and I recognize there's a lot of moving pieces in this tough environment to predict, but longer term, can you get back to or even exceed the almost 67% growth and 34% operating margin from early 2021? Your gross margin was a 15-year high. Your operating margin, you'd have to go back to 1997, I think, the last time you put up that type of number. Obviously, you're far off those numbers, as is everybody else, from what they were doing a year and a half ago pre-pandemic. But where do you think you could get back to long-term? And related to that, what are your expectations, your plans for growing OpEx? I assume you want to drive some degree of leverage and definitive gross margin. Any thoughts you can share? The OpEx growth this quarter, I think, was 4% or 5.\nIt strikes me as a little bit high. But any thoughts in terms of what your thoughts are going forward?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nSure. Let me take the gross margin piece of that first. There's a couple of moving parts, as you know, Paul, inside the gross margins. One is the backlog, some of which is still sitting at pre-price increase levels. We'll get that shipped out as we work our way through that part of the backlog. Obviously, that'll be a tailwind. The increasing component of software built into our revenues will be a tailwind. Will it get back to 65%? I think for that to happen, we'll have to see either further cost reductions on the input side between freight and logistics, which we are beginning to see. While they're up year on year, sequentially, we're beginning to see some signs of easing in freight and logistics costs as well.\nBut we'll have to see that, and we'll have to see a further reduction in component cost and/or price increase. So I think it's, without giving you a quantified number, I think there's a number of moving parts inside there. More tailwinds as we look ahead than there are headwinds on that. On the OpEx side, part of what you see in this quarter, of course, is the normalization of our bonus plans. Last year, bonus plan obviously didn't pay out so well. As we go into this year and you normalize that, that's part of the OpEx growth. We did have a slightly bigger than normal annual merit increase cycle. That's driving some of the OpEx growth as well. I think our focus longer term is, which you've heard me say, it's balanced profitable growth, right?\nIf you look at our guide for the year, 4.5% to 6.5 growth on the top line, 4.5% to 6.5 on the bottom line. Long-term, we talked about 5% to 7 top line, 5% to 7 bottom line. I think that's really the way you need to think about it.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen and Company\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nGeorge Notter with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\n\nGeorge Notter\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Communications Equipment, Jefferies\n\nHi guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the impact of foreign exchange. Obviously, US dollar at 20-year highs. Maybe you can talk about how you're broaching that conversation with customers internationally. Are you seeing any diminishment of demand? What's the picture? Thanks a lot.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, I'll start with the numbers on that, George. And I'm sure you know this. We sell about 90% of our revenue denominated in USD. So there's not a big translation impact to us for the strength of the dollar. It's not insignificant, but it gets offset by the benefit we get on the OpEx line. So FX to us from a translation standpoint really hasn't had a material impact. As we look at it now, you're selling in USD with an elevated exchange rate to the dollar, there's no question that is having a bit of an impact. Certainly, one of the things contributing to what Chuck talked about earlier, that we're seeing in Europe, not only are they battling high inflation in their own markets, but that increased cost in local currency to transact has been a bit of a headwind. But we've dealt with this. We've sold in USD through the entire history of the company, not expecting it to be something that has a lasting impact on us.\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nLet's go ahead and take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAmit Daryanani from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nYes, Chuck. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, I guess maybe the first one, I hope you could touch on the service provider market. I think you said auto is down 23%. That seems a bit more severe than the rest of the portfolio. Can you just touch on what's happening there, and anything you'd flag service provider versus web scale would be helpful?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nI couldn't understand the question.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nCan you repeat the question?\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nYeah. Sorry. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the service provider auto decline of 23%. Seems a bit more severe than the rest of the business. Anything over there between web scale and kind of the traditional service providers would be helpful.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Amit, thank you for that. And I think the reality around that one is simply if you go back a year ago, that segment grew 65%. I think that's the fundamental issue. I don't think there's anything else going on.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nGot it. And maybe you could just ask you this about the full year guide that we use for folks who are validated, right? So you just did 6% growth against a very difficult compare. And I get the raised full year guide, but you aren't really assuming much of an acceleration for the rest of the year despite compares getting easier. So I guess, Chuck, is that just being conservative, or are you seeing signs in your backlog or your orders that give you a pause on that? Because given how easy the compares get, I would imagine the growth would accelerate a bit for the year.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, there's nothing that's giving us pause in that. I mean, we guided up the full year in revenue from what had been a guide of 4% to 6 growth to 4.5% to 6.5. That effectively rolls forward the outperformance that we had in Q1 into the full year. There's no change in the way we're looking at the second half of the year, either ±, but it's a prudent view of what we expect in the next three quarters.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nSimon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director of Data Infrastructure, Raymond James\n\nThank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if there was some way you could characterize your own lead time. So if you had customers placing orders today for Meraki products or campus switches or data center gear, what are the lead times for getting the product for your customers, and how does that compare to the prior quarter and prior year? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, I'll make some comments. And Scott, if you want to add some color, feel free. The range on the products is very wide right now. We still have a couple of product areas that we have component issues that we're doing some work, and I think we've got probably one more quarter before we start improving those. We've got other products like we have certain firewalls that are down to three-week lead times. We have some of the products we've redesigned that I've talked about before that went from 40 weeks to 12 weeks and will continue to improve.\nI think we made improvements in roughly half of the portfolio, half of the product families improved during the last quarter, and we would expect to continue that progress as we move forward.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director of Data Infrastructure, Raymond James\n\nAnd just as a quick follow-up, as you're showing improvement, do you see that affecting your ability to maintain or take market share where perhaps you were more vulnerable when the lead times were more extended?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, I think the whole market share discussion is reflected in our backlog. I mean, that's the issue. And as we ship it, you will see us, I think you'll see us over the next 12 months gain market share as we have an outsized backlog that we'll be delivering. So I would expect that to have a positive impact.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director of Data Infrastructure, Raymond James\n\nThank you very much.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Simon. Next question.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nJames Fish with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Fish\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Technology, Digital Infrastructure, and Connectivity Software, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, thanks for the question. On the restructuring plan, I know these things are never easy, and we had picked up that the collaboration side was seeing some layoffs. But what product areas are being most hit? How should we think about the reduction of headcount here overall? What's the strategy to change the direction of some of these growth businesses around that have been kind of struggling to grow? And by that, I really mean the collaboration side. And how much are you guys factoring this kind of impact into the top line here on guide? Thanks.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, so we're actually speaking to our employees tomorrow about this. So I'd be reluctant to go into a lot of detail here until we're able to talk to them. I would say that what we're doing is right-sizing certain businesses. We're really focused on resources moving into an Enterprise Networking Space, accelerating our platform strategy. We will be making significant investments in security and beefing up our team there and the capacity to continue to innovate there. Those are important areas. And so if you would understand, I'd prefer to wait and talk to our employees tomorrow about it. But you can just assume that we're not actually—there's nothing that's a lower priority, but we are right-sizing certain businesses. And since you asked about collab, I'll tell you a little bit about what we see: incredible strength right now in our calling business, our cloud calling business. We see great strength in our cloud contact center business. And the compares on the meeting side are going to start to give us the ability for that to be a much more favorable component.\nSo I actually am optimistic over the next 12 months about our collaboration portfolio. The team has done an amazing job. I truly believe that they built the best platform in the business. And when you look at our devices and the interoperability that the team has been driving with the Microsoft interoperability, that is a huge, huge thing from a customer perspective for us to give them that flexibility. So I think they've done a good job, and I feel pretty good about that business as we go forward. We just need to right-size some of the OpEx. And James, to be clear, don't think of this as an headcount action that is motivated by cost savings. This really is a rebalancing. As we look across the board, there are areas that we would like to invest in more.\nChuck just talked about them: security, our move to platforms, and more cloud-delivered products. But we're also going to maintain our financial discipline as we do that. And so this is about just rebalancing across the board. In a perfect world, you'd have a 100% skill match, and you could take the people in the areas or the skills in certain areas and just move them to where we need to invest. And unfortunately, that's not a perfect world. But we do have a,if you look at the number of jobs that we have open in the areas that we're trying to invest, it is just slightly lower than the number of people that we believe will be impacted. And we're going to be working really hard to help match our employees to those roles to the extent there's a skill match.\nSo we're going to work really hard at that.\n\nJames Fish\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Technology, Digital Infrastructure, and Connectivity Software, Piper Sandler\n\nIf I could just follow up quickly on that, appreciate the color there, guys, and understand the sensitivity you guys want to have. In terms of that $600 million hit though, Scott, should we expect that to actually be the net savings as a result, or is that going to the net savings actually going to be lower because you're kind of repositioning some folks?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, it's really not motivated by cost savings. So the net, by the time we get to the end of the year, our expectation is we have about the same headcount that we had at the beginning of the year. But there's two pieces to this. One is what we've been speaking about just now about the headcount impact. There's a second piece of this that's really about right-sizing our real estate portfolio.\nAnd we've got a long tail of small offices distributed around the world that are significantly underutilized and, in fact, unused in some cases. So the second piece of that charge, there will be two elements to it. One that's people-related. The second piece will be about right-sizing our real estate portfolio. That will generate some savings, not much in fiscal 2023, but longer term, that will generate some savings.\n\nJames Fish\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Technology, Digital Infrastructure, and Connectivity Software, Piper Sandler\n\nHelpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong brand. I guess I just had one. I think if I could go back to the Chuck, your comments about seeing hesitation from EMEA customers a bit more given the macro-backdrop there. And you spoke about the opportunities that you see at the same time.\nMaybe if I can ask you, when you are seeing the hesitation from the customers there, how are you seeing them prioritize across your portfolio when it comes to data center versus campus versus security as they're reevaluating their spend or hesitating in that sense? How are they prioritizing within your portfolio and which areas are getting impacted by that? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems",
    "content2": "Yeah, Samik, it's a good question. And I would say the first thing I would say is that Gartner recently came out with a survey of executives in our customer base, and almost half of them said that their technology investments would be the last thing they cut. So that's just a backdrop for, I think, how important customers view their technology investments these days.\nWhen we look at where customers are investing, many of them are investing to—they're moving forward with their hybrid work investments, right, and creating the infrastructure that they need to deal with this new world. We see customers continuing—we saw a recent survey that talked about customers who are balancing their private cloud and public cloud workloads. And so the whole re-architecture of the infrastructure to deal with these new traffic patterns is another area. I mentioned in Europe with the power, with the energy costs, there's a lot of focus. IoT has just been accelerating over the last two to three years. And we saw another—I think we had a record bookings quarter in Q1, I believe it was really strong where customers are really looking to connect these systems to actually optimize their power consumption and their efficiency.\nAnd again, we see a lot of customers who are moving, who are doing greenfield real estate projects that are really focused on reducing, going to low voltage architectures, which leads them to power over Ethernet, which leads them to rebuilding their infrastructure. And then you've got cybersecurity, and you've got full stack observability. We continue to see 5G buildouts. There are just lots of—there's a lot of positive tailwinds, notwithstanding the short-term dynamic environment that we're in.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you. I think we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nSami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you very much. Chuck, I wanted to go back to a comment you made regarding market share and some of that sitting in the backlog. Now, if we assumed that there was nothing in the backlog and all the numbers that you generated were publicly reported through your financial statements, would that show that Cisco actually maintained or increased or even lost market share?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYou mean if all our backlog was actually shipped and reported?\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nCorrect.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I think that would be true. I mean, look, we operate in lots of different markets. So is it true 100% of the markets? That'd be difficult for me to say. But I believe that as we ship out the—particularly our secure agile networks, our enterprise networking products, that's certainly going to help. As we catch up on our data center infrastructure, I think that's going to help. There's also just reporting dynamics that occur. Some of our competitors report certain routing products into data center switching, and we've reported into routing, which makes it difficult to ascertain.\nSo it's an imperfect science on top of that. But I do believe that as our backlog unwinds and gets back to normal levels over the next 18, 24 months, then I think that you'll see—I think you will see that dynamic.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Just to be clear, that is Cisco gain share? I don't know. Just to make sure I heard you correctly.\nI think that's right. In certain key areas. I mean, not perhaps across every one. I'd have to go do the analysis. But in some of the key ones that I know all of you are worried about, the answer is yes.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nIn our bigger markets.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nIn the bigger markets.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. And then one question just for Scott. So Scott, maybe you could tell us where in fiscal Q1 of 2023 did shipments begin to start accelerating? Just because we want to kind of understand the trend here going from now through fiscal Q4 and putting into that product gross margin comment into perspective. What I'm really trying to understand is as shipments start to accelerate, how much will software attach to those shipments? Just so I can understand the glide path here of what happens in some of the other segments outside of just secure network, agile networks, etc., right? I'm just trying to get this kind of this pull dynamic that may occur from the other segments related to shipments going out the door.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nGot it. Yeah. So we talked about the overall backlog reduction at about 10% from Q4 to where we ended Q1. A subset of that, of course, is software. That same percent held pretty much true in software. Software continues to be well over $2 billion of our overall product backlog.\n\nOperator\n\nIt's actually about the same reduction sequentially as we saw in overall backlog, so right around the 10% rate. I think as you look ahead and try to model out the 50 to 75 basis points of improvement that I talked about, I think it's going to be probably a little bit heavier in the second half of the year than it will be in the second quarter. You saw the guide for the second quarter.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nYep. Got it. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nI'll turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman of the Board and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Marilyn. Thank you all for joining us today. I just want to reiterate, we feel like we had a very strong quarter, largest quarterly revenue in history. As I said earlier, the orders, the visibility, the easing in supply chain gives us the confidence to raise the year, obviously. We're very focused.\nWe're managing the business for growth. We are going to go through this process of reinvesting into strategic areas. The people impact is difficult. I just want our employees who are listening in today to know that this afternoon and tomorrow we'll be communicating about how we're going to go about this. It's always a difficult decision, but we have a lot of opportunity. I'm very optimistic about the future. I'm proud of the teams and what they've accomplished, and really excited about the visibility and the confidence that we have in the near term. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to next time.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.\nCisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I'll now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThank you, Marilyn, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm very proud to share that we had a strong end to our fiscal year in the midst of an incredibly dynamic environment. In fact, we set several records with our performance this year. Let me first touch on those. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $3.36, record product orders, which fueled our backlog to the highest level ever recorded, as well as our second strongest year of revenue in the history of the company at $51.6 billion. We continue to see strong customer adoption of our software and subscriptions, driven by the targeted investments we've been making.\nWe also had record net income, which reflects our operating discipline despite external challenges, including supply chain and inflation. Our ongoing business transformation continues to show progress across our KPIs, with annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, both setting record highs. These important metrics illustrate the increasing recurring nature of our revenue streams. This, combined with our record backlog, provides us with enhanced visibility into our business looking forward. While this was certainly a complex year, we executed well. I want to thank our teams for their perseverance, determination, and unwavering commitment to our customers and our partners. Our team's commitment to accelerated innovation has put us in a unique position of strength for fiscal 2023 and over the long term. Now, I want to be clear on our outlook for fiscal 2023.\nWe expect strong performance across our portfolio, driven by our continued focus on innovation and easing of supply constraints to drive solid top-line growth and profitability. While we anticipated some moderation from the unprecedented product order growth of last year, demand signals remain solid. We do expect to continue to experience higher costs in the short-term, driven primarily by higher component, rate, and logistics cost, which is reflected in our Q1 guide. However, as you'll see in our annual guidance, we expect this margin pressure to begin to ease as the year progresses. Long-term, there are many multi-year growth opportunities ahead of us that give me confidence in our future. There are currently more technology transitions occurring concurrently than I've seen in 20 years.\nLong-term mega trends like hybrid cloud, hybrid work, security, IoT, 400 GB and beyond, 5G, and Wi-Fi 6, as well as the move towards application observability, will likely provide tailwinds to our growth. With our portfolio in such a strong position to help our customers, I'm quite optimistic about what's ahead. Before we discuss the quarter in detail, I want to provide some additional color on the supply situation and how we continue to build greater resiliency. After a challenging April due to the COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai and the impact on semiconductor and power supplies, overall supply constraints began to ease slightly at the back half of the fourth quarter and continuing into the start of Q1. While the component supply headwinds remain, they have begun to show early signs of easing.\nThe decisions we made and the multiple actions we have taken over the past two years are helping to improve our resiliency and will help offset cost inflation. These include adding new suppliers, leveraging alternative suppliers, redesigning hundreds of products to use alternative components with similar capability, and targeted price increases, all of which position us for the future. These actions, along with the tremendous efforts by our supply chain team and the investments we've made in building capacity to meet growth, have the potential to drive momentum into fiscal 2023. Moving to performance highlights in the quarter, we delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS came in at the high end of our guidance range. We achieved healthy operating margins, generated solid cash flow, and returned nearly $4 billion to Cisco stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWith annual product order growth of 14% for the fiscal year, we exited the year with record product backlog. In addition, our RPO totaled more than $31 billion, and when combined with low cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels, this sets the stage for increased visibility and strong revenue growth as we head into fiscal 2023. In terms of our product orders this quarter, we delivered the second highest orders in absolute dollars in the history of the company. It was second only to our performance in Q4 of fiscal 2021, and on a sequential basis, it was up greater than 15%, with strong growth in enterprise, commercial, and public sector. From an annual growth rate perspective, we clearly face some very tough comparisons from the record orders we saw in Q4 last year, where we had over 30% growth.\nBased on that, the year-over-year decline was not a surprise, nor is it concerning. It's important to keep in mind that in the near term, the rate and pace of our revenue growth is much more a function of component availability than on our quarterly product order growth. With RPO of over $31 billion, almost $17 billion of which will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, and a record backlog, we have great top-line visibility. Thanks to the relentless effort of our entire organization, the business remains stronger than before the pandemic. From a demand perspective, we continue to experience solid customer activity beyond our ability to deliver, as is reflected in the growth of our backlog that we saw throughout the quarter.\nWhile our business is not immune to macro trends, we will remain disciplined in our operations while benefiting from robust multi-year investment trends and the technology transitions I mentioned earlier. Our innovation is helping our customers and partners navigate an increasing amount of complexity, and there is a greater sense of urgency to leverage leading-edge technologies to deliver on their strategic objectives. This is leading them to consistently look to Cisco and our unique, differentiated innovation to help them advance their most pressing business priorities. We recently held our Cisco Live customer event in person for the first time in three years and had over 15,000 in attendance, including thousands of our largest customers, and many more participating virtually. Our discussions with them focused on strategic projects, supply assurance, and the critical role Cisco can play to support their long-term technology roadmaps.\nThey did not indicate any fundamental shift in their commitment to technology investments. Regardless of what the coming quarters may bring, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust in difficult environments. Our value proposition to our customers remains as strong as ever. In our web scale business, we continue to see momentum even as the business becomes larger, as product orders were up more than 50% on a trailing four-quarter basis. We see significant opportunity ahead as these customers build out massively scalable cloud networks and increasingly turn to Cisco to help them meet accelerating demand for cloud services. Our leadership in silicon, optics, software, and systems enables us to win as hyperscalers value industry-leading performance and innovation. We are expanding our footprint, driven by data center buildouts with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 Routers, the fastest-growing platforms in Cisco's history.\nTogether with optics from Acacia, we have a strong foundation for 400 GB and beyond to re-architect the internet with routed optical networking. In addition, we recently booked and shipped our first 800 GB systems to one of our web scale customers. On the IoT front, we also now have more than 200 million connected things on our cloud platform, with growth driven by connected car. We finished fiscal 2022 with product orders in excess of $1 billion and growing double digits. We continue to make progress on our transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue. ARR of approximately $23 billion was up 8%, with product ARR increasing by 13%. We had strong subscription revenue this quarter, driven by our growing portfolio of recurring offers.\nWhile our software revenue was down slightly, once supply constraints improve and we begin to increase product shipments, we expect to see an improvement in software, subscription, and services that are attached to hardware products in our backlog. The investments we've made in innovation are paying off, as our competitive position is very strong. In Q4, we introduced several new cloud-delivered innovations across our portfolio to help organizations drive productivity and resiliency. We launched Nexus Cloud, a platform to help our customers deploy, manage, and operate their data center networks from the cloud. In addition, we introduced Calisti and Panoptica, two new cloud-native API-first tools for faster and better application development. We also announced AppDynamics Cloud, a next-generation version of our observability platform for cloud-native applications.\nIn addition, we shared our strategy to help our customers connect their entire security architecture with our new platform, Cisco Security Cloud, which will be a game changer for them as they look to secure their multi-cloud environments with a single cloud-delivered security platform. This is just one part of our broader security innovation cycle. Building on the double-digit growth we saw in security this quarter, we are investing across our security business, focusing on cloud-based offerings, best-in-class AI-driven threat detection, and end-to-end security architectures. These innovations position us well for leadership in the security market. In summary, we executed well on our strategy and transformation during what remains a very dynamic time. This led to a strong close to our fiscal year, setting several records across our business thanks to the solid execution from our teams, our market-leading innovation, and our continued growth of recurring revenue.\nWe also took decisive actions to help offset inflation and build resiliency in our supply chain while investing in our business to position us well for long-term growth. The power of our technology continues to be a critical driver of economic growth and productivity. Our results and outlook demonstrate the critical role that Cisco plays as a leader in bringing innovative technology solutions to customers today and into the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain guided by our purpose-led culture and deeply committed to delivering value for our customers, partners, and investors, as well as continuing to be an amazing place to work for our employees. I will now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll first provide some detail on our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year, followed by our guidance. Our overall Q4 results reflect strong execution in an environment with continuing supply constraints and, as Chuck mentioned, increased costs reflected in our gross margins. We're very pleased that our shipment levels were above our expectations and that total revenue of $13.1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range, as we saw improvement in supply as a direct result of the numerous actions we've taken over multiple quarters. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%, down 110 basis points, and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q4 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.7 billion, and service revenue was $3.4 billion, both flat year-over-year. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks was down 1%.\nSwitching declined in both data center and campus, driven by supply constraints. We saw growth in our Catalyst 9000, Nexus 9000, and Meraki switching offerings. Enterprise routing declined, primarily driven by edge and SD-WAN, offset by strength in access. Wireless had strong growth, driven primarily by our Meraki wireless offerings. We also had double-digit growth in servers. Internet for the future was down 10%, with strength in web scale revenue offset by declines in cable, edge, and optical. Collaboration was up 2%, driven by growth in collaboration devices, partially offset by declines in our meetings and calling offerings. End-to-end security had record revenue, with strong growth of 20%, driven by strength across the entire portfolio. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences had solid growth of 8%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes.\nWe continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $22.9 billion, an increase of 8%, with product ARR growth of 13%, driven by several large software transactions closing during the quarter. Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 2%, with software subscription revenue up 1%. Bear in mind we continue to have well over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog. 83% of the software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year over year. Total subscription revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue. RPO was $31.5 billion, up 2%. Product RPO increased 6%, service RPO decreased 1%, and our total short-term RPO grew 4% to $16.9 billion.\nTotal product orders in Q4 were the second highest in our history. While product orders were down 6% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that they compare against 31% growth a year ago, which was the highest product orders in our history. On a sequential basis, product order growth was up over 15%, with double-digit growth in enterprise, commercial, and public sector. Looking at our geographic segments year over year, the Americas was down 9%, EMEA down 4%, and APJC up 1%. In our customer markets, enterprise was down 15%, public sector was down 3%, service provider was down 7%, and commercial was up 1%. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in at 63.3%, down 230 basis points year on year. Product gross margin was 61.3%, down 370 basis points, and service gross margin was 69%, up 160 basis points.\nIn our product gross margin, higher component and commodity costs, as well as higher freight and logistics related to supply constraints, were the predominant drivers of lower-than-expected margins. We saw increased benefits from the pricing actions we have taken, as well as from mix. Once again, we had a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software, well beyond our normal historical levels. As Chuck said, our ending product backlog was a record for the year. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of the $31.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. It's important to note that the combined total of our backlog and RPO gives us great visibility into our fiscal 2023 top-line growth. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $19.3 billion.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 18% year over year, primarily driven by advanced payments and inventory purchases to secure future supply. In capital allocation, we returned $4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which comprised $2.4 billion of share repurchases, and $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Turning to the full fiscal year results, overall, our financial results were solid in a year where we faced significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs, and the war in Ukraine. Our financial performance was highlighted by strong demand, with product order growth of 14%, including two quarters of truly impressive 33% growth, though our performance was clearly impacted by the supply constraints. Revenue was $51.6 billion, up 3%, while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4% at $3.36.\nIn terms of our software and metrics, total software revenue was flat at $15.1 billion, with the product portion up 2%. 81% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 2 percentage points year on year. Total subscription revenue was $22.4 billion, an increase of 2%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, down 150 basis points, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.6%, up 10 basis points. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $14.1 billion, up 3%. We delivered operating cash flow of $13.2 billion, down 14% compared to fiscal 2021, driven primarily by advanced payments for inventory purchases to secure component supply. While these payments had a negative impact on full-year operating cash flow, these and our other related actions helped to improve the supply situation in Q4 and future quarters.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $14 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases, representing 109% of our free cash flow. This was comprised of $7.7 billion of share repurchases, and $6.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends. We also increased our dividend for the 11th consecutive year in fiscal 2022, reinforcing our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. Our strong balance sheet and overall financial position is clearly a competitive advantage in tough environments. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and had a solid fiscal year in a highly complex environment, while continuing to make progress on our business model shift and making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets.\nThe demand for our products and services is strong as we drive innovation through continued investment and the shift to more recurring revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Turning to our financial guidance for Q1, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2%-4%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63%-64%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5%-32.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.82-$0.84. For fiscal 2023, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4%-6% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.49-$3.56, also up 4%-6% year-on-year.\nIn both our Q1 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the list of Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\n\nSami Badri\n\nResearch Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nHi, thank you. I actually had two questions. First thing is, for fiscal year 2023, your revenue growth expectations came in a bit stronger than most street expectations. Maybe you could just walk us through the composition of the segments, what's driving the strength, and maybe which segments may potentially lag some of the stronger segments. My other question is, maybe you could just give us some color on the composition of gross margin regarding pricing and productivity in fiscal Q4 of 2022. That'd be helpful.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, thanks, Sami. As we look at the forecast that we've given you for fiscal 2023, balance growth again, 4%-6% growth on the top line, 4%-6% growth on the bottom line. When you start to peel that back, of course, we don't guide at that level. What we have seen, as you'd expect, is, again, nice demand, as Chuck talked about on the call, through the end of the fourth quarter, but a little bit different by industry vertical. Retail, not surprisingly, under a little bit of pressure. Financial services, under a little bit of pressure. Pretty much strength across most of the rest of the sectors. A little bit of pressure in healthcare as well. As we roll into fiscal 2023, that's what we're seeing kind of vertical by vertical.\nWe saw good double-digit growth sequentially again, Q3 to Q4, because the year-on-year compares are quite difficult with that 31% growth we had a year ago. Good sequential growth, if you look at it by customer market in both enterprise, public sector, and commercial. Again, seeing pretty balanced growth across the board. That's our expectation as we roll into fiscal 2023. On the gross margin question, we are getting a benefit from price. One of the things that we've talked about, though, is there's a lag between the price increases that we've put in place and what we see actually showing up in reported revenues. I know you know this from prior quarters, Sami. We saw some of that benefit in Q4, and you'll see this in our filings, in our 10-K filing for the end of the quarter.\nIt's about 1% up year-on-year of gross margin, driven by price. The offset is coming from higher cost, both component costs, and freight and logistics.\n\nSami Badri\n\nResearch Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nTim Long with Barclays. You may go ahead.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you. Just wanted to ask on maybe two quick ones. One on the software business. Chuck, you talked about kind of flattish performance, but still carrying a lot of backlog there. That's been the case for a few quarters here. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you think it's going to take to get this business moving a little bit more aggressively towards that software model. I did want to follow up on the cloud vertical, still running really strong orders there. Can you talk a little bit about, is the breadth of portfolio shipping into that growing? I know the 8K is strong, but any other highlights of strength there, that would be great. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Tim. Let's start with the software. You're right, the software is flattish. There are two things that I would point out. We obviously have been transitioning from a perpetual software model, which is in decline, and that's by design. We want to decline our perpetual software and increase our subscription software. The way I would think about it is our perpetual was down roughly 14% during the quarter. We also, as Scott said, have over $2 billion, and it's actually a higher number exiting Q4 than it was in Q3, of software and backlog, as you said, connected to hardware. Those are two contributing factors, which is why we really should be thinking about the ARR situation, because that's reflective of the ACV that we basically had exiting the quarter. That's an indicator of future software revenue. We're comfortable with it.\nI think once we get through some of this supply chain stuff, that we'll start to see that be a little more reflective of what we've been planning on. On the cloud vertical, we continue to win new insertions. That business is approaching $3 billion annually now. After just two or three short years ago, it was pretty close to nothing, and so the teams have done a fantastic job. It is obviously over the last four quarters, it's grown 50%. From a revenue perspective, it's very supply chain dependent. I wouldn't get too wrapped up about the revenue versus the orders right now. I think we'll work our way through that over the next four to five quarters. Overall, really pleased with where we are.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Tim. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nRod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to dig into this order growth a little bit. Obviously, very strong numbers there, but somewhat inconsistent with the way that we would have expected them to come out. I just wanted to—and the thing that's inconsistent is you guys are saying up over 15% in the quarter, but then down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We would have calculated closer to flat, like minus 1%. We're just curious whether there was any restatement of the July quarter last year. You guys had called out 31% order growth there. Anything else going on with the dynamics of these orders that might help us to understand that discrepancy, at least in our numbers? I've got a follow-up.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Rod, I saw some folks who thought we would be down 15%. I think it's just different ways of modeling. When we were thinking about this question, and we obviously know that 31%, and then in Q1, we're comparing against 33%, we were trying to find other ways to look at the business to indicate the reality of the demand signal. Let me just give you a few of those characteristics. First of all, from a product order perspective, as I said, it was the second highest in history, which would be only eclipsed by Q4 a year ago. It grew 15%. On a sequential basis, that's actually in range with our historicals. If you go back, if you take out last year, which was an abnormal sequential, then it's very much in line.\nIt's in the range of what we've seen for the last 10 years. The 15%, you had enterprise, public sector, and commercial all growing in solid double digits on a sequential basis. Again, growing sequentially off our largest third-quarter product bookings ever. We also have continued growth in the pipeline. As we exited Q4, we saw very good growth in pipeline, which is a good indicator of going forward. The final thing I would tell you is that if you—the way our sales teams forecasted the quarter, at the beginning of month three, they revised their forecast for the quarter, and they finished stronger than they thought they would. We had strength as we exited the quarter, so linearity was solid. We just haven't seen anything that would indicate a significant shift in the demand signal from our customers.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, Rod, there was no—to be clear on your question, there was no change in the way we report year-on-year. It's exactly the same. The only other thing that I would add to the comments that Chuck just made, linearity in the quarter was quite strong. In fact, the last week of the quarter was actually the same size as it had been in the prior year. The month-to-month linearity was exactly in line with last year and with prior year's expectations. We saw strength right through the end of Q4.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGotcha. Okay. Just as a follow-up, could I ask you guys on inventory? I know inventory's moved up quite a bit again. Do you think inventory starts to come down next quarter? Just curious kind of where we are in that ebb and flow of inventory given the supply shortages and so on. Yeah.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nWhat's sitting in inventory, Rod, is the rest of the parts that aren't under constraint. As the ones that are constrained free up, we can square the sets and get the product shipped out the door to our customers. It is growing. It's up about $1 billion year-on-year, sitting at $2.5 billion. Our advance payments are up as well. Both of those are a bit of a headwind to cash flows, as you saw. Yeah, it's much more a statement of making sure we've got everything we need so that as those constrained parts clear up, which we saw a little bit of that toward the end of Q4, we can square the sets and get it out the door and in the hands of our customers.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nAll right, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore, you may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nSame thoughts with you, my question. I have two as well. The first one I have is just on gross margins, or maybe when I think about the EPS guide of 4%-6% for fiscal 2023. How do you think about gross margins in that backdrop? Are buybacks embedded in that guide as well?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. There's no added buyback in there. We've talked about our cap allocation policy. Our share buybacks have both a systemic component to it that's just offsetting the shares that we issue through our equity plans, and an opportunistic component. On the what's our expectation on gross margin through the year? Of course, we don't guide that for the full year, Amit. What I'd say is my expectation is, as we go through the year and we can work through the backlog, we'll begin to ship out of that backlog more and more orders that actually reflect the price increases that we put in place last year. As we do, that'll be a tailwind to margins throughout the year. I would see margins going up as much as 50 basis points between our first quarter guide and where we end the year.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nIf I can just follow up, there's been a fair amount of fear that higher interest rates will start to impact enterprise spending across the board. Your print, your guide doesn't seem to suggest you see any signs of that. Yeah, I'd love to get your perspective. What are you hearing from your customers as the macro environment is changing? Really related to that, are you seeing any shift in how they procure or what they want to buy from you as the macro environment changes?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah, it's a good question. What I would say is that we are not immune to any significant change in the macro that would result in enterprise spending shifting. My comments are just that we haven't seen a material demand signal change as we've entered into Q1. That's where we are. I think on last call, I believe I talked a lot about how I believe that post-pandemic, the view of technology by our customers is much different than it would have been seven, eight, nine years ago. I think if you ask our customers if they would pause spending during a crisis, they would probably respond, when is there not going to be a crisis given what we've dealt with the last three years? In general, we don't hear a lot of difference.\nRelative to your question around, have we seen any different buying behavior or what are they trying to buy from us? In some cases, customers are looking for a little shorter ROI, so that affects how they think about what products they're buying in these kinds of times. In some cases, customers are looking ahead to lead times to fiscal 2023 budgets and trying to better understand what their budgets are going to look like because the shipments and the payments would be in the 2023 timeframe. Other than that, we're not seeing anything significantly different.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director of IT Hardware and Communications Equipment Sector, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Congrats on the nice sprint.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Ahmed.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Ahmed. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research. You may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nCybersecurity and Network and Equipment Analyst, Morgan Stanley Investment Research\n\nGreat. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. Maybe just on kind of increasing supply availability. I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that do you feel like is just some of these lagging edge components are starting to become more available, and how much of that is a result of kind of redesigns that you've done over the course of the year that have just kind of given you more optionality. Maybe just a second question for you, Chuck. Just as we've seen kind of evaluation correction on a lot of kind of the software space, how does that change your view of strategic activity? Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Meta. On the first one, I'd say that it's a combination of both of those. As we said earlier, we saw increased volumes in the broker network during the quarter, which candidly was an opportunity we took advantage of, which is why you saw the higher top line. We were able to get more product shipped to our customers, which we obviously were very happy about. We had to pay more for those components, and we think that'll continue probably over the next 60 to 90 days. We think some of those purchases will begin to become available from the same suppliers that have put the excess inventory into the marketplace. At the same time, I think I said this on our last call, we've had hundreds of product redesigns going on.\nTwo of our high-volume products that also have good margins will begin to ship in the redesign space sort of towards the latter end of Q1 and then into the balance of the year, which we think will be helpful as well. It's a combination of both of those things. That's what gives us a little bit of optimism that things will continue to improve during the year. On the second question, Meta, on the valuations, I've had this one a few times. I've been asked if our M&A strategy has changed because of the valuations. I've said that our strategy hasn't changed, but the openness to talk to us from some of the companies that thought they had different strategic exits might have changed. We haven't changed our strategy.\nWe just think that it potentially creates more opportunity for us with companies that might not have been willing because they thought there was a high-flying IPO ahead of them that they may not believe is the case right now. The market is obviously taking a much different view on profitability versus just growth.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nCybersecurity and Network and Equipment Analyst, Morgan Stanley Investment Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani with Bank of America Securities. You may go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nHi, guys. I'm trying to distinguish between the growth next year, which is probably a function of better supplies and backlog, very high backlog, and between the spending environment. You started touching on it when we asked about the enterprise. Let me maybe expand the question about the environment. When you go through your various, what you call, used to be called theaters, and you go through cloud and service providers, and enterprise, etc., can you take us through your expectations for the spending environments, and maybe how long it takes to close deals versus before when you look into the next few quarters? I'm trying to understand if the environment, as you see today, whether it deteriorates or not at all, or which are the areas where we see slowdown or not. I have a second question, just if you can touch on security. Security was good again. It was good, actually, much better. There is improvement throughout the quarters if you can touch on your position in security.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tal. I think Scott has touched on it, that the revenue for fiscal year 2023 is much more a byproduct of component availability than it necessarily is connected to demand. I will tell you that our current models would have us exiting fiscal 2023 with roughly the same backlog as we're entering FY 2023. As you look at the different segments that you've described, we had small business growth in Q4 of, I think it was double digits on a global basis, which is a good sign that that's continuing to grow. When we dissect it, commercial grew 39% a year ago. Sequentially in double digits, enterprise was up in the mid-20s last year. Sequentially growing in high double digits, those are good signs for us.\nThe pipeline growth that we've seen as we exited the quarter just says that there's still a lot out there. Right now, we're modeling for just things to continue as we see them and taking into consideration. As you asked me to go around the regions, I think Asia and Europe, we had conversations with our team this week, and they seem to continue to be reasonably optimistic as we are in the Americas. It was a pretty consistent story. Scott?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Yeah. Tal, the only thing I'd add is, as you look at that 4%-6% growth that we've forecasted now for fiscal 2023, it is absolutely supply constrained. While the supply situation we saw late in our fourth quarter that we just closed, there was some easing, easing doesn't mean it's over.\nWe are going to have supply constraints throughout fiscal 2023 in just a few areas. Were it not for those, we would be growing much more quickly. It's not a case of demand. We're not demand constrained. We are supply constrained in fiscal 2023.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nWhen it comes to your answer about service providers and cloud, same as the answer for the enterprise, meaning you do not expect much of a change as of now in the environment?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nNo, we don't see anything. What I would tell you about the service provider business is that because of the long lead times, we started a process of doing long-term planning with them that I've talked about before. We actually have deferred bookings that don't show up anywhere right now, approaching half a billion dollars because they're outside of our standard shipment window when they would like to get those. We've got orders out quarters from now from them that are all non-cancelable because of the contracts that we've done. We feel good about that momentum. We think that those customers will continue to spend into all of the trends that we've talked about. Given that we just shipped our first 800 GB system to one of the web scale players, we can continue to see them take advantage of these higher-speed platforms.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nNow, Tal, you also asked about security.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes, I did.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nWe saw, I think Scott mentioned this in his, we had some really good growth and some backlog movement, to be honest, on the firewall side. We had a really solid quarter on shipments from a firewall perspective. We also had strength in our endpoint business, strength in our zero trust business, and we're continuing to—that is the number one investment area for the company this year. We're continuing to drive, I think, greater innovation there and evolve that portfolio as we've described strategically. I think we'll just continue to see improvement. This quarter did get a boost from us clearing some backlog in the firewall space.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Tal. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the good execution this quarter. I guess I wanted to dive into the order numbers a bit here. Historically, you've talked about sort of SMB or commercial being a bit more of a leading indicator into enterprise trends. When you look at the order trends right now, it does seem like you're seeing sort of a bit more of a sort of volatility around the enterprise orders relative to the commercial segment. I wanted to see if there's anything that you can help us in terms of thinking about sort of the trends we're seeing there. Just the second one there is sort of collaboration, and seems like a very tough backdrop to turn around collaboration results in. How should we think about sustainability of the growth here for collaboration?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Samik, thank you. I'll comment on this. The small business was, again, strong as I spoke about just a moment ago. I think it's really important when you have these abnormal year-over-year comparisons for us to find other ways to assess the strength, which is why we looked at the sequential growth. Sequentially, they're both up in double digits, both commercial and enterprise, which is against a very large quarter a quarter ago. We're comfortable right now that they're moving as they should be. Candidly, for commercial to grow at all after the extreme growth that we had a year ago was actually quite positive. I actually view that favorably, given the strength that they showed a year ago. It was probably the highest growth rate we've had forever in that space, or at least in the last 10 years.\nOverall, I think we don't see any sort of significant demand shift, as I said earlier. On the collab front, it's a little bit like the security message that I gave a few minutes ago. We did clear a lot of device business in the backlog. The growth, as Scott said in his opening comments, was driven largely by the device business and offset by some declines we had in meetings and calling. I will say that the teams are working really hard on the meetings and calling side. Those have been strong. The calling side has been strong for us in the past few quarters. The product portfolio is in really good shape. The net promoter score for our meetings platform is now 64, and that was a million customer responses. It's a hugely improved experience.\nThis year, the teams are really focused on trying to get that back to growth. We've got a lot of work to do.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nIttai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. A couple for me. Maybe first on the supply chain. I just want to make sure I understand your expectations for component availability. Maybe you could talk about price changes of components. It doesn't sound like you're assuming any changes in pricing. Is that correct? If there will be a change in pricing, what are the odds that you actually take down the prices of your products?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I'll start, Chuck, and if you want to jump in, let's do that. From a component availability standpoint, Itay, that's been the most fluid area of our forecast over the last several quarters. As we look ahead, we did see signs of stability during Q4. As I said, late in Q4 that we just closed, we actually saw some improvement. The way that improvement showed up was availability of some of the constrained parts that we have been chasing in the broker network. Obviously, when you buy from the broker network, you pay a premium for those, and you see that reflected in the gross margins. I think there'll still be some of that in Q1. You see that reflected in our gross margin guide in Q1, and then it gets better as the year goes on.\nI'm not assuming any price declines or any cost declines coming from our suppliers. I don't see them lining up to come back and say, hey, good news, Chuck, we're going to charge you less for the component parts. There may be some benefit in freight and logistics. We'll see as commercial airlift comes back online. I think the benefits we'll get will be much more from shipping more out of our backlog than our orders that were received after we did the price increases last year.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAs I think about your fiscal year, fiscal 2023 guidance, what is the underlying assumption regarding volume component availability exiting fiscal 2023? How much better are you expecting it to be in your guidance? What's embedded there?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Again, our guidance assumes that we continue to be supply constrained through the year. As I said, if we could get more supply, we would be growing more quickly in fiscal 2023. We'll continue to be supply constrained. Our modeling shows that our backlog as we exit fiscal 2023, Chuck touched on this earlier, that we think the dollar value, obviously, it's not the same orders, but the dollar value is roughly unchanged from the dollar value we roll into fiscal 2023 with. I think we'll continue to face component availability headwinds throughout the year.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nWould you expect your order growth in fiscal 2023 to exceed your 4%-6% top-line guidance?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. We don't forecast order growth, as you know, Ittai. That's not one that I want to jump into at this point. I think that probably the key takeaway would be we're not demand constrained, we're supply constrained as you look at fiscal 2023.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Ittai.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Ittai.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nPaul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nThank you. I know my questions have been touched on in previous comments and responses, Chuck, but I want to ask you anyway. They're big picture questions, one on revenue, one on margins. The first one, from your comments and the comments of your peers about networking, it looks like networking demand is in the best shape it's been in since the bubble in the late '90s. That, of course, was a bubble. The supply constraints, it's making it hard to discern what's going on from a competitive landscape standpoint. I'm sure you guys are aware. I know it's come up on previous calls, but there's this sense I think created by your competitors, rightly or wrongly, but I want to let you respond that in campus enterprise in particular, which is still core to what you all do, that you've got competitive pressures.\nAny thoughts you can share on what you're seeing in your campus enterprise business, both on the wireline switching and on the wireless LAN side? You're clearly talking about strength from an order perspective, but I want to let you respond. I have a question on margins.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems",
    "content2": "Okay. First of all, I think market share is a very difficult thing to assess right now, to your point, because of everything sitting in the backlog. I do believe that Q4 was the second largest Catalyst 9000 shipment quarter in the history of the product. That would indicate that it's strong. I think as we continue to work through our backlog, you'll see some share come out.\nI would encourage you to look at market share over a trending quarter timeframe as opposed to a point in time because you just never know. We've got some products that we've been redesigning that we have backlog that will begin to ship en masse that will actually flip market share numbers pretty significantly. My competitor is going to be telling you exactly what I'm telling you right now. It's something you just got to watch over time. I'm not, I mean, clearly, we have competition in the campus. We have very strong competition. We always have. Given the volume of the products that we're shipping right now, I don't feel like we're losing significant share.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nOkay. Also, from a big picture perspective, once upon a time, networking in general and Cisco in particular was the canary in the coal mine. When there was a macro downturn, you guys were the first to see it. Networking was the easiest thing to push off. Everyone let their networks run hotter with their enterprise carriers, etc. That seems to be flipped, where networking is actually not seeing weakness that other technology product markets are seeing. I just want to make sure that I've got that construct right. The real question, though, on the margin side, you all were at record or near-record gross and operating margin levels going into the pandemic before input costs, ICs, SIMIs, freight logistics, etc., spiked. Any thoughts on where you can get, where the long-term model can get back to once supply chain normalizes?\nI assume that freight and logistics mix and pricing will go back to pre-pandemic levels. It will help you and others out. I also assume that the increase in SIMI, IC, and input costs are not going back to where they were. You'll be able to offset some, but probably not all of that with your price increases. Let me let you respond.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. Let me take the networking resilience, the resilience of the networking market first. Scott, you can take the margin question. Paul, I think you're right. I've said this repeatedly. I think what's driven this is there are two things. Number one, the pandemic revealed the impact of not keeping your core infrastructure technology up to speed. Customers struggled. I think it made them realize that they had a lot of tech debt that needed to be dealt with. They don't want to get in that position again. That's the first thing. The second thing is all of these mega trends that I mentioned in my opening comments, I mean, these customers are re-architecting their entire infrastructure for the first time in years to deal with hybrid cloud and to deal with all of the mobile workers. We see IoT exploding.\nYou see all of the climate activity is going to be a tailwind to our business because you have to connect all these industrial systems to be able to control them. You've got to shift to 400 GB. I mean, I'll give you a data point. 400 GB ports, we're up almost 700% year over year for us. We've got over 1,000 customers now that have bought 400 GB, and we shipped our first 800 GB. All these trends continue. You've got 5G. You've got Wi-Fi 6. You've got this application observability, the re-architecture of application. I think it's a combination of the realization the pandemic brought on around technology debt and never letting them get to that point. These mega trends that are going on. Scott, you want to take the gross margin question?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nI think, Paul, on the gross margin question, I think you nailed the trends. I do not expect input costs, particularly around semis, to come down. I look forward to the day that I come to the office and there is a message from our semiconductor supplier saying, hey, good news, your price is going down. I just do not see that happening. Price will offset part of it. I think you got that part right too. I think the only thing I would add that probably is in your thinking, but you did not say it, so I will. Over the longer term, as we mix more software in, that will be a tailwind at the gross margin line. Just add that to your thinking, and I think you have got it nailed.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nScott, can you get back to that record level?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nI don't want to get into forecasting the longer term at that level of granularity right now, Paul.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nManaging Director, Cowen\n\nI appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Paul. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nBen Bolin with Cleveland Research. You may go ahead.\n\nBen Bollin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Cleveland Research\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first one, you talked about backlog expected to sustain at current levels exiting fiscal 2023. I think you said software backlog was north of $2 billion again in the quarter. What was the product backlog? Where did that finish the quarter?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. We didn't give that stat, and that's not one that I want to start giving every quarter. Ben, what we did say qualitatively is it grew again. What I'll tell you is it was actually up triple digits again on a year-on-year basis. The overall backlog, software backlog, is a pretty significant headwind to our software growth. It's well north of the $2 billion that we talked about.\n\nBen Bollin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Cleveland Research\n\nOkay. One other item. I'm not asking for a forecast on RPO. I guess that's a precursor to sort of asking for one. When you think about RPO in the concept of the broader 4%-6% rev guide for the year, is the assumption as you shift more to software that RPO should consistently outperform your top-line growth? How do you think about the relationship of those two metrics longer term?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. There's a couple of dynamics going on in RPO. I'd say in general, you're right. Obviously, duration has an effect on RPO as well, but it varies a bit by product line. For the quarter, we just announced the 6% product RPO growth. We had double-digit product RPO growth in secure agile networks, in optimized app experiences, and in security. I almost forgot. We had high single-digit growth in Internet for the Future. I'd say that the headwind there, of course, is collab from an RPO standpoint. Longer term, I think you'd expect those dynamics to continue. As we turn around the go-to-market and the sales side of collab, that will flip from being a headwind to more of a tailwind on product RPO growth.\n\nBen Bollin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Cleveland Research\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nOkay. We have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nSimon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. I've got one sort of short-term and one longer-term. On the short-term side, we heard some anecdotes that some multi-product projects have been split up because of the supply chain constraints. I want to get a sense of whether or not that's something that's happening as a way for you to work around some of the bottlenecks, to get some projects out the door that might not have, and how that might factor into the numbers. In terms of the longe- term, Todd Nightingale had made a comment in a meeting about Cisco no longer managing to the org chart. I wanted to see if maybe, Chuck, you could elaborate on what the implications are by that particular statement. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nWell, Simon, if I could ask you to clarify for me on this short-term question, I didn't quite understand. You're saying that we are breaking up orders, or we're asking customers to, or customers are making that decision? What exactly was the question?\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nYeah. I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's customers asking to break apart some larger projects where they're buying a multitude of components from Cisco and essentially saying, let's not wait for the components you can't get. Ship me what you can. I'll get the other stuff elsewhere. I've heard these as anecdotes, and I'm trying to understand how substantive it is.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nYeah. I have not heard any discussion on that particular topic, but it would not surprise me. I mean, if I was a customer and if I had a project that I could actually drive some constructive ROI by doing part of it, then I would split it up to try to get the part that I could get for sure. I tell you what we are seeing. We have customers that are being really good with us about telling us what they desperately need and what they are okay waiting for. They have been really great about saying, look, I am not going to come tell you the sky is falling and tell you I need everything in backlog tomorrow. Here is what I really need. Here is what I need this time.\nHere's what I need this time. We've been working through that a lot with customers, and that may be a variation of what you've heard. That's the only thing that I can think of. On the Todd comment on the org chart, I think the comment is we don't want to ship our org chart. We talked at Cisco Live about a huge number of cross-business unit technology combinations that we were delivering. I'll give you a couple of examples, but this is what he's talking about. Our Secure Connect Plus that we started shipping includes SD-WAN technology from the enterprise networking team, and cloud security from the security team brought together in a managed as-a-service offer for customers. There's integration going on between AppDynamics and ThousandEyes that actually will be bidirectional intelligence that will flow between those two.\nYou've got AppDynamics doing the same thing with Talos and other aspects of the security portfolio for that exact reason. Before Jonathan took on all of the portfolio that Todd had and his own, there was a lot of work Todd was doing with Jonathan's team around private 5G and how do we build private 5G services through a combination of those. That's what Todd's talking about. I think the teams have done a good job of really leading with what the customer needs and not building from the way the org chart's built. That's what he's talking about.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thanks for that clarification.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nThat's it.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Simon.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco Systems\n\nGood. All right. Well, thank you all. Before we wrap, I want to make a few closing comments. I just first want to say I'm really proud of what our teams have achieved. It's obviously a very dynamic environment, and the teams have really shown great execution and great focus. We did have tough compares, so we worked really hard to try to give you a different way of looking at the demand. We'll let you know if we see anything change when we come back together in the next call. Right now, demand remains solid. I think customers really do understand the value the technology brings to their strategy. I also appreciate what our supply chain teams have achieved, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing and how that supply hopefully will continue to ease throughout the year.\nThe business model transition is really helping us give you more visibility and predictability. I'm also proud of how our team has rallied around our purpose. Just a couple of comments. This year, we set another record, a record-high number of employees who were given back into their communities. Our net zero by 2024 target and near-term targets were just approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative under its net zero standard. We're not only committed to our own goals, but also building technology that helps our customers meet their own goals. Lastly, we've been named the number one Great Place to Work in 20 countries around the world. On any day, I would be proud of that. This is super important right now given the competition for talent around the world.\nIt really does make a difference when we're trying to hire new talent into the organization. It really makes us more resilient than ever. I think we're well-positioned for long-term growth. I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco Systems\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll go ahead and close out the call. Cisco's next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, 16 November 2022 at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time.

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco Systems' third quarter fiscal 2022 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. Please note, included in the materials that accompany this call is a slide which summarizes the impacts from the war in Ukraine and the extra week in Q3, fiscal 2021. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022.\nThey are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. When we spoke with you back in February, we entered Q3 in the second half of our fiscal year with optimism, despite the supply and component challenges, and other headwinds impacting us and many of our peers.\nMany of those factors that fuel that optimism remain unchanged today. We continue to see strong demand, resulting in record backlog. Our business transformation is progressing well, and our differentiated innovation across our portfolio is helping our customers embrace and adopt the multiple technology transitions happening. However, there were two unanticipated events since our last earnings call which impacted our Q3 revenue performance. The first is the war in Ukraine. This resulted in us ceasing operations in Russia and Belarus, and had a corresponding revenue impact, which Scott will discuss. The second relates to COVID-related lockdowns in China, which began in late March. These lockdowns resulted in an even more severe shortage of certain critical components. This, in turn, prevented us from shipping products to customers at the levels we originally anticipated heading into Q3.\nOur Q4 guidance incorporates a wider-than-usual range, taking into account the revenue impact of the war in Ukraine and the continuing uncertainty related to the China-COVID lockdowns. Given this uncertainty, we are being practical about the current environment and erring on the side of caution in terms of our outlook, taking it one quarter at a time. We believe that our revenue performance in the upcoming quarters is less dependent on demand and more dependent on the supply availability in this increasingly complex environment. While certain aspects of the current situation are largely out of our control, our teams have been working on several mitigation actions to help alleviate many of the component issues that we've been facing. We believe that we will begin to see the benefits of these actions in the first half of next fiscal year. Now, let me talk more specifically about our third quarter performance.\nAs I just mentioned, many of the positives we've discussed over the past few quarters remain, resulting in continued solid demand for our solutions. Total product orders grew 8% year-over-year, leading to yet another record backlog of well over $15 billion, up 10% sequentially, and up 130% year-over-year. This momentum reaffirms the critical role we play in our customers' futures. Our business transformation also progressed nicely. In Q3, we saw ARR growth of 11%, ending the quarter at over $22 billion, and product ARR growth of 18%. We also exited the quarter with over $30 billion in remaining performance obligations, or RPO. We also delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our guidance range.\nThis was driven by effective pricing actions and spending discipline, all of which allowed us to offset lower volumes and deliver both gross and operating margins above the high end of our guidance range, and deliver on our bottom-line profitability target for the quarter. I want to reiterate what I said earlier. The fundamental drivers across our business are strong. While we are facing some short-term challenges, it does not change our long-term outlook, our alignment to our customers' most critical challenges, or our belief in the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Last week, we hosted our global customer advisory board meeting where we met with close to 100 customers, and they consistently shared that technology is at the heart of their strategy, and has become even more important to everything they do. It's driving not just their strategies, but also their overall business transformation.\nThe technology they are adopting from Cisco is driving their business agility, allowing them to move with greater speed, and empowering them to deliver differentiated experiences for their customers. Now, I'd like to touch on some highlights from the quarter. We continue to see strong demand in several areas of our business. Our web scale business remains strong as we continue to help these customers build their capabilities to connect and serve their customers and end users at scale, from the data center to the edge. This is leading to continued strength in orders, which grew over 50%, and on a trailing four-quarter basis, we had over 100% growth. This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of solid demand as we are winning new franchises, expanding our design wins, and taking share in web scale.\nI remain incredibly proud of the progress we've made and the momentum we have in this space. We are also extremely pleased with the traction of our 400 gig solutions, including the Cisco 8000, which is the fastest-growing SP routing platform in Cisco's history. In addition, our Silicon One portfolio, ZR and ZR Plus optics, and our Acacia portfolio of optical networking products also continue to perform well. From a product revenue perspective, our performance was led by solid demand across a majority of our portfolio, including switching, SP routing, wireless, security, and SD-WAN. Our performance in these areas reflects the ongoing investments that our customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations to deliver differentiated experiences. Looking forward, the shift to hybrid cloud, 5G, 400 gig, IoT, hybrid work, and the explosion of applications are driving the increased need for next-generation networking, connectivity, security, and observability solutions.\nCisco is well-positioned to deliver for our customers with our end-to-end platforms and solutions. I'm also very proud of our pace of innovation. During the quarter, Cisco announced new innovations across our networking and cloud portfolios, along with technologies to enhance experiences in hybrid work environments. We also introduced our new predictive networks to help organizations learn, predict, and avoid network disruptions. We have even more innovation, which we'll announce at RSA and our own Cisco Live event in June. In addition to our deep passion for innovation, all of us at Cisco believe we have a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place through both the technology we build and the purpose we rally around, to power an inclusive future for all.\nI believe this intersection of technology and purpose is why we were named the number one best company to work for in the US by Fortune and Great Place to Work for the second year in a row. In summary, while the quarter clearly did not play out as expected, demand remained solid, and the fundamentals of our business are strong. We remain focused on executing against the strategy we laid out at our investor day. We will also continue to be resolute in our focus to transform our business for more predictability and agility, while bringing to market a robust pipeline of innovation. We remain confident in our long-term growth and the opportunities that we have in front of us. I want to thank our teams around the world for all that they do, executing with dedication, focus, and excellence in an incredibly dynamic environment.\nThey continue to focus on our customers with unparalleled innovation, resiliency, and determination. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. We saw solid growth in product orders, net income, and earnings per share, despite the challenges Chuck just outlined. Product order growth was driven by strength across most of our portfolio, while disciplined spend and supply chain management drove our profitability. Total revenue was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 34.7%, up 110 basis points, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.87, up 5%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. In March, we stopped business operations in both Russia and Belarus, which had a negative impact to revenue of approximately $200 million, or 2 percentage points of growth.\nHistorically, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine collectively have represented approximately 1% of our total revenue. The impact this quarter was a bit higher than our historical run rate due to additional charges to revenue we recorded for uncollectible receivables and other items. As a reminder, Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit to total revenue in Q3 of 2021 of approximately 3 full percentage points of growth. On a combined basis, the impact of the year-over-year total revenue growth rate for the extra week and the war in Ukraine was approximately 5 percentage points. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 3%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8%, driven by the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine, which combined impacted our growth by approximately 8 percentage points.\nWithin product revenue, Secure Agile Networks was solid, with revenues up 4%. Switching grew, driven by strength in data center switching with our Nexus 9000 products. Campus switching growth was led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had a double-digit increase, driven by broad-based strength across our portfolio, including our Wi-Fi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. We also had solid growth in servers. Enterprise routing declined, primarily driven by edge and access, and slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN. Internet for the Future was up 6%, driven by strength in Acacia, Optical, Optics, and Core Networking products, including double-digit growth in the Cisco 8000. Collaboration was down 7%, driven by declines in our meetings, calling, and contact center offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform as a service. End-to-end security grew 7%, with broad strength across most of the portfolio.\nOur Zero Trust portfolio performed well, with double-digit growth, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences was up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in both of our SaaS-based offerings, ThousandEyes, and Intersight. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more subscriptions and software. Total software revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3%, with the product portion down 1%. Total software revenue growth would have been 5 points higher, excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine. 83% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 1 percentage point year-on-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of 4%. Total subscription revenue would have been 7 points higher, excluding the combined negative impact of the extra week in the prior year and the war in Ukraine.\nTotal subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $22.4 billion, an increase of 11%, with strong product ARR growth of 18%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.2 billion, up 7%. Product RPO increased 13%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short-term RPO grew 9% to $16.2 billion. We had solid product order growth in Q3 of 8%, with strength across most of the business. Looking at our geographic segments, the Americas was up 9%, EMEA up 4%, and APJC up 11%. In our customer markets, commercial was up 19%, service provider was up 8%, public sector was up 4%, and enterprise was flat. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in above the high end of our guidance range at 65.3%, down 70 basis points year-over-year.\nProduct gross margin was 64.1%, down 80 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.9%, up 20 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints, as well as higher freight and logistics costs, partially offset by strong positive pricing impact. We continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers. To give a sense of scale of the shortages, we currently see constraints in Q4 on roughly 350 critical components out of a total of 41,000 unique component part numbers. Our supply chain team is aggressively pursuing multiple options to close those shortages. Given our solid product orders, we once again saw a significant increase in our backlog levels for both hardware and software, well beyond our normal historical levels.\nAs Chuck said, our ending product backlog grew to well over $15 billion, and software backlog grew to more than $2 billion, both up 10% sequentially. Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.2 billion in remaining performance obligations. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $20.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by advance payments to secure future supply. These advance payments had a negative 9% year-on-year impact on Q3 operating cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders during the quarter, now comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend, and approximately $250 million of share repurchases.\nYear to date, we have returned a total of approximately $10 billion in value to our shareholders via cash dividends and stock repurchases, and have more than $17 billion available under our board stock repurchase authorization. To summarize, we're navigating the highly complex environment while continuing to make progress on our business model shift, and making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q4. In terms of supply, we expect the challenges we experienced in Q3 to continue into Q4. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of -1% to -5.5%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 33.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.84. For the full year of fiscal 2022, guidance is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.29 to $3.37, up 2% to 5% year-on-year. In both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley Investment Research, you may go ahead. Great. Thanks.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director and VP, Morgan Stanley\n\nMaybe, Chuck, if you could just kind of give a sense in what you were seeing in macro from your customers. I know that the enterprise orders were flat year-over-year. Just are you seeing any change in their behavior, either just given what's happening in overall macro conditions or just currency and inflation? Would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Amanda, thank you. On the demand issue, I'd point out a few things. Number one, without the 2 percentage points of orders that we debooked relative to Russia and Belarus, we grew 10% against a year-ago growth of 10%. We feel good about that. Our customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. We're not hearing that from them.\nAgain, we had our global customer advisory board just a couple of weeks ago where we had 100 of our biggest customers, and they were all talking about projects and the strategic nature of everything they're trying to accomplish. The last thing I would point out is on the enterprise side, last quarter we grew 37%. Just to keep in mind, the way we define enterprise is a finite list of named customers, so it tends to be more lumpy. If I look at how the industry defines enterprise, that would reflect a combination of our enterprise and our commercial business. For comparisons to what we're hearing in the marketplace, I thought we would give you that combined number. If you combine enterprise and commercial together, we grew 9%, but without the Russia impact, we actually grew 12%. On a trailing 12-month basis, it grew 28%.\nWe're still comfortable with the demand signals that we're seeing, and our customers aren't telling us anything differently right now.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director and VP, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Sam Chatterjee from JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Chuck, on the demand question again, just your guiding to the fiscal fourth quarter to be now almost sort of similar to what the third quarter is or even down a bit, which is, if I go back, historically has never really—I don't see many instances of that. I mean, is that really a reflection of the supply environment, or are there any other sort of aspects of demand stemming from the geopolitical sort of situation here that's impacting that? When do we sort of start to see you sort of cycle past some of that? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Samik, it's a great question. Let me start with just the basic answer: there is no reflection of demand issue in our Q4 guide. That has nothing to do with the Q4 guide. Let me try to describe how we got to that. I think it's important for everybody to understand. When we look at our Q3 results, from a revenue perspective, we had a $200 million impact from us ceasing operations in Russia and corresponding revenue write-downs that occurred. Those were one time. We then had, if you recall, our quarter ends at the end of April. Most of what you've heard from others, their quarters ended the end of March. We experienced an entire quarter of the China lockdowns. In Shanghai, it was from 27 March until today. Shenzhen shut down, but it opened up a week later.\nWe're talking really about the Shanghai situation. We had $200 million from Russia, and then we had $300 million that was completely attributed to our inability to get power supplies out of China. That's the simplicity of what caused the problem. As an example, we had 11,000 PCB assemblies built we couldn't get power supplies for because of the lockdown. That's the simple fact of what happened in Q3. When we look at Q4 and you think about the Shanghai lockdown and what we've heard, because in Shanghai, there are lots of components that go into our power supply, we're not able to get those components. Shanghai now is saying they're going to open up 1 June. We don't know exactly what that means and what that means to when that implies that we would start getting any supply out.\nCorrespondingly, we believe when they open up and when they do allow transportation logistics to start up, we believe there's going to be a high degree of congestion. We believe that there's going to be lots of competition for ports capacity, airport capacity, and we just believe that that, combined with the inbound efforts trying to get raw materials back into the country, etc., we just believe that it's going to be impossible for us to catch up on this issue in Q4, which is what led to the guidance in Q4. Even though these top-line numbers don't look good, it's a very simple explanation as to what occurred. The follow-on part of your question is, when do we think this gets better?\nWell, if we make the assumption that China does begin to open up and we do begin to get more natural flow of the power supplies, we also have had our teams over the last six to nine months have been working on a lot of mitigating actions, redesigning over 100 products to give us component diversity. We believe that a combination of those starting in our Q1 and in the first half of our year will start to see the benefit of that. That's when we expect to see it improve to some extent. We need to get through the next 90 days, but I'm just being as transparent as I can about what we see and when we think some of that improvement will occur.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Sam. Next question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.\nYou may go ahead, sir.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Hey, guys. I want to dig into that a little bit, a check on the supply chain. You seem to be much more impacted than some of your peers in the industry. I'm just trying to gauge whether you have an unusually high exposure to China that others do not. Is there any color you can give us on what percentage of your components come from China, and why is it that you stand out relative to a couple others? I understand that you had an April quarter and some of them had March, but they did report mid-late April, and none of them have signaled anything. Clearly they've seen what's happening in April, and they haven't said anything.\nThere's a second part to this, just thinking kind of longer term, just given the challenges geopolitically, Ukraine, Russia, and the risks that are associated with China on a geopolitical standpoint, but also clearly in their COVID policy. Is there any some sort of a long-term planning that disconnects you from China as a source for components longer term?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Ittai, thank you. Both good questions. I think on the first one, I think that the biggest differentiation was April. I have spoken to peers who are feeling the same thing we are, but we're reporting the full month of impact, and it was an April issue for us.\nNow, on a normalized basis for that question across the portfolio, all of us design products with different components in, so there's opportunity for us to have a unique issue with one component that we may have designed into a product, or we may have a unique advantage because we designed a certain component into a product. Those are the areas where I talked about we're redesigning where we have unique problems or just problems in general. Others may have the same problems. We think that the exposure in general was because of the month of April. Also, we do massive volumes. In general, you would think that's a huge advantage, but just to put it in perspective, we shipped more revenue in the last week of our quarter than many of our competitors that you're referencing shipped in their entire quarter.\nIt's just an issue that it shows up in a bigger number for us than it would. If they have the same problem, it might be a $20 million impact. For us, it might be a $200 million, $400 million impact. That's the first one. The second one, what I would say is that we are constantly evaluating our global supply chain. It's not about one country, it's about resilience. The way we've designed supply chains over the last 15, 20 years as an industry, I think we all realize we're evolving that now at the same time that we're triaging all of the current issues that we have. Our teams have a dual challenge. We are constantly driving geographic resilience. The example I would give is that before COVID, we had regional redundancy built in.\nWe did not have a plan for a country to shut down. It takes time to go out and create that geographic resilience, but our teams are working on all of those kinds of things right now. They will continue to do that, Itai.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nAll right. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Itai. Next question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. Hopefully, I'll make sense here, but I want to give this a shot. Your gross margin looked relatively resilient in the quarter and the outlook, and your revenue was light. We've seen the opposite from some of your peers. I'm wondering if part of the issue is the usage of brokers and paying very high fees for parts in the, secondary or tertiary markets.\nIs that something you didn't do and that prevented you from reaching revenue but allowed you to have a better gross margin? I'm just trying to understand some of your practices relative to your peers that allowed you to have a good gross margin but the lighter sales. Does that all make sense?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nIt absolutely does, Simon. Let me start, then I'm going to kick it to Scott to talk a little bit about it. First and foremost, we are incredibly active purchasers in the broker market. You can imagine with our buying power, they call us first. No, that has nothing to do with it. In fact, we've spent a lot of time with our supply chain team, who were giving us examples of where they've bought product in the broker market recently.\nI don't think that's it, but Scott can explain what did happen there.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. It's a great question, Simon. What I'd add is, if you recall, we did two price increases this year. The first one rolled in right about the end of the calendar year, and the second one at the beginning of our second quarter. We said at the time that we thought you continued to ask like, hey, when are those price increases, when are they going to show up in the top line. We said we thought we would begin to see the benefit of those toward the end of the third quarter, which is the quarter we just closed. That's exactly what happened.\nWhile the unit shipments in the quarter were off because of the issues that we've talked about with the supply chain with component supply, we were able to offset that with pretty strong pricing. In fact, and we published this in our Q, so you'll see it there, our pricing was up about 160 basis points in Q3. While we did have a unit impact from the component supply, it was offset by some of the things that we're doing, and that we're beginning to realize on the price front. We are actively pursuing every avenue. It's got to be a qualified vendor, and we're working to qualify different sources at the same time. We are actively pursuing that, whether it's through a broker, obviously directly from the vendor, but through a broker distributor, we're pursuing all those channels.\nThat is creating a bit of a headwind to us.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMichelle, next question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Suisse\n\nHi. Thank you. First one is a clarification on the product order growth number that was reported at 8%. Could you give us an idea on how much price increases contributed to the product order growth number? That's the first question. Just a second question is we're just trying to piece together and explain, even after accounting for the Russia-Ukraine contribution, why enterprise would grow 0% versus some of your peers that are reporting far greater reports and trends in specifically enterprise. Could we just try to maybe triangulate a little bit more about what's going on there?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nOkay. First, I'll let Scott add on the price increase in a moment.\nFirst of all, the price increase really did not have significant impact on our growth. We only passed through pricing at the time that was offsetting our incremental cost. To be honest, we've incurred more costs since then. We're at a place right now where we have not even passed through all the costs that we have incurred. We're getting price increases all the time now. That's the first answer. On the second one, the easiest thing for me to tell you is what I said earlier, that the way our peers view and report and the industry views and reports enterprise would be the combination of our enterprise and commercial business, which last quarter would have grown 9% and would have grown 12% without, or it grew 9%, but would have been 12% without Russia.\nIf you think about the size of those two businesses combined growing 9%, I'm pretty comfortable with that, that the demand is still there. If you look at our commercial business, which usually is the leading indicator of a shift of demand momentum, they grew 19% in the quarter. I'm not concerned.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Sam, to the first part of your question, the 160 basis point impact that we saw in Q3 from pricing is a revenue statement. Obviously, to go from bookings to revenue, it first has to flow through the backlog and then get realized. The impact on bookings, while we haven't quantified it, would be a little bit higher than that 160 basis points.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for the question.\nI want to come back because I think the main investor question coming out of this will be these product orders, Chuck. I know you're saying that combined that they heard all the things that you said there. I think that if you look at the sequential movement on those, it's quite a bit below normal seasonality. Even if you give the 10% growth on a year-over-year basis on the product orders, you're still down mid-single digits sequentially. That's way below normal seasonality. We know that we're coming off historical highs on these product orders. What I'm wondering is if you can give us any idea on trajectory on product orders as we head into next quarter.\nBecause I could see a scenario where product orders decline to kind of 2019 July levels, in which case you'd be down double digits, but you'd still be in good product order territory, if that makes any sense. I'm hoping maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on what you think that trajectory looks like and how those orders are normalizing over time. I have a follow-up. I mean, that's kind of a long question. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nNo, I got you. I got you, Rod. You're actually thinking about it the right way. You're thinking about it exactly the way I'm thinking about it. First thing I'll say is that I think any seasonality right now is out the window with the current situation and with what we've seen with the order demand. We're doing 18-month planning with certain customers.\nIf they placed 18 months' worth of orders last quarter and now they're going to pause, we may be doing it with three fewer customers this quarter. I mean, it's a very difficult thing to get your head around. There are two things that I look at. Number one, what is our quarterly growth rate vis-à-vis a year ago to see? I think about momentum of demand from one quarter to the next, so you have to look at that delta, right? If you grow 30% on 1% and then you grew 30% on 15%, then that would be declining demand momentum. That's the way I think about the math, right? That's one thing we watch for. The second thing is, I think, to your point, I've been talking to the team about it.\nWhen we start comparing against these 30% quarters, I think we have to go back two years and get a real assessment because those numbers we know had pulled ahead in. We don't know how much, as we've talked about, but I think you're right. We have to sort of do an analysis from two years back to really feel like what are we really seeing right now. It's going to be a difficult thing for us to navigate because the historical way we've looked at these metrics just won't apply right now. I think once we cycle through another four quarters of this stuff, maybe we get to a normalized view. As I've said, we're going to go through a phase where our order demand growth will be lagging our revenue growth.\nHopefully, we'll get to a point where those two will get back into more of a predictive model. We just got to get there.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that's great. Chuck, on that subject, I know you talk to a lot of CIOs, CEOs. What are people thinking now? I mean, it seems like everywhere you look, there's bad news, and it's hard to believe people are feeling like they want to spend a lot of money. I'm curious. Yet, the demand still seems pretty good. I'm just curious what you're hearing from people, how the tone of conversations is going.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nI think COVID changed everything about how our customers think about technology. I think that pre-COVID, a lot of customers, when they went to slow spending, they would stop spending on technology.\nI think COVID had them feel the impact of those decisions. They're going to be very prudent about stopping key projects that are giving them customer differentiation capabilities, modernization of their infrastructure, supporting hybrid work, or making sure they're not falling behind their competitors. I mean, it's just a different day today relative to what CEOs and public sector leaders, how they think about technology and the importance of it. Even though they thought it was really important three years ago, their understanding of it today is just much different. I'm not saying they won't make those decisions. I just think there's a higher bar for them to make those decisions.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, guys.\nI still have difficulties to model next year because we still didn't even start comparing the high growth rates of orders. We're still comparing 10% to 10% of last year. Next quarter, you're getting to 30. You have multiple quarters of 30%. At that point of time, revenue growth should accelerate just because the supply chain is supposed to get better somewhere or your actions. We're seeing order growth decelerating instead of accelerating. When we look at the next few quarters, could there be a combination of both order growth going down materially, maybe even to negative levels, at the same time also revenue growth being negative? I mean, I'm trying to understand how to think about the next few quarters. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYou want to take it, Scott?\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah.\nTao, I think the way to think about it is back to one of the statistics that we gave you first time last quarter, then again this quarter. We've got backlog now of greater than $15 billion in product, and within that, more than $2 billion of software sitting in backlog. You add that to the $30-plus billion of RPO we've got, and we're sitting on about $45 billion of sales we've transacted that have not yet accreted to the revenue line. I think as you think about the way you want to model out next year, you need to think about the rate and pace of revenue growth being dependent on supply versus being dependent on in-quarter bookings growth. That's certainly the way I think about it.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nWhen you think about the order trends, I mean, orders, it's dollars, but not all the products have the same trends. Some of the products that are very big in terms of contribution, like service provider side, etc., I have to guess that the trends there are better than the trends in the enterprise, etc. Does it mean the order numbers that you provide, can you dig in a little bit deeper below just a single number for orders and tell us the areas where order growth is better and the areas where order growth is actually worse?\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. I think some of that is available in the slides that we'll put up online. It may also be in the press release. We talked about enterprise.\nEnterprise orders were flat for the quarter, but you have to normalize in the impact of the Russia and Belarus, the decision to stop operations in Russia and Belarus. That would take it up to 3% growth in orders. That's following a quarter where enterprise grew 37%, and the quarter before that, it grew 30%. With these, the way we define enterprise, as Chuck talked about, it's our biggest customers. That business, by definition, is going to be a bit lumpy. On a trailing 12 months, it's actually quite strong. We continue to see nice growth in SP, particularly in web scale. We gave you some of those stats during the call as well. Those are doing well. Public sector continues to hold up. Public sector demand has continued to be fine for us.\nCommercial, you remember we talked about this when we first went into the pandemic that we saw commercial tip down before the rest of the sales tip down. Then as things began to recover in late fiscal 2020, we saw commercial tip up. It tends to be a leading indicator for us. Commercial growth, order growth was up 19% last quarter. If that's the leading indicator, and it certainly has been for us, we're not seeing any weakness in demand at this point.\n\nTal Liani\n\nTechnology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Paul. Next question.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Paul Silverstein with Cowen, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAuthor of Cowen Research Report, Cowen\n\nThanks. Guys, if I could ask for two clarifications. First off, I think I heard you cite a $300 million China lockdown, Shanghai revenue impact in Q3. I didn't hear you cite what the expected revenue impact is in Q4.\nCan you share that with us?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nHey, Paul, thanks. Yeah. In Q3, it was very simple for us to articulate it because we know exactly what we were expecting and everything else. We do not have the ability in Q4 to understand when they are really going to open up and how much we are going to get, etc., which caused us to create the range we did. We are just being realistic about what we believe we will be able to get out the door. To actually peg it to power supplies in particular is pretty difficult. I mean, most of the issues that we see right now, the concerning area right now is really getting China opened up again, getting that stuff shipping. We need to see that. Scott, you want to add something?\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah.\nWhat I'd add to that is we give the example of power supplies because that was a constraint in Q3. Part of the issue that we had in Q3 is that constraint came up very late in the quarter, right? When Shanghai went into lockdown, we didn't immediately see that hit. It hit more toward the second half of April, which, of course, was within our quarter. It wasn't within the quarter of many of our peers. There was just no time to recover from that. I don't want you to oversimplify, and I hope I'm not leading you to that. It's not just power supplies. We've got issues in a number of different areas. I tried to give you a sense of scale because I know it's 41,000 unique components. What we said is about 350 have potential supply concerns right now.\nWe're working those every day. Every day, some of them get resolved, and every day, a couple more will come onto that list. Unfortunately, it would be convenient if it was just one or two things and we could say, yeah, here's exactly what those are. It is a very dynamic situation. What we're trying to do, if you zoom up a level, is say, we're not assuming it gets better or worse as we scroll through Q4. That's what's built into the guide.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAuthor of Cowen Research Report, Cowen\n\nChuck and Scott, the obvious question is to that statement of the billion-dollar, billion-plus shortfall in guidance relative to street expectations, is that all the lack of visibility you have, the understandable concern you have with respect to supply? Is that all in the supply portion of the equation?\nGoing back to all the many questions that have been asked about your order book, the slowdown in orders, and the quality of demand, is any of that shortfall in your guidance concern about demand, or is that all on the supply side of the equation?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nZero. There is no demand impact in our Q4 guide.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nIt's 100% supply.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\n100% supply.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAuthor of Cowen Research Report, Cowen\n\nOne other quick clarification on this topic. If we looked at the linearity of your order book, I know normally we talk about linearity of revenue, but if we looked at the linearity of your orders during the quarter, post-quarter up to this call, what will we see?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nIt was normal. Very normal.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAuthor of Cowen Research Report, Cowen\n\nYou've seen no degradation, you'd argue?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nNo.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nMonth three was right in line with normal pattern.\nI think, Paul, the thing to remember is we're a little skewed because we had three quarters of 30%. If we went back a year and a half and I said, we're going to grow 10% product orders on top of a 10% quarter from a year ago, we would have been quite happy with it. We're just worried about it because it's fallen 3 30s when there was a lot of planned purchases built in too. We'll tell you. Obviously, next quarter, we'll have an update. Right now, it doesn't feel like there's any significant shift.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAuthor of Cowen Research Report, Cowen\n\nChuck, as CINEC would say, you didn't say anything last quarter relative. You're talking, understandably, last quarter about three straight quarters of 30-plus percent growth. You didn't advertise, advise about any expected slowdown. You weren't looking at any slowdown. Now the tune's changed.\nI'm just playing devil's advocate here, obviously.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nPaul, that's fine. We never have any commentary about future bookings expectations.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAuthor of Cowen Research Report, Cowen\n\nOkay, I'll pass it on. I appreciate it.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Paul. Next question.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. David Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks, everyone, for taking the time to take my question. I just had a follow-up on backlog and near-term RPO. If I'm not mistaken, I think your near-term RPO is flat sequentially at roughly $16.2, $16.3 billion. If I tack on sort of a billion increase quarter over quarter in your backlog, given sort of the supply chain constraints that you've articulated and maybe what some of your peers are saying, I'm trying to triangulate on what the revenue trajectory looks like as we go into next year. I mean, you mentioned, Chuck, the seasonality out the window.\nIs it within the realm of possibility that we could start the year next year in the first half at sort of a run rate on where we are today as we exit this year? I mean, is that a realistic probability given on how revenue kind of flows through? I have a quick clarification follow-up.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nSure. On the RPO that we talked about, you got the number right, $16.2 billion of short-term RPO, which is up 9%. Short-term, by definition, means it accretes into the revenue stream in the next 12 months. That growing by 9% is a pretty good leading indicator of at least how that piece of our business looks as we go into Q4.\nWe'll give you an update on how short-term RPO growth looks at the end of Q4, and you can get a sense of it into fiscal 2023.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Maybe just as a follow-up, when you think about where backlog peaks and where maybe purchase order commitments on your end peak, obviously, in our supply chains, kind of throw a lot of sort of the calculation out the window. As you look at your order book and what you see from a demand perspective from your customers, how would you sort of handicap where we think we reach that sort of peak commitment from your perspective to make sure that you have the appropriate components and parts to meet the demand longer term? Right?\nAre we talking about as order growth decelerates from 8% in this quarter and ultimately could decelerate a little bit further, are we a little bit closer to peak on both of those metrics than maybe we thought a quarter or two ago?\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. There's kind of two angles to that, David, that I'll try to touch on. One is when does the backlog itself peak? While we don't forecast that, it would not surprise me to see it grow again in Q4. On the second piece, in terms of purchase commitments, you saw they were up pretty substantially again in Q3, back to the earlier question of, as our supply chain team not being aggressive enough in pursuing parts, purchase commitments now sit at a pretty high level, and inventory sits at a pretty high level.\nThat's so that as we clear the supply constraints on a few critical components, we can actually quickly convert that into finished goods product and get it in the hands of our customers who want those products. Is the peak now, is the peak in Q4 or Q1? Really, a lot depends on the fluidity of availability of these critical components that we're chasing down.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nI hope that makes sense to you. We're sitting on both a record backlog and record inventory, which seems like it's in contrast with one another, but it's not. Right? We're holding on to the parts that we've got, and we just have to get the remainder to square the sets and get those built and out the door.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYeah. No, that makes sense. We're trying to understand sort of your cash flow conversion. That's helpful. Thanks. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next question, please.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Pierre Ferragu, you may go ahead from New Street Research.\n\nPierre FERRAGU\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research",
    "content2": "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Ben Hollis standing in for Pierre. We had a couple of questions. Firstly, you talk about most of your issues arising in April. The full quarter was around 4% to 5% below expectations. Does this mean April activity was around 10% to 15% below your expectations? Secondly, what happens to this demand that you cannot meet in the third and fourth quarter? Do you think it spills over into 2023? What would give you confidence on that? What kind of time frame should we expect that lost demand to be met? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nNo thanks, Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Ben, on the first part of your question, I didn't exactly follow your math.\nRelative to expectations, we talked about the. Yeah. In the month of April, we talked about the. Obviously, the decision we made to stop operations in Russia, Belarus had a $200 million impact for the quarter. Most of that was it was two months of revenue that we had to forgo, and there were some receivables we had to write off within that. On the supply chain side, it would have made up the remainder of that delta to our expectations for the quarter. I hope that answers your question. I'm not quite sure I followed what you were trying to get at with that.\n\nPierre FERRAGU\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nI was just saying that the amount that we said we missed by, if you look at what we would have expected in April from a linearity perspective, it was a certain percentage of it. It's just a mathematical issue.\nIt's probably correct, but we didn't check.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. I don't actually think about it in those terms. I don't either. Yeah. Again, if that didn't answer your question, Ben, we can follow up afterward. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thanks, Scott.\n\nPierre FERRAGU\n\nManaging Partner, New Street Research\n\nHe asked a second one too about the backlog rolling over into 2023.\n\nScott Herren\n\nExecutive Advisor and Retired CFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. I mean, the backlog. A couple of things. I think what you may be trying to get at on the backlog question is the durability of that backlog. This is something that obviously we've been tracking very closely. What I'd say on order cancellations is they continue to run at a rate that is actually below where it was pre-pandemic. We're not seeing any cancellations there.\nWe continue to see very strong pipeline and pipeline build, which is something else that I think you would expect to see weaken if there was softening demand. As we look at kind of further out with what's sitting in the backlog, we've also put in place a policy change that says those orders are non-cancellable, with all orders non-cancellable within 45 days of the committed ship date. That just went into place at the beginning of February. Orders that we've received since then, within 45 days of shipment, are non-cancellable. For our biggest customers, we've been working with them on a bespoke basis to put in place agreements where we'll guarantee supply, but they guarantee that those orders will not be rescheduled or canceled. Feel good about the durability of the backlog we've got.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question.\n\nModerator\n\nTim Long with Barclays.\nYou may go ahead, sir.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Yeah. Two, if I could as well. First, Chuck, the gross margins we talked about was good. A lot of that was pricing. It seems like you guys are in a strong pricing position now. If you look out a few quarters, if and when things normalize, do you think pricing pressure remains, or do you think that's something that will give back to the industry or to the customers? Is that sustainable from a margin standpoint? Second, I was hoping you could dig into software more. I heard a lot of the kind of unique one-time factors in there, but still, even exposed, probably not great growth when you look at the software opportunities ahead of Cisco.\nCould you just give us the things to watch over the next few quarters that could start to re-accelerate growth in that software line?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Tim, on the first one, thank you for the questions, by the way. On the first one, I think that as we see, if we see reductions in our input costs over time, then we'll take into consideration whether we pass those through to the customers. The reality is we've taken on so many input cost increases that we haven't passed on to the customers that we'll look at it holistically at the time where that stuff begins to occur is what I would tell you. I'm glad you asked on the software growth because I think it's something that we want to explain.\nIt's a little difficult to understand completely, and we have a really interesting quarter because of the extra week a year ago, the Russia situation, and the supply chain situation. Let me try to take you through what's going on in software. If you start with the fact that we have well over $2 billion of software in backlog that is connected to a piece of hardware, we will not begin recognizing the revenue until the hardware ships. That's up $1 billion year over year. There's a large component of software that we're not recognizing right now that we would in normal times. That's the first piece. If you take into consideration the extra week from a year ago, where we do ratable recognition of revenue on a daily basis, we had an extra week.\nYou take the software that we wrote down, software revenue that we wrote down as a result of ceasing operations in Russia. The first one is hard to put a number on, but assume it's reasonable. The Russia and the extra quarter was a five-point headwind to our software growth. Anyway, I know it's a little complicated, but I wanted to make sure you understood that. I would expect this stuff to normalize back, particularly without the Russia and the extra week impact. Once supply chain starts to clear, then we'll start to see those normalized growth rates that we would expect. Hopefully, that wasn't too complicated.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nNo, just curious. Any other standalone software or 9K upgrades? Or what are the kind of things outside of the macro-related that could really help?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. The renewal stuff in 2023 could be helpful.\nWe're continuing to make progress on that across the portfolio. I mean, we've got subscriptions running on switching, on routing, enterprise routing, on enterprise wireless. We've even built some subscriptions into our mass scale infrastructure group. We've got subscriptions now in our data center networking group. They'll start layering in over the next few years.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Looks like we have time for one more question.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Amit Daryanani from Evercore? You may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nExperience Senior Managing Director, Equity Research Senior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nPerfect. I'm glad I snuck in here. I will be the dead horse on China's supply chain issues. Maybe if you could ask it from the perspective of the billion-dollar shortfall, and I know it's supply chain, not just China, that you have in July.\nA, what's your conviction that there's no share loss happening because your peers might be one month off, but they've sounded much better? Your conviction that others were not able to get the power analog product that you were not, and they were able to get the demand? A, could you just talk about conviction you are not having share loss? B, China has had no COVID cases in Shanghai for a few days now. Assuming they open up in June, does that imply that you could be perhaps at the higher end of your guide and things get better in Q1? What are you embedding from a Shanghai recovery in your fiscal Q4 guide?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah. First of all, I think market share is an incredibly difficult thing to assess right now because of the backlog situation, supply chain situation.\nWe have a complex portfolio. If you are we losing share in somewhere? I suspect there's somewhere that we are losing share. In our core markets, I actually feel really good about how we're performing and the demand that we've seen in whether it's Wi-Fi, switching, or particularly in SP routing and in the web scale space and other areas. I don't think there's a widespread problem of share, but I'm sure there are pockets that our teams are working on improving. That's the first piece. On the China thing, what we've built into the guide is just a whole lot of uncertainty right now because we recognize that when they do open up, first of all, we don't know what that means. We don't know what open up means.\nDoes it mean that they're going to slowly open grocery stores, salons, and things of that nature, and that the logistics side of it? Or do they open up the logistics all day one? What does it mean about the capacity of resources they have for the logistics side? Our concern is that every company there is going to be trying to ship out. In some cases, many of the factories have been approved to keep working, and their workers have been working in dormitories. They have components or ready-to-ship product that is sitting on the floor. It's all going to race for the ports. It's all going to compete for the airports, and we know there's lower air traffic capacity right now for us to leverage. We're concerned about how long it takes to clear that up, which is reflected in the guide.\nWe also think that once it gets into their ports and it starts coming to the US, we have the risk of seeing what we saw in Los Angeles several months ago. Those are all just the unknowns about what does opening up look like and what's the time frame for recovery that led us to the cautious guide that we put out there. I would just remind you that it's not just Shanghai. I think as of the last article I read, there were like 45 cities that were in lockdown, and it was over a quarter of the population of China. It's broader. That's how we're thinking about it, and we just have to wait and see how it unwinds.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nExperience Senior Managing Director, Equity Research Senior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Amit.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Amit.\n\nOperator\n\nChuck, I'm going to turn it over to you for some closing remarks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChair and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and diving into the complex situation that we face. It's clearly a dynamic and challenging environment. We clearly faced unanticipated events during Q3 with the COVID lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. We think the short-term challenges are ones that we will manage through. Our teams have been working really hard on these mitigation actions that we believe will begin to benefit us in the first half of our next fiscal year, which is good. We're successfully realizing price increases, which is good. Also, in Q3, even though we had a miss on the top line, I just want to point out that it was a record EPS quarter for us as a company. At the low point of our guidance for Q4, we will deliver record EPS for the full year.\nWhile the top line is disappointing, we have navigated this complex year and actually will deliver solid EPS when we're done. The fundamentals are strong, a lot is still in our favor. Demand, business transformations working, the technology transitions and the number that we're participating in. We have great teams around the world, and that leads me to have a high degree of confidence despite the short-term challenges that we face. Thank you all for spending time with us, and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll just wrap it up by saying Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results, will be on Wednesday, 17 August 2022 at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time. This concludes today's call.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the investor relations team. We thank you very much for joining us today.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you for participating on today's conference call. If you would like to listen to the call in its entirety, you may call 800-388-4923. For participants dialing from outside the US, please dial 203-369-3800. This concludes today's call.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Q2 Fiscal 2022 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO, and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.\nThroughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the Q3 and full year of fiscal 2022. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.\nCisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Marilyn. I hope you all are remaining safe and healthy. After the solid results we delivered last year, 2022 is proving to be an even stronger year, fueled by exceptional demand for our solutions and the continued success of our transformation. In Q2, I'm thrilled to say that we delivered another great quarter with double-digit ARR growth and robust product orders, which fueled an all-time high backlog and a strong pipeline. These results underscore the increasing relevance and criticality of Cisco's innovation in the era of digital transformation and cloud, and reinforce my confidence in our ability to deliver growth. We are focused on staying ahead of our customers' most pressing needs as they navigate a dynamic world.\nOur customers are moving faster than ever, driven by the move to hybrid work and hybrid cloud. This requires modernized infrastructure, new security architectures, and accelerated digital transformation. The breadth of our innovative solutions and services at a global scale, combined with our increasing ability to deliver more flexible consumption offerings, is driving even deeper partnerships with our customers across our entire portfolio. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes covering our results in more detail and what we are seeing in the market. We delivered solid top-line growth, combined with margins and earnings that exceeded the high ends of our guidance, despite operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment. The robust demand we saw in Q1 continued into Q2 with product order growth of 33%. Our third consecutive quarter of order growth of 30% or higher, with momentum once again across all geographic regions and customer markets.\nFor example, in our enterprise business, we delivered 37% order growth, the highest in over 12 years, as large customers prioritize investments to modernize their networks, and enable new digital capabilities and resiliency. As more and more becomes digitized, we expect our momentum to continue. We believe the need for highly secure, seamless connectivity, hybrid cloud, and hybrid work solutions, along with edge computing, will drive growth for Cisco. The opportunity ahead of us is clear, as demonstrated by our growing pipeline and record backlog, which more than doubled from a year ago and will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. In our Webex Suite business, we delivered another incredible quarter. Our order growth was up more than 70% year-over-year, which is over 100% growth on a trailing four-quarter basis.\nWe continue to see exceptional performance driven by the rapid pace of adoption of our 400G solutions and our routed optical networking portfolio, which grew over 50%, fueled by the Cisco 8000 product line, Acacia, and Silicon One. We're also seeing tremendous traction with ZR optics as part of the routed optical network strategy. Our optical systems and Acacia businesses both saw significant double-digit growth driven by our Webex customers. The innovations we've invested in over the last several years have positioned us well as the largest players in this space adopt next-generation technologies. Our customers are making strategic decisions on their future roadmap and recognize Cisco's unparalleled portfolio is critical to their strategies. We believe they are still in the early phases of their next-generation platform buying decisions and expect our momentum to continue.\nFrom a product revenue perspective, we delivered another strong and balanced quarter with 9% growth, with broad-based demand across the majority of our product portfolio. This was led by increased customer spending to modernize their networks, securely connect their hybrid workforce, and build out their 5G networks, all with a strong uptake of our subscription offerings. We continue to prioritize investments that will drive our long-term performance and capitalize on the mega trends in large, growing markets, including cloud, full-stack observability, 5G, 400G, Wi-Fi 6, and security. Our expertise in these areas, along with the deep integration of hardware, software, and silicon across our portfolio, differentiates us and sets us up to win. Our team continues to innovate at a speed and scale like never before.\nTo help our customers build and deliver the best hybrid work experience, we recently introduced new breakthrough networking innovations, including Catalyst 9000X switches built on Silicon One, the industry's first high-end Wi-Fi 6E access points, and an as-a-service private 5G offering for the enterprise, enabling communication service providers to deliver cloud-based services to their customers. We are committed to also lead in a more sustainable way. An example of this is our Silicon One Catalyst 9000X switches I just mentioned, which are approximately 40% more power efficient compared to prior versions. Building technologies in this way is key towards our goal to reduce our scope three emissions to net zero by 2040. I'm also proud of the progress of our business transformation to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue, as we transition more of our business to the cloud.\nAnnualized recurring revenue, or ARR, of $21.9 billion was up 11%, with product ARR increasing by 20%. Product remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which is largely software revenue that is committed but not yet recognized, was up 16%. We remain one of the largest software companies in the world. In Q2, our software revenue grew by 6% to 3.8 billion. Total subscription revenue accelerated to 5.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. It's important to note that both of these metrics continue to be negatively impacted by subscription software and service that is attached to hardware where the shipments are delayed due to the component situation. The strength in our software, RPO, and ARR clearly demonstrate the value we are creating through our transformation and provides us a greater degree of visibility and predictability into our future growth. From a macro perspective, the component shortage continues to remain challenging.\nOur incredibly strong demand continues to outpace supply, expanding our backlog of products, software, and services. Our supply chain team continues to take aggressive action through strong inventory positions, deepening supplier relationships, qualifying alternative components, and increased use of expedited freight. There are still significant constraints with semiconductors, preventing us from completing manufacturing of some of our products, and that remains a headwind to revenue growth despite very strong demand. In addition, the constrained environment continues to drive up supply chain costs, which we have successfully passed through to help offset these increases. In summary, we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic and component shortages, and we've never felt better about the company, our position, and our outlook for growth. Our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision, and outstanding execution by our teams.\nOur innovation engine and pipeline have never been stronger, and we are rapidly transforming our business by accelerating our transition to more software and subscription offerings. I am so proud of our teams and what they've accomplished during these very dynamic times. We are bringing industry-leading innovation to market, and further enhancing our differentiated position across the portfolio by delivering flexible consumption models for our customers. I remain confident and optimistic about our future. Cisco is at the epicenter of massive shifts toward hybrid cloud, hybrid work, and digital transformation, which we believe creates momentum for our business and positions us well to capture the significant opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Q2 is a strong quarter across the business.\nWe executed well, delivering our third consecutive quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio, including continued robust demand for our products and services, along with disciplined spend and supply chain management. Total revenue increased by $760 million to 12.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. We saw strength in a number of product areas, and across all of our geographies. Our business performed well in this highly dynamic and supply-constrained environment, which, as Chuck said, continues to hinder our ability to convert the significant demand we have into revenue. Overall profitability in Q2 was strong, with non-GAAP operating margin of 34.3%, non-GAAP net income of $3.5 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84, with non-GAAP earnings per share coming in above the high end of our guidance range.\nLooking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.4 billion, up 9%. Service revenue was $3.4 billion, down 1%, driven by delays in hardware support contracts related to the supply constraints. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks performed well, with revenues up 7%. Switching had solid growth, driven by a double-digit increase in data center switching, driven by our Nexus 9000 products. Campus switching had solid growth, led by our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki switching offerings. Wireless had very strong double-digit increase, driven by our Wi-Fi 6 products, and our Meraki wireless offerings. We also saw double-digit growth in compute revenue, driven by servers. Enterprise routing declined, primarily driven by access, slightly offset by strength in SD-WAN.\nHybrid work, which is where we report just our collaboration portfolio, was down 9%, driven by declines in our collaboration devices and meetings offerings, partially offset by the continued ramp of our communication platform as a service. Beginning next quarter, the name of this category will change from hybrid work to collaboration. There will not be any changes to the components within this category. End-to-end security grew 7%, with broad strength across most of the portfolio. Our zero trust portfolio performed well, with double-digit growth, driven by strong performance in our Duo offerings. Our subscription portfolio continued to perform well, driven by cloud security and zero trust. Internet for the Future was up 42%, driven in large part by the strength of our web scale customers.\nWe saw broad strength in the portfolio, with growth in edge, driven by double-digit growth from our ASR 9000 offerings, and core, with strength in Cisco 8000 and optical. We also saw continued strong contribution from Acacia, our optical networking offerings. Optimized application experiences was up 12%, driven by double-digit growth in both ThousandEyes and Intersight. SaaS revenue for AppDynamics grew mid-single digits, with the continued shift to its cloud-delivered platform. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Software revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 6%, with the product portion up 9%. 80% of software revenue was subscription-based, which is up 4 percentage points year-over-year. Total subscription revenue was $5.5 billion, an increase of 7%. Total subscription revenue represented 44% of Cisco's total revenue.\nAnnualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $21.9 billion, an increase of 11%, with strong product ARR growth of 20%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $30.5 billion, up 8%. Product RPO increased 16%, service RPO increased 3%, and the total short-term RPO grew 8% to $16.3 billion. As a reminder, the short-term portion will convert to revenue over the next 12 months. Relative to acquisitions, there was an approximate 200 basis point year-over-year positive impact on Q2 revenue growth and no material impact on our non-GAAP EPS, which is in line with our expectations. We continue to have exceptionally strong order momentum in Q2. Total product orders grew 33%, with strength across the business. Looking at our geographic segments, the Americas was up 36%, and EMEA and APJC were both up 30%. Total emerging markets were up 39%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 48%.\nIn our customer markets, service provider was up 42%, enterprise was up 37%, commercial was up 34%, and public sector was up 20%. As you can see, it was broad strength across our geographies and customer markets. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin came in at 65.5%, down 140 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.3%, down 230 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 90 basis points. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily driven by ongoing higher component costs related to supply constraints, as well as higher freight and logistics costs. As we've been discussing for several quarters, we continue to manage through the supply constraints seen industry-wide by us and our peers due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply costs. The situation remains challenging.\nWe continue to partner closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our volume purchasing and extended supply commitments as we address the supply challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue into the second half of our fiscal 2022. As I mentioned, the component supply constraints also slow the conversion of our strong demand into revenue. This has resulted in a substantial increase, and continued build, in our backlog levels, well beyond our normal historical levels. Additionally, the ongoing supply constraints have not only impacted our ability to ship hardware, but also impact our delivery of software, such as subscriptions that customers order with the hardware. That undelivered software is also included in backlog until the hardware ships, which is when we begin to recognize the revenue. Of course, this impacts our software revenue growth and other related metrics.\nTo give you a sense of scale of our backlog, our Q2 ending product backlog was more than $14 billion, an increase of more than 150% year-on-year. Within that amount, software backlog almost doubled to more than $2 billion, keeping in mind that backlog is not included as part of our $38.5 billion in remaining performance obligations. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $21.1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.5 billion, down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by advanced payments to secure future supply. These advanced payments had a negative 17% year-over-year impact on operating cash flow. Additionally, we made a tax payment of approximately $100 million this quarter, which had been deferred as a result of the CARES Act. This payment had an additional negative 4% year-over-year impact on our operating cash flow.\nIn terms of capital allocation, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which comprised $4.8 billion of share repurchases, and $1.5 billion for our quarterly cash dividend. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our board has authorized an additional $15 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total to approximately $18 billion. We are also raising our dividend by one penny to 0.38 per quarter, which represents our 12th increase. The combination of our dividend increase, additional share repurchase authorization, and higher share repurchases during the quarter demonstrates our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and our confidence in the stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. We closed the acquisition of Replex in Q2 and Opsani in early Q3 to enhance our full-stack observability offerings.\nThese investments are consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation and R&D with targeted M&A to allow us to further strengthen and differentiate our market position, and our key growth areas. To summarize, we had another good quarter with robust product demand and solid execution in a complex, supply-constrained environment. We continue to make progress on our business model shift and are making the investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities and expanding addressable markets. We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue, delivering growth and driving shareholder value. Now let me provide our financial guidance for Q3. As a reminder, the Q3 of last year included an extra week, which was a benefit to total revenue of approximately 3% of growth.\nThe total impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million, and this translated into a $0.04 benefit to earnings per share in our Q3 of last year. For next quarter, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5, reflecting the continuing increase in supply chain costs we're incurring as we protect shipments to our customers. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.85 to 0.87. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we're tightening the range as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5 year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is increasing to 3.41% to 3.46, up 5.9% to 7.5 year-on-year.\nIn both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer, you may go ahead.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Hey, guys. Nice to see the good results. I want to dig into the supply chain a little bit, Chuck and Scott. Maybe you can talk about just kind of quarter over quarter, have things gotten a little bit worse, a little bit better, and is there any timetable in mind where you think we could see a material improvement?\nMaybe on the back of that, Scott, when we see this improvement, should we just expect a period of, I don't know, two, three quarters where you really have outsized growth as you fulfill this unusual backlog? I'm just trying to understand the scenario here of how all of this gets unwounded.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Ittai, thanks for the question. I'll start, and then Scott can jump in. I would say during the quarter, supply chain didn't get materially worse and didn't really get materially better. It was pretty consistent. There were gives and takes throughout the quarter, but I think at a macro level, that's the way I'd characterize it. There were a little bit towards the end of some Omicron effect with people being sick and not being able to show up in factories, and some of the logistics issues that are well documented.\nIn general, that's what we saw. We don't have—I wouldn't say we have a great timeline for you as to when things begin to improve. All we know now is we expect this to be with us through the second half of our year. Scott, what would you add?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, no, I think that's right. That's in sync with our expectations. Ittai, to your question on how does this unwind, I don't believe it unwinds in a lumpy fashion. I think it'll unwind as supply and demand get more in balance. I think that'll just happen gradually over the course of the next few quarters. I'm not expecting a significant bump in any given quarter. I think the supply frees up with $14 billion of backlog. We've got plenty of demand to go off and fulfill.\nIt's really a question of when does that supply free up? As it does free up, I think it will happen gradually over time.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGot it. Maybe, Scott, just to clarify this last point, is there any way for you to know how much of this backlog is double ordering? I don't know what it means from a customer standpoint that you have all this backlog. Are customers really waiting for a long time to product? What is the risk you have some kind of double order elements in these figures?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nIttai, that's something that we've been alert to and watching for since we began building the backlog after three consecutive quarters of demand growth in the 30% range and revenue growth only in the 6% to 8 range. We've been building substantial backlog, and so we've been looking to that.\nI think it's clear that customers are responding to our lead times, and our lead times have extended as the lead times for the components have extended. There's, I'd say, some extension in there. I think what we're seeing is real demand. I think it's a combination of pent-up demand from products that didn't get done during the pandemic. I think it's the leading edge of several of these trends that we've talked about, that we're investing into. When we look at things like if there was double ordering, you probably wouldn't see that as much in the commercial and small customers, and we're still seeing strong growth in that segment. You probably also would see the pipeline build begin to slow down, and we're not seeing that either. Our pipeline is quite robust at this point.\nWe're looking for proxies to try to understand that better. We're not seeing anything at this point that would indicate there's double ordering in there.\n\nIttai Kidron\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Ittai. Next question, please.\nPaul Silverstein from Cowen, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThanks, guys. I guess, is there anything wrong with the following logic with respect to your elevated costs? At some point, logistics rate costs are going to return to normal, if not entirely back to where they were a year, year and a half ago, largely. As far as the stickier component and semiconductor costs, to the extent they don't revert, your price increases eventually over the next three or four quarters as you burn off backlog, they will offset, if not in full and large measure, those elevated costs. Before I ask the follow-up, is there anything wrong with that logic?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nI think, Paul, there's nothing wrong with the logic. I think the expectations that I would give you are the same that I gave you last quarter. As I think about gross margin through the end of this fiscal year, I think it stays in the range we're in, in the 64% to 65 range through the end of the year. Beyond that, as you said, and I hope you're right, that logistics costs begin to return to something that's more normal. Obviously, the price increases that we put in place, we've talked about this previously. We're not seeing much benefit from that today because the price increase goes in, there's offsets between the time we start it and it gets out to the field. The field then has to take those prices, sell it to customers.\nThose orders have to come into the backlog and then get fulfilled out of the backlog before we finally get the revenue credit for those price increases. I think that we'll begin to see benefit from those price increases toward the end of this quarter and more into Q4. My expectation on gross margins at this point is that they stay in the range that we're in right now, in this 64% to 65 range, through the end of the year.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nGot it. Chuck, on the revenue side, this is the best demand environment across enterprise, carrier, and web scale I've seen in 26 years of covering the segment. You'd have to go back to the late 1990s, and of course, that proved to be a bubble. We see your growth, the growth of your peers, Arista, Juniper, Extreme, ETHFI, etc.\nHow much of what's going on is pure market growth? How much of this is improved execution on the part of Cisco?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nThat's a really good question, and I would say that it is definitely a combination of both. The markets are certainly robust, as you called out, with seeing some of our peers who are having solid results as well. When you look at—when I look at the order growth rates in certain segments of our business, certain technology areas, I can tell you we're gaining share. I mean, web scale, obviously, we're executing incredibly well because we didn't exist there just a couple of years ago. In some of our technology areas like Wi-Fi, I mean, the growth rates on the order side, even campus switching, the growth on the order side, I think there's a lot of really good execution.\nI think our portfolio is in great shape. You have to remember, we're on the front end of these multi-year trends that are really in our favor, whether it's 5G, whether it's 400G, Wi-Fi 6, hybrid cloud, hybrid work, edge compute. I mean, these are all technology areas and transitions that are positive for us. Those are somewhat market-related, but I think our portfolio is well-positioned for those transitions.\n\nPaul Silverstein\n\nAnalyst, Cowen\n\nThank you, Chuck.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nSami Badri from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nHi. Thank you very much. I got two hard questions for you guys. I'll keep this second one short, but here's the first one. I want to congratulate you guys on the 30% plus product order growth.\nI think what a lot of us really want to know is, what is the right normalized growth rate, or when do you see the normalized growth rate finally starting to flow through your numbers? We look at the 30% and think this is a thematic trend, but at some point, it needs to come back down a little bit. When do you see the normalization of that product order growth actually happen? That's the first question. The second question is a $20 billion question. Are you guys buying Splunk? If not, what have been the internal considerations for not doing the deal?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nLet me answer, I guess, both of them. On the first one, I think that next quarter, Q3, the compares definitely get tougher from a year ago, particularly because we had an extra week of order as well.\nIn Q4, obviously, that was the first quarter that we experienced the 30%+ quarter from last fiscal year. Certainly, those will be good quarters for us to sort of see a litmus test on your question. Until then, I'm not sure I have a direct answer for you, but certainly, the math will get tougher here in the next couple of quarters. On your second question, first of all, we don't comment on rumors and speculations or stories. What I will tell you is that we are constantly evaluating potential opportunities. Scott and I were talking, and we think for every deal we do, we probably look at 10 to 15 companies. We base our decisions on, first and foremost, strategic fit, secondly, cultural fit, and, equally as important, the financial and evaluation fit.\nWe are always disciplined, and we continue to focus on both inorganic and organic opportunities. I will tell you that you should expect us to continue to be very, very disciplined as we go forward as well.\n\nSami Badri\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nRod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. I wanted to come back to gross margins for the quarter. You guys substantially beat the top end of your guidance range. I wanted to see if you could just comment on what were the positive surprises within that gross margin line. My second question, maybe kind of a non-sequitur, but I was really surprised, Chuck, on the public sector orders. Those were really strong.\nI wonder if you could maybe dig into that a little bit and comment on some of the dynamics there in the public sector. Thanks.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nI'll take the first one on the gross margin, Rod. It really came down to product mix that we had the components for that we could build and ship out during Q2. As I said earlier, our expectations on gross margin for the year are unchanged. We had favorable product mix in Q2 that drove us above, as I'm sure you're aware, above the high end of our guidance range. I think it's a bit of a headwind for us as we look at gross margins in Q3, but it equals out for the year. Our expectations for the full year on gross margin are unchanged.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nScott, can you comment on specifically what types of products mixed in positively there?\nJust give us a little more color.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nIt's always a mix. When you go across product lines and across customer size, both of those things have an effect. Rather than kind of go through and parse product by product, we had a quarter where the supply we had just allowed us to ship higher margin product. Again, given the visibility we have with sitting on $14 billion of backlog, we have pretty good visibility into what we need to build, and a pretty good feel for what that's going to look like in the quarters ahead. Feel confident that we're going to stay in this range through the end of the year.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nOn the public sector question, I think it's a good catch on your part because a lot of people look at the 20% and see it as being below the other customer markets and would look at that negatively. The reality is it's been the most consistent for the last couple of years. We saw broad-based strength, and whether it was in our government business, which has been, I think we've had, I'm looking at some data here, six consecutive quarters of positive growth and three out of the last four strong double-digit growth. You look at education, we've had five straight quarters or six straight quarters there as well. It's been particularly strong the last five quarters. It was very broad-based across the public sector.\n\nRod Hall\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Okay. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Rod. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nTim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you.\nYeah, I just wanted to ask on the software side, decent year-over-year growth in the quarter. I understand it's still being hampered a little bit, but maybe just talk a little bit, Chuck, about when you think we'll start to see that accelerate a little bit more than the overall revenues. Is it CAT and UNK? Is it some other products moving to more software? Is it recovery in some of the other businesses? The follow-up is on the cloud business. You talked about the strong orders again. Could you just give us a little color of kind of what's driving that? More than just product basis, are you seeing competitive wins, new use cases, new customers? What's really driving that 70% year-over-year and 100% over the last four quarters? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nI'm pulling out some data here.\nTim, on the first one, on the software front, I think you have a really good question. I think Scott called out in his section that our product software revenue growth was 9%. You got to get behind that to understand what's going on. Our old Perpetual software, which we've been in transition from to subscriptions, Perpetual was down 12% and subscription was up 17%. The transition is actually happening the way we expect it. That's the reason you're seeing some of the—because the subscription stuff obviously is recognized over time, and you're taking a 12% hit on a one-time piece of software from the way we used to sell it. You have that dynamic that just has to continue to play out.\nYou have the renewals that you mentioned starting to come through on some of the DNA stuff in earnest in 2023, and then 2024, 2025 beginning to ramp. You have over $2 billion of software sitting in backlog that is not in RPO yet because it's connected to a piece of hardware that hasn't shipped. We recognize a bit of that upfront, and then the rest over time. We have all of those variables in play right now. All that being said, I think you should expect when we get to a normalized world, I would expect that once we get this supply chain and the backlog clear, in a normal world, I would expect you would see software revenue growth growing faster. Right now, with our backlog so big, that may not happen for several quarters.\nYeah, that $2 billion of software, it's a little bit more than $2 billion sitting in our backlog right now. That's almost double where it was just a year ago, right? There's always some that'll sit in backlog, but it's almost double. Of course, most of that software is recognized ratably, so the ramp, once we can get it cleared out of the backlog and shipped, we're still going to have a ratable ramp on that. Longer term, if you remember what we said in September, we said the recurring revenue parts of our product business, we expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 17%. That's what we just put up, right? The product subscription piece in our software business grew 17% in the quarter. I think we're right on track in that space.\nI'm trying to find that breakdown of the different franchises in web scale. Where was that? Do you remember?\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nYep. Let me get it for you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nOkay. On the cloud side, I think I just have it. No, I don't have it in front of me. On the cloud side, here's what I would tell you is that we are winning, continuing to win new use cases with our integrated systems, Silicon One systems, as well as we have won use cases where they're simply buying our hardware, meaning a switch that they're running their operating system on. We have certain customers that are running multiple consumption models where one may be buying silicon and they also buy the hardware switch. One may be buying an integrated system and silicon. It's a variation of all of those, and we are winning new competitive use cases.\nI don't think that's not what I'll wait for.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nOkay.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nIt's a—sorry, I was just—Marilyn was trying to find it, but I was going to tell you the number of customers and how many franchises we've won inside each, but I don't have that in front of me right now. We'll try to get that. In general, we are definitely winning the use cases.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Vogt from UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nEquity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to capital allocation for a second. Over the last five years, you've been pretty consistent in deploying free cash flow to dividends, buybacks, although that materially accelerated in the quarter, and acquisitions.\nCan you kind of expand on your philosophy over the next several years with respect to potential uses going forward, given the recent increase in the buyback today? Has your position around leverage and the use of leverage changed? Ultimately, what amount of cash flow would you be comfortable with on the balance sheet to run the business, given the order strength that you're seeing, the working capital needs, and supply chain uncertainty?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThere's a lot in there, David. What I'd start by saying is the buyback that you saw, the additional buyback that you saw in Q2, and the add to our outstanding authorization to take it up to just short of $18 billion, and the one penny increase in dividend, those are all signs of the confidence we have in our business, and the growth we see ahead.\nSince 2018, we have returned, as you alluded to, we've returned $76 billion in capital to shareholders just since 2018. There's no change in our overall cap allocation policy to answer that question for you. It starts with, first and foremost, supporting the growth of the business through both organic and inorganic means. Obviously, we'll support the dividend. We'll, at a minimum, offset the dilution of our equity plans, and beyond that, return excess cash to shareholders, as you just saw us just do. There's no change in our overall policy. In terms of working capital, we've got, I would wager to say, the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Certainly, amongst our peers, we've got the strongest balance sheet out there. I don't feel like we're constrained at all by the amount of cash we have to keep on the balance sheet to support operations.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nEquity Analyst, UBS\n\nMaybe just as a quick follow-up to that, along the same lines, obviously, you talked about culture, tech fit, and ultimately making it work financially if there is an M&A opportunity on the horizon. I think historically, you haven't really used your balance sheet as aggressively using leverage to do a transaction. I mean, does that fit with how you're thinking about the business going forward? Is that a consideration, or should we expect to be in sort of the same ranges from a leverage perspective, whether it's measured on gross or net debt perspective or cash perspective in your case?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, I don't actually think of it in those terms as it relates to M&A. It's more back to what Chuck said earlier. Is it a strategic fit? Is it a cultural fit? Does the valuation make sense?\nThose are the kind of considerations that come into play as we're thinking about M&A versus what's the strength of the balance sheet. Again, I would stack our balance sheet up against anyone.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nEquity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, Scott.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nI want to jump back in real quick and give Tim the double click that I was looking for on the use cases. We have five players who use our customers who use Silicon One and Cisco 8000 systems. We have two that use Silicon One with the 8000 series routers with their own operating systems. We have two that use Silicon One embedded in their own white box hardware. We have three that use at least two of the flexible consumption modes simultaneously. That's the data that I was trying to get to, Tim.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Chuck. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nMeta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks.\nMaybe just a question on passing through pricing to customers, just what those conversations are like maybe by category of customer, and just whether you're seeing larger orders in an attempt to kind of offset some of those pricing increases. Then maybe a second question for you, Chuck, just as you're starting to see customers move towards more architecture modernization versus just kind of catch-up spend, and maybe more specifically by enterprises, what are some of the strongest themes that you're seeing in terms of that modernization?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nThanks. Yeah. Thanks, Meta. I think that clearly we have customers who are definitely trying to buy ahead of price increases. The conversations are they've gone from, I'd say, being generally understanding to being a little more frustrated, primarily because of the length of time it's taken to get the product.\nThey're running out of patience as we all are. Everybody generally understands because, candidly, most of our customers are probably doing the same thing to their customers in whatever business they're in, in general, given the inflationary pressure that we see everywhere. That's the first one. The second one on the architectural transformations that we see out there, there's a massive one that is really being driven by hybrid work. Re-architecting your entire network infrastructure to deal with distributed applications, distributed users, distributed data, a new security architecture to accommodate it. That's one. Obviously, within that is hybrid cloud where you have applications running in multiple cloud providers as well as in private data centers.\nI mean, the demand we saw for our data center switching portfolio was extremely strong, in addition to UCS, which tells me that customers are still investing in private data centers as well. That creates traffic patterns that are not aligned with the architectures that our customers built over the last 15 years. That's the first one. There are these transitions that I talked about earlier. You've got customers upgrading to 400G. We're almost at 700 customers now who have 400G ports. We've now taken orders for 737,000 ports. We had 200,000-plus ports booked in the quarter, which is almost 1,500% growth. 400G is certainly taking off. The Wi-Fi 6 transition has been pretty significant, and those are just some of the things we see.\nIn the service provider space, you see 400G, you see the 5G transition, and you see them building out enterprise services based on 5G. Those are some of the major transitions that we see.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nJim Suva from Citigroup. You may go ahead.\n\nJim Suva\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThank you. Scott, you had mentioned margins, and I think you'd mentioned at this level through the rest of the year. I just want to qualify, was that for the calendar year or fiscal year? A little bit of color because my understanding is as you put through product price increases, customers who may have already booked things prior to those increases will still get the product, but you're still paying higher shipping costs and potentially component costs.\nI wonder if in the second half of calendar year 2023, if actually margins could expand or maybe they just offset each other. Thank you.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah, I think you're thinking about it the right way, Jim. A lot of what we have in the backlog were products that were ordered pre the price increases, certainly the latest round of price increases. Logistics costs are still with us. As I said earlier, I think that if you remember, we've had a couple of rounds of price increases, and I think we begin to see the benefit of that first one toward the end of Q3 and expect to see it again in Q4.\nWith the level of visibility we have, both $16 billion of short-term RPO, $30 billion of total RPO, and add to that $14 billion of backlog, we have better visibility than we've ever had as I look ahead. Feel good that the gross margins will stay in that 64% to 65 range through the second half. That is of the fiscal year, is what I'm talking about, the second half of our fiscal year.\n\nJim Suva\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThank you so much for the details, and congratulations.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Jim. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nTal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Directtor and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi guys. I have questions on two of your segments. The first one is on security. Your trends are kind of not correlated with the industry trends. First, the previous two quarters you slowed down materially, but now you're accelerating again. There was acceleration over the last two quarters.\nCan you explain why you're seeing these trends, why we see acceleration as much as why we saw deceleration before? Second is the service revenues. This is the fourth quarter of deceleration. We got to negative territories for growth now. Can you also explain services and how should we model it going forward?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Tal, thanks for the question. I'll take security and I'll let Scott talk about services. I know he did some work on that. On the security front, I would say that we have strengthened several areas of that portfolio, particularly a lot of the SaaS elements that we have in the portfolio. We do have some supply chain issues that are continuing with the firewalls. Again, the SaaS and software components grew at a healthy rate.\nThe teams that are working on a next-generation strategy right now, and I feel confident that over the next 12 to 18 months, you should continue to see improvement in that business. We also need to get supply chain issues dealt with on the firewall front. Scott, you want to talk about services?\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nYeah. Tal, on the services piece, what you have to bear in mind is two things. Most of that's routable, and most of that is the support services we sell attached to hardware. There's always a lag, right? When you build up a big routable revenue base, it takes time to build it up. It takes a while to ramp up to speed, but it also takes time for it to come back down.\nIf you look at our product revenue rates, go back 12, 18 months. During the midst of the pandemic, of course, our product growth rates were quite low. The echo effect of that is we sold fewer services contracts when we're selling less revenue. It takes time for that to show up in the revenue stream because so much of that's routable, and it builds up in deferred revenue and bleeds out over time. What we're dealing with now is just the tail of the services that would have been attached to the hardware at a time when hardware sales, if you go back 12 to 18 months ago, were fairly low.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Directtor and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Got it.\n\nScott Herren\n\nCFO, Cisco\n\nThe flip side is, look at the growth of our RPO at $30.5 billion, growing 8%. Obviously, the routable services fit inside there.\nThe short term at $16.3 billion, growing 8%, gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks like. That's both services and software, but it gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks like.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Directtor and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nThanks, Tal. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nEmmett Derani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managign Director, Evercore",
    "content2": "Yep. Thanks for taking my question, I guess the first one I have is really on the campus side, on the campus solution side. I'd love to understand, Scott, how do you think that segment or product portfolio stacks up as we go through the rest of the year and we get back to some form of hybrid work? Also on campus, I think a lot of your peers, if not every one of your peers, has talked about thinking of market share. You have the dominant position there.\nI'd love to understand what you're seeing in the marketplace and the ability to defend share given everyone's talking about it. Yeah. I mean, I could not understand the first part of your question. Would you like to repeat that one? Yeah. Chuck, I was just trying to understand on the campus side, how do you think that segment stacks up for the year as we go back into some form of hybrid work? Then competitively, a lot of your peers have talked about picking up share. How do you see that market share dynamic play out?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nGot it. Okay. What we believe we're seeing is this pure modernization that's occurring. We see densification of Wi-Fi networks in particular.\nWe're seeing more and more access points per workspace than what was pre-COVID to just ensure reliability, which then falls through to requiring a more robust switching infrastructure to support it. We believe customers are preparing for putting more and more video units into conference rooms, which will be hardwired, which drives more switch ports. We have more security cameras that are IP-based that are going in. IoT is beginning to expand, connecting building automation systems, and all of those things just require an incredibly robust and resilient campus network. We think that's what's going on. On the second question, market share is a funny thing, and it's obviously based on revenue. I can tell you that based on the growth rates from an orders perspective and how much of that is sitting in our backlog, I'm not concerned.\nI cannot imagine that the market is growing faster than the order growth that we've seen over the last three quarters. It just needs to go through the revenue.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managign Director, Evercore\n\nFair enough. Chuck, if I could just ask you a quick one. What scenario would it take for Cisco to start doing buybacks above just offsetting dilution? Maybe the inverse of this CapEx allocation question, how much cash is too much on your book that you may have to do more aggressive buybacks? Yeah. I mean, you saw we went pretty aggressive into the buyback during Q2, at $4.8 billion in the quarter.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nThat's obviously well beyond what's required just to offset dilution. I think historically, if you look back, you'll see we've been pretty aggressive on share buybacks over the last several years, with the dividend and share buybacks returning $76 billion since 2018.\nI don't think there's a change in stance or a change in demeanor as we look at that. We're constantly evaluating where we are from a cash standpoint, what our needs are. I told you the priority of our CapEx allocation policy has not changed. Support the growth of the business organically and inorganically first. The dividend, anti-dilution, and beyond that will return cash to shareholders. I think that's the way you need to think about it going forward. There's no real change in policy, but you saw us get pretty aggressive in the first half of Q2. Perfect.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managign Director, Evercore\n\nThank you. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nThank you.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nYep. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two quick ones.\nChuck, you talked about the strength that you're seeing with web scale customers within the service provider customer segment. Maybe you can give us some details about what you're seeing from telcos and cable, and the strength as well as what visibility they're providing you at this point. For my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to orders again. Your enterprise orders did accelerate from 30% to, I think, 37% from first quarter to second. Is there a composition of early orders that's driving that acceleration, or are you seeing an underlying acceleration? Can you just kind of help us think through that? Thank you.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, Sam. On the service provider space, I'd say just to give you a general sense, I gave you the web scale numbers at over 70%, I'd say, and the overall service provider segment was 42%.\nCable was roughly flattish, give or take a point or two. The telco space was incredibly strong, incredibly strong for us. Both the web scale and the telco space were the key contributors to that 42% growth. On the second question, what was the second question?\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nEnterprise growth.\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nEnterprise growth. Thank you. Yeah. When you look at it across, I mean, whether you look at it across the geographies or you look at it generally across our product portfolio or even across verticals, it was just super consistent. I mean, every customer seems to be moving right now. I don't think there's not one specific thing to call out. It was pretty broad-based.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nOkay. I think that was our last question for the call. Chuck, do you want to close with some closing remarks?\n\nChuck Robbins\n\nChairman and CEO, Cisco\n\nYeah, I do, Marilyn.\nThank you. First of all, I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish in Q2 despite the ongoing component demands or component dynamics, the product order growth, the revenue, EPS, the ARR growth, the RPO growth, the balanced growth across the world. Really pleased with our continued success in web scale, and just happy that our customers are choosing our technology as they continue down this digital transformation path. I think it speaks to the relevance and criticality of what we're building and what our teams have built. I want to just take a minute to thank all the Cisco employees because it's been an incredibly difficult couple of years. I think the team has showed a great deal of resiliency, delivered breakthrough innovation, and really done everything we can to take care of our customers.\nThanks for spending time with us today, and we'll talk to you next time.\n\nMarilyn Mora\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Cisco\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next Quarterly Earnings Conference Call, which will reflect our fiscal 2022 Q3 Results, will be on Wednesday, 18 May 2022 at 1:30PM Pacific Time, 4:30PM Eastern Time.

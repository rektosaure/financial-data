Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. For information concerning these risk factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent quarterly or annual SEC filings, all of which are available on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Edmund Reese, our CFO. The financial presentation, which Edmond will reference in his remarks is posted on our website. To begin today, we want to recognize the great trauma and suffering resulting from Hurricane Melissa.\nWe're thinking about everyone affected by this terrible catastrophe, and we feel very, very humble and hopeful, but the work Aon undertook with the World Bank to arrange a cap on for the government of Jamaica will accelerate in support recovery. .\nTurning now to AOP. Our third quarter results reflect another quarter defined by continued acceleration of our Aon United strategy, great progress executing on our 3x3 plan and financial model and ongoing momentum as we head into the final months of the year. Our focus on execution is translating into value delivery to our clients, while at the same time producing results for our firm and strong financial performance.\nWe're winning more in the core by deepening relationships with existing clients through data-led solutions, capturing demand in existing markets by developing new capabilities for emerging risks and creating demand in new categories by innovating unique capital solutions. And we're strengthening our clients' insurance programs to ensure they are positioned well for the future with enhanced coverage and limits. Let's start with a look at our third quarter highlights. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results. highlighted by 7% organic revenue growth, a 26.3% adjusted operating margin and 12% adjusted EPS growth, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year objectives. Our continued success in winning new business and deepening client relationships reflects the strength of our risk capital and human capital capabilities powered by ABS.\nSimply put, our analytic capabilities enable smarter and faster decisions for clients, which when coupled with our advisory expertise, helps clients capture greater opportunity. And while any firm can point to client wins, 2 highlights from this quarter truly demonstrate the impact of our differentiated strategy. The first example demonstrates how our advanced analytic capabilities were critical in securing our appointment as the captive insurance partner for a leading global logistics company. replacing a competitive relationship that span decades.\nOur ability to deliver global expertise with local leadership provided the client with relevant insights into captive management and the risk capital structure, making Aon the clear choice. And as an example, by demonstrating our distinctive client service and enterprise mindset to the enterprise client group, we not only retained but expanded our benefits work with a long-standing financial services client in an intensely competitive process.\nWe leverage deep industry knowledge and governance, risk management and employee experience. And this resulted in securing global benefits across new, existing geographies, U.S. H&B and Total Benefits Administration. Our proactive approach combining innovation, analytics and advisory continues to deliver measurable impact and position us for sustained success as our solutions have never been more relevant for clients.\nOur latest 2025 Global Risk Management survey revealed a significant shift in the risk landscape and how decision-makers are thinking about risk. Trade and geopolitical volatility entered the top 10 global risk for the first time in nearly 2 decades, reflecting growing global uncertainty.\nAt the same time, climate risk and natural disasters also reached their highest ever rankings, underscoring the need of resilience in a world where severe weather events are driving up costs. and workforce-related risks continue to have a growing impact on how employers manage affordability, access and productivity. In addition, investments in AI are surge in demand for cloud infrastructure and are fueling unprecedented investment in data center construction with CapEx estimated to exceed $2 trillion globally over the next several years. These technological developments are not only reshaping physical infrastructure but also amplifying cyber and operational risk.\nActive risk management in this area has become a strategic necessity and traditional approaches alone unsufficient to cover this risk. With connected risk capital and human capital capabilities we're truly uniquely positioned to guide clients through a complex environment, access capital, unlock value and build resilience. As we review our performance this quarter, several strategic milestones demonstrate progress on our 3x3 plan. These achievements are the direct result of our team's dedication, collaboration and focus on advancing priorities.\nFirst, Talent remains a significant driver of sustained growth. And the competitive environment for attracting and retaining top performance is as intense as ever. No company is immune, which makes it essential to stay focused and deliberate in our approach. In this environment, our platform is a unique advantage in attracting talent and helping client-facing talent win more business and retain clients, especially in priority areas like construction, energy and health.\nRevenue-generating talent is up 6% net year-to-date, reflecting our strong position and differentiated capabilities. We have a great team, and we remain focused on continuing to strengthen it. Second, our enhanced capital strength gives us greater flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy with discipline and precision. We divested the NFP Wealth business, an asset better suited to an owner prepared to make the capital investment required for long-term growth.\nAt the same time, we remain highly committed to our core wealth and retirement offerings, which represent key components of our human capital value proposition. Also during the quarter, NFP closed more than $10 million in acquired EBITDA as part of programmatic M&A. We have a great pipeline of high-return middle market opportunities and our improved capital position reinforces our commitment to long-term strategic investment and shareholder returns. And finally, equipped with better data and analytics built from years of investment. We're mobilizing capital into the industry, particularly to address the rapid expansion of data center construction driven by AI and cloud infrastructure adoption.\nAs highlighted earlier, the opportunity here is monumental. Data center CapEx increased 50% in 2024 and is expected to increase significantly over the next several years as trillions of dollars of CapEx go into the construction of these facilities. Near term, we estimate data center demand could generate over $10 billion in new premium volume in 2026 alone.\nOur globally aligned risk capital and human capital teams are helping clients navigate this transformation and support stakeholders across the value chain, from technology companies to contractors and operators to capital providers, each with unique insurance needs, given the role in the data center development. While still early days, we're excited by the specific accomplishments that showcase our ability to help clients navigate this transformational opportunity. We recently became the risk partner for a leading global engineering focus insurer with a mission to work with them to build significantly greater level of insurance capacity. This work complements the launch of our data center life cycle insurance program a proprietary multiline insurance facility that consolidates coverage for construction, cargo, cyber and operational exposures and offers clients end-to-end risk management and insurance solutions.\nWe're also working to support resilient design and engineering from the outset of these projects to optimize the industry's ability to provide the limits necessary for hyperscaler data center development and management of accumulation risk. Another example of our global distribution analytics and expertise in both traditional and alternative risk transfer is already delivering results is a recent client win or replaced nearly $30 billion in coverage for a top global hyperscaler data center developer for operational data centers and data centers under construction.\nAnd this is just the beginning. Overall, we accomplished a lot this quarter, and there's a lot to be energized by going forward. Our results and the momentum we have going into the final months of the year give us confidence in reaffirming our 2025 guidance. Let me conclude with 2 points. First, our -- and United strategy accelerated through the 3x3 plan and the strength of our financial model are generating strong results today and building momentum for future success. Our unique capabilities and integrated solutions have never been more relevant to clients as we help them reduce volatility, protect their assets and grow their businesses.\nWe're attracting exceptional talent to strengthen our great team. delivering innovative new solutions with unmatched data and insights and building and deepening client relationships. And we're winning more in core markets, capturing new demand in existing markets and creating new demand in new categories.\nAnd finally and most important, to our over 60,000 colleagues around the world, thank you. Thank you for your commitment to our clients, to each other and to our Aon United strategy. Your dedication is the driving force of our firm.\nNow let me turn the call over to Edmund for his resections on the quarter and outlook for the year. Edmun?\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here to discuss our third quarter results, which marked another quarter of disciplined execution on our 3x3 plan and financial model. To frame our discussion, let me highlight the most important factors shaping our third quarter performance. First, our Q3 performance demonstrates continued momentum across the key drivers of sustainable top line growth.\nOur investment in revenue-generating talent enhanced by ABS and our continued expansion in the middle market is translating into strong organic growth. Organic revenue growth of 7% in Q3 serves as another proof point in our ability to execute on each of these drivers, keeping us in line with or ahead of industry performance.\nSecond, we continue to deliver scale improvements in operating leverage through ABS while also investing in talent and capabilities that deepen client engagement and drive new business. We again delivered in Q3, expanding margins over 100 basis points and increasing our revenue-generating hires by 6%. Third, our enhanced earnings power disciplined portfolio management and strong free cash flow generation, up 13% in the quarter have strengthened our capital position. Through 3 quarters in 2025, we have reduce debt and remain on track to achieve our leverage objectives, closed $32 million in EBITDA from Middle acquisition, and returned $1.2 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our strong capital position empowers us to pursue high-return inorganic investments further accelerating and supplementing our organic growth momentum.\nCollectively, these 3 components: momentum on the growth drivers, accelerated scale benefits through ABS and a robust capital position are delivering growth today and setting the foundation for future performance. We continue to invest in capabilities and innovate capital solutions that create even greater value for our clients. And this gives us confidence not only in achieving our 2025 guidance but also in the upside potential of sustaining top line growth and delivering double-digit free cash flow beyond 2025.\nTurning to the quarter's results. Organic revenue growth was 7% and total revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $4 billion. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 170 basis points over last year and reached 26.3%. Adjusted EPS was $3.05, and finally, free cash flow increased 13%. Let's get into the details of these results, starting with organic revenue growth on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter, in line with our mid-single digit or greater guidance range. Growth was broad-based, 5% or better in each solution line with 2 of our solution lines delivering 7% or greater, a strong result achieved despite pricing pressure in certain products and geographies, underscoring the contribution from new business and continued high retention.\nIn commercial risk, 7% organic revenue growth reflected strong performance in our core P&C business globally, including double-digit growth in the U.S. with meaningful contribution from the middle market through NFP and continued strength in EMEA. M&A services continued to grow at a double-digit level, and this contribution provided an incremental lift. Construction also delivered double-digit growth. driven by demand from large-scale global infrastructure projects, including data center builds for major tech companies, reinforcing this category as a strategic priority.\nReinsurance delivered 8% growth driven by treaty placements and double-digit growth in facultative placements and the Strategy and Technology group. Insurance-linked securities also had significant growth, but off a smaller baseline. While July 1 treaty property renewal rates were softer, this was balanced by higher limits and ongoing strength in international facultative markets, especially in EMEA. Demand for STG analytics remain high, underscoring our platform's increasing importance in supporting clients as they navigate volatility and match capital to risk. Health Solutions grew 6% this quarter, befitting from data analytics-driven sales in our talent business and new business in our core health and benefits offerings across the U.S. and EMEA.\nAs Greg mentioned, we continue to leverage our analytics and advisory capabilities to support employers as they navigate rising health care costs and achieve better outcomes for their workforces. And finally, wealth generated 5% growth. The performance reflects strength in advisory work in the U.K. and EMEA related to ongoing regulatory change, partially offset by softer advisory demand in the U.S. Additionally, the NFP contribution was meaningful, driven by asset inflows and market performance.\nImportantly, for modeling purposes, I will add that we expect wealth growth in Q4 to be 1% to 2%, impacted by delays in U.S. advisory work and the sale of the faster-growing MFP Wealth business, which closed yesterday. Let me take a moment to walk through the key components of our Q3 organic revenue growth on Slide 7. In Q3, we extended our consistent track record of strong new business generation to drive organic growth. For the second consecutive quarter, new business contributed 11 points to organic revenue growth with balanced contributions from both expansion with existing clients and new client wins. Our investments in revenue-generating talent, particularly in high-growth sectors like construction and energy continue to deliver measurable impact. We remain proactive and on the front split in attracting top talent. Our revenue-generating hires are up 6% year-to-date.\nImportantly, we're already seeing these new colleagues make contributions to new business growth. As the 2024 hiring cohort continues to ramp, we are confident this group will contribute 30 to 35 basis points to full year organic revenue growth, leveraging advanced analytics and client engagement tools through Aon Business Services. The 11-point contribution from new business this quarter underscores the effectiveness of our investment in client-facing talent, and we expect continued momentum as the 2024 cohort seasons and the 2025 hires continue to on board. Q3 25 retention remained strong year-over-year, reflecting the continued strength and stability of our client relationships supported by investments in enhanced service delivery, innovative capabilities and Aon client leadership.\nNet new business contributed 5 points to organic revenue growth in the quarter. net market impact, which captures the impact of rate and exposure contributed just over 1 point to organic revenue growth, consistent with our 0 to 2-point estimated range. rate pressure on property within commercial risk was offset with limit and coverage increases across cyber and other financial lines. Reinsurance net market impact was flat as rate declines and higher retentions were mitigated by increased limits and facultative growth. Health Solutions continued to benefit from our ability to support clients managing rising health care costs, providing a significant contribution to net market impact.\nAnd one final point on revenue Third quarter fiduciary investment income was $75 million, down 12% versus the prior year. While average balances increase, lower interest rates more than offset that benefit. On Slide 8, adjusted operating income increased 15% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 26.3%. These results reflect strong top line growth and the operating leverage in our business, powered by ABS, giving us capacity to fund growth investments in client-facing talent and middle market while still expanding margins.\nWhen we provided full year guidance, we highlighted 4 components that would impact 2025 margin expansion. NFP, fiduciary investment income, restructuring and operating leverage, all 4 remain fully in line with our expectations. We have now fully lapped the headwind on margin from NFP, and we are on track to meet our $30 million OpEx synergies target, resulting in a net 20 basis point headwind from NFP for the year. while the outlook for U.S. interest rate cuts has shifted from 2 at the start of the year to 3 in the latest top plot, the delayed timing of the first rate cut from June to September effectively offsets the additional reduction in the margin impact from fiduciary investment income remains unchanged at 20 basis points.\nRestructuring savings totaled $35 million in the quarter contributing approximately 90 basis points to adjusted operating margin. We remain firmly on track to deliver $150 million in restructuring saves for the full year. and advancing toward our $350 million run rate savings target by 2026. With ABS driven scale improvements and strong execution year-to-date, we remain confident in delivering full year margin expansion of 80 to 90 basis points aligned with our long-term financial model. Moving to interest, other income and taxes on Slide 9. Interest income was negligible in the third quarter and $4 million lower than last year. Interest expense came in at $206 million, $7 million lower than last year, primarily due to lower average debt balances. We expect Q4 interest expense to be approximately $200 million. Other expense was $13 million versus a $33 million benefit in Q3 '24, which included gains from the divestment of [indiscernible] lines and real estate advisory assets partially offset by the remeasurement of balance sheet items in nonfunctional currencies.\nWe estimate Q4 '25 other expense to range between $25 million and $30 million. And finally, the Q3 tax rate was 19.2%. Our full year tax outlook remains unchanged at 19.5% to 20.5%. Turning now to free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 10. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. And year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.9 billion is up 13% year-over-year.\nAs we complete the NFP integration, we continue to expect strong adjusted operating income, including contributions from NFP and ongoing working capital improvements to drive double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025. And turning to capital on the right-hand side of the page. I noted earlier that we closed the sale of NFP Wealth. And with over $2 billion in proceeds, the transaction significantly strengthens our capital position and we approach the final months of the year in an even greater position of capital strength with enhanced flexibility.\nImportantly, we remain disciplined in allocating capital, balancing opportunities that meet our strategic and financial growth priorities with capital return to shareholders. This discipline reinforces our commitment to creating long-term shareholder value. And we continue to execute our capital allocation model in Q3 '25.\nWe reduced our leverage ratio to 3.2x in Q3, remaining on track to reach 2.8x 3.0x by the fourth quarter of 2025, consistent with our stated objective. We continued our programmatic tuck-in acquisitions, including middle market deals through MFP. Through 9 months, NFP has closed $32 million of EBITDA. And following the NFP wealth sale, we expect to close $35 million to $40 million in acquired EBITDA by year-end. The pipeline remains strong primarily composed of U.S. P&C opportunities. And finally, we returned $411 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $250 million in share repurchases. With $750 million repurchased year-to-date, we remain on track for $1 billion in capital return through share repurchases for full year 2025. I enabled by our high free cash flow generation.\nThese actions demonstrate our disciplined capital allocation, reducing leverage, investing in high-return growth opportunities in delivering meaningful capital return to shareholders. I will conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 11 with our 2025 guidance and some forward-looking perspective on our growth objectives.\nWe are reaffirming our full year 2025 guidance, including organic revenue growth, mid-single digit or greater capturing the impact of our growth investments. Second, margin expansion, 80 to 90 basis points, including $260 million in cumulative annual savings from our Aon United restructuring initiative. Next, strong earnings growth, supported by the scale improvements from ABS. I'll also note 2 additional points related to earnings. First, the sale of NFP Wealth is expected to have an immaterial impact on 2025 earnings growth. Second, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20.5% for the full year.\nFor modeling purposes, we are estimating 7% to 9% adjusted EPS growth in Q4 '25. Finally, free cash flow. Double-digit growth in 2025, demonstrating our ability to consistently convert our strong earnings into capital for investment and shareholder return. We entered the final stretch of the year with strong momentum, executing our 3x3 plan and financial model to deliver results today.\nAt the same time, scale improvements enabled by ABS, the cumulative impact of our growth investments and our capital capacity are strengthening the foundation for future performance, positioning us for sustainable top line growth and consistently strong earnings growth. This powerful combination gives us high conviction in our ability to create long-term value for shareholders. So with that, let's open the line for questions.\nDarryl, I'll turn it back to you."

Aon United, operationalized and accelerated by the 3x3 plan is driving meaningful performance demonstrated in our Q2 results, with continued momentum as we enter the second half of 2025, and look ahead to 2026.\nTo begin, we want to take a moment to reflect on the momentum coming out of our Investor Day, where we detailed why and how our client-centric Aon United strategy drive sustainable top line growth and exceptional free cash flow per share growth. Aon United, operationalized and accelerated by the 3x3 plan is driving meaningful performance demonstrated in our Q2 results, with continued momentum as we enter the second half of 2025, and look ahead to 2026.\nLet's start with some Q2 highlights. We delivered a strong quarter, in line with our expectations, including 6% organic revenue growth, 19% adjusted EPS growth, and 59% free cash flow growth. For clients, facing an increasingly complex operating environment, our work to deliver for them has never been more essential, and we remain confident in our ability to meet their evolving needs, both now and over the long term.\nLet's start with some Q2 highlights.

For clients, facing an increasingly complex operating environment, our work to deliver for them has never been more essential, and we remain confident in our ability to meet their evolving needs, both now and over the long term.\nAt Investor Day, we discussed how market reality shaping the current operating landscape are complex and constantly evolving. Clients of all sizes, industries and geographies are challenged with how to address and respond to the interconnected megatrends of trade, technology, weather and workforce. And the pressure is only growing. In the weeks following Investor Day alone, we've seen several major developments but demonstrate the impact and connectivity of these megatrends.\nAt Investor Day, we discussed how market reality shaping the current operating landscape are complex and constantly evolving.

And the pressure is only growing. In the weeks following Investor Day alone, we've seen several major developments but demonstrate the impact and connectivity of these megatrends.\nThe enactment of U.S. tax legislation and continued shifts in the global tariff landscape. Severe flooding in convective storms across the U.S., alongside record-breaking heat waves in both the U.S. and Europe. Events that have given historic first half catastrophe losses, disrupted supply chains, displaced workforces and caused widespread property damage. And significant workforce changes announced by some of the world's largest technology companies, citing the accelerated impact of AI on roles and responsibilities. These events, and many others, reinforce the importance of our Aon United strategy as we help clients make better decisions, and achieve better outcomes, in what is arguably the most complex operating environment they've ever faced.\nThe enactment of U.S. tax legislation and continued shifts in the global tariff landscape.

And as a result, we reaffirm our 2025 full year guidance, and our commitment to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth over the '23 to '26 3x3 plan period.\nIt's clear our Aon United strategy, powered by ABS continues to drive innovation, deliver actionable insights and match client risk with new sources of capital.

Edmund, over to you.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here to discuss our second quarter results, which reflect both execution and the growing momentum of our 3x3 plan. And before we get into the details of our second quarter results, I want to take a moment to elevate what matters most.\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here to discuss our second quarter results, which reflect both execution and the growing momentum of our 3x3 plan. And before we get into the details of our second quarter results, I want to take a moment to elevate what matters most.\nThere are three key proof points that best capture the momentum behind our strategy and the strength of our performance. These highlights provide the right context for the details that follow and underscore how our execution on the 3x3 plan is translating into tangible results.\nThere are three key proof points that best capture the momentum behind our strategy and the strength of our performance. These highlights provide the right context for the details that follow and underscore how our execution on the 3x3 plan is translating into tangible results.\nFirst, we see clear evidence that our financial model is delivering is designed. Our investments in revenue-generating hires equipped with the analytical tools and client experience enhancements enabled by Aon Business Services, or ABS, are translating into sustainable mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth was 6% for the quarter and we are winning new business, expanding our relationships with existing clients and doing so with greater client engagement.\nSecond, these Q2 results are not just about top line performance. They reflect our ability to invest in growth and expand margins, not through cost cutting, but through operating leverage. The scale improvements powered by ABS, along with our restructuring program savings, created capacity to fund growth investments while still expanding margins by 80 basis points over last year, in line with our long-term model.\nThird, the top line strength, coupled with the operating leverage drove 19% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year, and we converted those earnings into 59% free cash flow growth in the quarter, a clear demonstration of the strength of our earnings power and capital position. This performance reinforces our conviction in delivering double-digit free cash flow growth, for the full year, and it gives us the flexibility to execute across all dimensions of our capital allocation strategy. We remain on track to meet our leverage objective, continue our disciplined middle-market M&A strategy, and returned $1 billion in capital to shareholders via share repurchases this year.\nTaken together, our first half performance, 5% organic revenue growth and 8% adjusted EPS growth, reflects the strength and resilience of our business and financial model and the discipline of our execution. In the macro environment that remains uncertain, we are delivering results by deepening client relationships and creating more value for clients through data insights and innovative capital solutions. We are driving growth through our investments and data capabilities, expanding margins through ABS, and converting earnings into strong free cash flow. This gives us confidence in achieving our full year 2025 guidance.\nSo now turning to the second quarter results in the financial summary on Slide 5. You see that we delivered 6% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, and total revenue increased 11% to $4.2 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 28.2%, up 80 basis points for the quarter, in line with our expectations. And this includes the impact from NFP, as we lap the anniversary of the acquisition at the end of April, resulting in a more normalized margin profile going forward. Adjusted EPS was $3.49. And finally, free cash flow increased to $732 million, reflecting strong adjusted operating income growth and continued improvement in days sales outstanding.\nLet's get into the details of these results, starting with organic revenue growth on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in Q2 '25 was in line with our mid-single digit or greater guidance range. Growth was broad-based with 3 of our 4 solution lines, Commercial Risk, Reinsurance and Health, each delivering 6% organic revenue growth, reflecting strong new business performance and high retention.\nIn Commercial Risk, the 6% organic revenue growth in Q2 reflected strong performance in our core P&C business with meaningful contributions from both North America and EMEA, as well as strength in M&A services relative to prior year, and double-digit growth in construction. Notably, construction and renewable energy projects remain key areas of focus for us with activity levels continuing to be robust.\nIn Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 6%, driven by double-digit growth in our insurance-linked securities business, where we continue to lead the market in cat bond placements, now totaling $50 billion outstanding. We saw double-digit growth in facultative placements in EMEA and Asia Pacific, which helped offset softer April 1 property renewals where rates declined 5% to 20%. Looking ahead, we continue to expect full year organic revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit or greater objective. Supported by higher limits at July 1 renewals, continued momentum in international facultative placements and strong demand for analytics from our strategy and technology group.\nHealth Solutions also delivered 6% growth in the quarter and benefited from continued strength in our core Health and Benefits business, especially across international markets. Growth was fueled by net new business and market dynamics that continue to drive rising health care costs. We also saw a strong contribution from NFP, most notably in executive benefits and pharmacy solutions, where demand remains elevated.\nAnd finally, Wealth generated 3% organic revenue growth on top of 9% growth in the prior year period. The performance this quarter was driven by regulatory work across the U.K. and EMEA. We also saw a meaningful contribution from NFP asset inflows and market performance.\nSo let me take a moment now to walk through the components of our Q2 organic revenue growth on Slide 7. As I shared at Investor Day, Aon has a consistent track record of generating new business, and that continued in Q2. In the quarter, new business powered organic revenue growth and contributed 11 points, with an equal contribution from both new clients and expansion with existing clients. Our investments in revenue-generating talent, in high-growth areas like construction and energy are delivering measurable impact.\nRevenue-generating head count is up 6% through the first half, and these colleagues are equipped with advanced data analytics and capabilities from ABS, enabling them to win more business. We continue to expect these investments to support sustainable organic revenue growth, with the 2024 cohort projected to contribute 30 to 35 basis points to full year organic revenue growth.\nQ2 '25 retention improved by 1 point year-over-year, driven by continued gains in commercial risk, as we expand enterprise client leader coverage and deploy our Risk Capital Analyzer. Net new business contributed 5 points to organic revenue growth in the quarter. Net market impact, which captures the impact of rate and exposure, contributed approximately 1 point to organic revenue growth, consistent with our 0 to 2-point estimated range. Reinsurance was down from rate declines and higher retentions, and rate pressure in Commercial Risk was offset with limit and coverage increases across our book. Health and Wealth both benefited from positive net market impact with rising health care costs and favorable asset performance supporting growth.\nAnd one final point on revenue. Second quarter fiduciary investment income was $66 million in the quarter, down 12% versus the prior year, while average balances increased lower interest rates more than offset that benefit.\nOn Slide 8, adjusted operating income was up 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 28.2%. This margin expansion reflects the impact of the four components that we highlighted when we provided full year guidance. NFP, fiduciary investment income, restructuring and operating leverage, all of which are in line with our expectations.\nWhile we absorbed a 1-month margin headwind from NFP given the April 2024 closing, our margin continued to benefit from the scale improvement driven by ABS and the savings from our restructuring program. Specifically, restructuring savings totaled $35 million in the quarter, contributing approximately 83 basis points to adjusted operating margin. We remain on track to deliver $150 million in restructuring savings for the full year, and are progressing well toward our goal of $350 million in run rate savings by 2026. Given our strong progress in the first half of the year, we remain confident and our ability to drive full year adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 to 90 basis points, consistent with our long-term model.\nMoving to interest, other income and taxes on Slide 9. As we indicated last quarter, interest income was negligible in the second quarter, and $31 million lower than last year when we earned interest on funds held ahead of the NFP acquisition. Interest expense of $212 million was lower by $13 million versus the prior year, primarily due to lower average debt balances. We expect interest expense to be approximately $210 million in Q3 '25.\nOther expense rose by $17 million year-over-year to $32 million, primarily due to the remeasurement of balance sheet items in nonfunctional currencies and higher noncash pension expense. We estimate Q3 '25 other expense to range between $25 million and $32 million. And finally, the Q2 tax rate was 16.5%, reflecting a favorable impact related to discrete items. While we expect variability in the quarterly rate, our year-to-date rate of 19.3% is in line with our expectations, and our full year tax outlook remains unchanged at 19.5% to 20.5%.\nTurning now to free cash flow on Slide 10. We generated $732 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, up 59% year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is up 13%, and this growth reflects strong adjusted operating income, including contributions from NFP, and continued improvements in days sales outstanding. This free cash flow performance gives us the flexibility to execute across all dimensions of our capital allocation strategy, and we continue to expect double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025.\nTurning to capital allocation. On the right side of the page, we remain focused on executing our disciplined and balanced capital allocation. We continue to make progress on deleveraging, lowering our leverage ratio to 3.4x in the second quarter. We remain on track to achieve our target range of 2.8x to 3.0x by the fourth quarter of 2025, consistent with the objective we set when we announced the NFP acquisition.\nWe also remained active in M&A, continuing our targeted tuck-in acquisitions across priority areas, including middle market deals to NFP. Through June, NFP closed 8 acquisitions representing $20 million of EBITDA, with 80% of the EBITDA connected to P&C deals. Finally, we returned $411 million in capital to shareholders this quarter, due to dividend, and $250 million in share repurchases, keeping us on track for $1 billion in capital return through share repurchases for the full year. Each of these actions underpinned by strong free cash flow generation reflects our disciplined capital allocation model in action. Reducing leverage, investing in high-return growth and returning capital to shareholders.\nSo I'll conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 11 with some thoughts on our financial objectives and 2025 guidance. Our second quarter results, and our performance through the first half of 2025, reflect the strength of our financial model and our execution on our 3x3 plan. We are delivering sustainable organic revenue growth by investing in the capabilities that fuel growth. Client-facing talent, differentiated analytics, and seamless client experience through ABS.\nOur organic revenue growth, combined with the initiatives we are executing across ABS to standardize operations and integrate platforms is creating capacity to fund our growth investments, while strengthening the foundation for ongoing margin expansion. This combination is enhancing our earnings power and positioning us to deliver on our full year commitments and long-term financial objectives. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance, including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, 80 to 90 basis points of margin expansion, including $260 million in cumulative annual savings from our Aon United restructuring initiative, strong earnings growth, and double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025, and a double-digit 3-year CAGR for 2023 to 2026. We are executing with focus. We have momentum, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nSo with that, let's jump into your questions. Donna, back to you."

Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2025 Conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case. CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Edmund Reese, our CFO. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website, which Edmund will reference in his remarks.\nWe want to start by acknowledging our colleague and friend, Eric Andersen. We announced last month that Eric transitioned from his role as President to serve as a senior adviser, and in his 28 years with Aon, Eric played a significant role in advancing our Aon United strategy, and he's been a leader helping execute our 3x3 plan to deliver more value to our clients and positioning Aon for continued growth. Thank you, Eric, for your leadership and friendship.\nTurning to our financial performance. We continue to build momentum in year 2 of our 3x3 plan and our execution is translating into results that are fully in line with our financial objectives. Our team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit growth, with organic revenue growth of 5%. With this organic growth and the addition of NFP, we delivered 16% total revenue growth, a 38.4% margin contributed to 12% adjusted operating income growth and adjusted EPS of 5.67%. And finally, we generated $80 million in free cash flow and returned $397 million in capital to shareholders. Notably, we also announced that we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 10%, the 15th consecutive year of dividend growth.\nThe quarter's strong operating performance marks the start to 2025 on track and right in line with our expectations. Importantly, we achieved these results in an unpredictable and turbulent business environment that is creating greater complexity for our clients. Within the four mega-trends that we reference, trade, technology, weather and workforce. Trade is currently and clearly top of mind. Today, [indiscernible] have had limited direct impact on our business and financial results. Over the medium term, where there could be impact to client discretionary spending, we believe the demand benefit is also meaningful given the trust we've established with our clients, positioning us to support and help them adapt to new trade rules and to mitigate risk and capture new opportunities.\nBut for many clients, tariffs have challenged the global landscape, posing a significant risk. And against this challenge, we are arming clients with real-time [indiscernible] they need to make better decisions. A few examples include using our supply chain Risk Diagnostic Tool to advise clients on effectively diversifying or reconfiguring their supply chain operations. We're tailoring Credit Solutions like political risk insurance, surety bonds and trade credit insurance and advising on human capital issues like restructuring employee stock ramps. Further, our expertise in ABS capabilities are helping clients fortify their operations to maintain stability despite trade disruptions.\nUltimately, our unique and connected capability and the increased complexity of the global trade environment is driving demand for Aon's Advice and Solutions. On our Q4 call, we highlighted that on the back of strong performance in year 1 of our 3x3 plan, we were entering 2025 with great momentum, and we've continued to execute in the first quarter. Using ABS capabilities to expand with and better serve clients, attracting client-facing talent in priority areas and utilizing exceptional NFP capability to accelerate middle market growth, which today reached the 1-year anniversary as part of Aon.\nAnd specifically on NFP, we couldn't be more thrilled to have NFP as part of the Aon family. As we reflect on this year 1 milestone, we highlight that the business continues to perform in line with high expectations. Our progress guided by the principle of independent and committed is right on track. Producer retention continues to be higher than pre-deal, and the NFP acquisition engine continues to add high-quality middle market EBITDA through targeted acquisitions with a strong pipeline for the remainder of 2025. This quarter is a testament to the power of the combined NFP and Aon, as we absorbed the peak impact of an increased share count from the transaction.\nWith the acquisition now annualized, we expect NFP's contribution to become even more meaningful as we progress through 2025. Further, on the important people front, we made significant progress on our talent investment by hiring in priority areas like construction and surety. Colleagues are choosing Aon because they see the power of our capability and connected firm enabled by ABS to win new clients and better serve existing clients. Finally, to connect all the dots with one specific client example. We expanded our relationship with a major Risk Capital client, who is facing soring healthcare costs due to high-cost climates. We won their human capital mandate using our Health Risk Analyzer to provide insights and predictive analytics on the [indiscernible] future claims, helping them manage both their risk and benefits budget. This example highlights the strength of our 3x3 plan to drive financial results.\nAs we look ahead, while it's clear we're operating in a complex economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience and strength of our business and financial model. We have a track record of sustained performance across bull markets, recessions, economic shocks and changing political landscape. And in fact, our integrated solutions, Aon United strategy bring differentiated and substantial client benefit in periods of greatest uncertainty. We view the current environment as an opportunity to further strengthen our client relationships and reinforce Aon as a trusted adviser. In our daily interactions with clients, we have not seen a pullback in demand, rather, we see an increase in clients looking for guidance and offerings to navigate the increasing complexity of their business challenges. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2025 full year guidance, including mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion, strong earnings growth and double-digit free cash flow growth.\nTo summarize, we want to reiterate our conviction about the opportunity ahead, that Aon Advice and Solutions are even more valuable to clients as they navigate increased complexity in their business. We continue to see momentum across our business, from the high-quality talent we're attracted to Aon to the progress we're making to attack the $31 billion middle market opportunity to major wins with both new and existing clients, and we remain on track to deliver against our 2025 financial goals. Of course, none of this would be possible without our global team. We want to thank our 60,000 colleagues around the world for their commitment to excellence and innovation, your extraordinary leadership and hard work is what enables us to deliver for our clients.\nAnd finally, and to focus further on our long-term strategy and opportunity, we hope you can join us through our Investor Day on June 9. Edmund and I and the senior executives leading our 3x3 plan look forward to sharing details about Aon United as a powerful asset, and how we'll continue to drive sustainable long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. We promise this to be a very productive event. Now I'll turn the call to Edmund for a more detailed review of our financials and outlook. Edmund?\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here discussing the results for the first quarter of 2025. [ Without ] jumping into the details, it's important to filter the quarterly noise both within first quarter results and within the uncertainty of the broader macroeconomic environment and emphasize the signals from Q1 that reinforce our confidence in the fundamentals of our business and financial model, supporting our full 2025 guidance and ongoing long-term growth.\nFirst, our Q1 performance underscores our commitment to making the investments that support sustainable mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, investing in hiring client-facing talent, strengthening and accelerating our ABS capabilities, and increasing our Aon client leaders to expand with our existing clients. Organic revenue growth reached 5% of the quarter with retention tracking 1 point better than Q1 '24 and market impact from pricing and exposures, reflecting some pressure but slightly better than our expectations and still within our estimated range.\nSecond, relentless execution on our accelerating Aon United Restructuring Program, notably in ABS, is facing 85 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, creating capacity to fund the investments that I just referenced and strengthening the foundation for ongoing operating leverage from scale benefits. Third, we continued our balanced capital allocation discipline, remaining on track to meet our leverage objective while simultaneously continuing our middle market tuck-in acquisition to drive growth and returning $397 million in capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.\nAdditionally, our continued focus on portfolio management positions us to further strengthen our capital position, double down on growth in our core business, and sustain healthy capital returns to shareholders. So the drivers of full year 2025 growth, investing for sustainable organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion and our strong capital position remains stable, and we are executing our plan. Despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the noise in the first quarter, specifically from FX given the dollars, 3% to 7% stronger than it was in Q1 '24, where we have currency exposure, [indiscernible] of additional impact on margin from NFP higher interest in shares driven by the acquisition of NFP, all items that we communicated as part of our 2025 guidance.\nWe have a high level of confidence in delivering on our financial objectives and achieving full year results in line with our 2025 guidance. So now turning to the first quarter results and the financial summary on Slide 6. You see that total revenue increased 16% to $4.7 billion, and we delivered 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income margin was 38.4%, down 130 basis points as we recognize the impact of NFP in the Q1 '25 results. Adjusted EPS was $5.67, reflecting the impact of higher interest and shares. And finally, we generated $84 million in free cash flow. So let's get into the details of these results, starting with organic revenue growth on Slide 8.\nOrganic revenue growth reached 5% in Q1 2025, continuing to be in line with our mid-single digit or greater guidance range. In Commercial Risk, organic revenue growth was 5%, with the biggest contribution coming from our international P&C business. Additionally, the growth reflected continued strength in our North American core P&C business. And while deal activity was slower than expected when entering the year, we had a modest tailwind from M&A services relative to Q1 '24. Reinsurance with 4% organic revenue growth was driven by growth in treaty placements and double-digit growth in both facultative placements and insurance-linked securities. This growth was partially offset by the impact of a multiyear extension with a significant client at higher limits and adjusted commission.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect softer market conditions with April 1 property rates in both the U.S. and Japan down 5% to 20%. Importantly, we expect full year organic revenue growth in line with our mid-single digit or greater objective as we see a strong second half driven by higher limits at July 1 renewals, continued growth in our international facultative placements and strength in our strategy and technology group. Health Solutions also delivered 5% growth, driven by a double-digit increase in our core Health and Benefits business, which was particularly strong in our international markets. The growth was fueled by net new business and market conditions that continue to simulate rising health care costs.\nIn talent, we saw high single-digit growth in our Advisory business, offset by lower Data Analytics sales which were impacted by our data delivery schedule. We still expect our talent business to deliver mid-single digit or greater full year growth. And finally, Wealth was our highest growing solution line in the quarter, generating 8% organic revenue growth, primarily driven by NFP asset inflows and market performance, and continued regulatory work across the U.K. and EMEA. I will note that in the second quarter, we will be growing over and elevated Q2 2024.\nOur Q1 organic revenue growth continued to be powered by new business, which contributed 9 points from both existing and new clients. [indiscernible] was 1 point better than the year ago, with Commercial Risk steadily improving as we deploy our Risk Capital Analyzers, supporting a net new business contribution of 4 points to organic revenue growth. The net market impact, which measures the impact of exposures and rate contributed 1 point to organic revenue growth, squarely within our 0 to 2-point estimated range. Reinsurance was flat as rate declines were mitigated with increased sideways coverage, and rate pressure and commercial risk was offset with limit in coverage increases across our book. Health and Wealth had positive net market impact as we continue to see increasing cost in Health and positive market impact in Wealth.\nAnd one final point on revenue first quarter fiduciary investment income was down 15% versus last year to $67 million as the increased average balances was more than offset by lower interest rates. And as a reminder, we do not include fiduciary investment income in our organic revenue growth calculation. On Slide 9, adjusted operating income was up 12% for the quarter to $1.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 38.4% in the first quarter, in line with expectations and down from 39.7% in Q1 '24 reflecting the impact of the NFP acquisition, which closed in late April 2024 as well as the interest rate impact on investment income from fiduciary balances. Adjusted operating margin continued to benefit from the scale in our business, particularly through Aon Business Services and from a restructuring initiative to accelerate our 3x3 plans.\nSpecifically, restructuring savings in the first quarter were $40 million, which contributed approximately 85 basis points to adjusted operating margin. Looking ahead, we continue to expect $150 million of savings for the full year 2025 and are well on track to achieve our stated goal of $350 million of run rate savings in 2026. Our organic revenue growth and the actions we are taking through Aon Business Services to standardize our operations and integrate our platforms or creating capacity to fund our growth investments, and setting the foundation for ongoing margin expansion through operating efficiencies and scale in our business. We remain committed to driving full year adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 to 90 basis points in 2025.\nMoving to interest, other income and taxes on Slide 10. Interest income of $5 million was $23 million lower than last year when we earned interest on funds utilized in the NFP acquisition. We expect interest income to be negligible in Q2 '25 compared to the $31 million in Q2 '24. Interest expense of $206 million was up $62 million versus last year, reflecting $7 billion in higher debt driven by the NFP acquisition. We expect $209 million of interest expense in Q2 '25. Other expense increased $23 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher noncash pension expense. And finally, the Q1 tax rate was 20.9%, 160 basis points lower than Q1 '24, reflecting the geographic mix of income growth and the favorable impact of discrete items.\nOur tax guidance for the full year remains at 19.5% to 20.5%. Turning now to free cash flow, and capital allocation on Slide 11.\nWe generated $84 million of free cash flow in Q1, reflecting strong operating income growth and DSO improvements, partially offset by higher incentive interest and restructuring payments. We continue to expect double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025 and a double-digit 3-year CAGR on free cash flow from 2023 to 2026. In the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.5x, and we continue to be on track to achieve a 2.8x to 3x leverage ratio in Q4 2025, consistent with the objective that we set when we announced the NFP acquisition. Additionally, we remained active in M&A, continuing our targeted tuck-in acquisitions across priority areas, including middle market acquisitions through NFP which acquired $19 million in EBITDA in Q1. The pipeline remains strong, especially with opportunities in commercial risk, and we continue to expect to acquire $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA to NFP middle market acquisitions in 2025.\nFinally, we returned $397 million in capital to shareholders due to dividend and $250 million in share repurchases in Q1. Additionally, and as Greg mentioned, in April, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.74 per share, marking 15th consecutive annual dividend increases reflecting the strength of our business and financial model and our confidence in achieving double-digit free cash flow growth. I will conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 12 with our 2025 guidance and some final thoughts.\nThe first quarter 2025 performance signals a start to the year that is right in line with our expectations. We are executing our 3x3 plan and have momentum that is being reflected in our first quarter results. We're moving the noise and elevating what matters for our full year 2025 guidance let me highlight the following; We achieved 5% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, meeting our objectives. So we are reaffirming our mid-single-digit or greater 2025 full year guidance for organic revenue growth. We continue to get scale benefits through ABS. We are achieving our restructuring goals and we continue to actively manage the portfolio, so we are still expecting and reaffirming 80 to 90 basis points of margin expansion for the full year 2025. We also continue to expect strong earnings growth for the full year. And I will note that we are excited that today marks the 1-year anniversary of the NFP acquisition.\nAnd as a reminder, the late April '24 close will impact Q2 '25 margin and earnings just as we expected. For modeling purposes, we are estimating 15% to 18% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 '25. And finally, our earnings growth, including NFP, will contribute to double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025 and a double-digit 3-year CAGR for '23 to '26. Our guidance demonstrates the strength and resiliency of our business and financial model. We are prioritizing investments that support sustainable organic revenue growth. Our execution in Aon Business Services is supporting top line growth, creating investment capacity and delivering margin expansion. We expect to deliver strong earnings per share growth and to generate double-digit free cash flow growth, and we continue to have disciplined capital allocation, balancing between high-return growth investment in capital return to shareholders.\nFinally, as Greg mentioned, my 60,000-plus colleagues and I are excited to host an Investor Day on June 9, our first in 20 years. and I look forward to your participation. So with that, Rob, we get back to you and we'll jump into questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year conference call. I'm joined by Edmund Reese, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website, which Edmund will reference in his remarks.\nWe want to begin by sending our deepest sympathy to our colleagues, clients and all those impacted by recent disasters and in particular, the devastating wildfires in Southern California. The destruction and loss of life are tragic events. And all of us at Aon are committed to supporting our clients, colleagues and partners during the response and recovery.\nNow turning to Aon. We're excited to be here this morning to discuss our strong performance in 2024. We had great execution in year 1 of our 3x3 Plan with all credit to our colleagues around the globe, which I will cover in more detail at the close of my comments. That execution is translating into winning more clients, expanding our relationships and keeping clients longer through improved retention. And it shows in our financial results.\nFor the full year 2024, we grew organic revenue 6%, total revenue 17%. We delivered strong margins and grew our operating income by 17%, driving 10% adjusted earnings per share growth and continued strong free cash flow. These results are a strong start to our 3x3 Plan.\nAnd as we go into 2025, year 2, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion in line with our historic performance, strong adjusted EPS growth, double-digit free cash flow growth and disciplined capital allocation.\nAs we move forward, it's important to understand the environment in which our clients are operating and the external factors shaping client demand. Every day, our clients tells that increasing volatility and complexity make decisions regarding risk and people issues more difficult.\nThe challenges businesses face reflect a series of profound transitions across the megatrends of trade, technology, weather and workforce, which we saw reinforced by events throughout 2024 and which are firmly in place as we move into 2025. These 4 megatrends are causing significant challenges across every sector and every type of business.\nAt the same time, leaders worried that their organizations aren't moving quickly enough to address these risks. Our 3x3 Plan is anchored in meeting these intensifying client requirements, better serving our clients with unique content, servicing capability and expertise needed to respond to these challenges.\nIn this environment, for Aon, 2024 was a year of tremendous progress across all 3 pillars of our 3x3 Plan: Risk Capital and Human Capital, Aon client leadership and Aon Business Services, 3 commitments we're delivering over a 3-year period.\nFirst, we committed to levering our distinctive Risk Capital and Human Capital structure to unlock new solutions that address the evolving client demand discussed earlier. In 2024, we created and delivered innovative solutions that integrate reinsurance and commercial risk data and analytics. Solutions using this connected capability are enabling clients to access capital more efficiently and make better decisions.\nOur work in the fourth quarter to help source $715 million of alternative reinsurance capacity for a major underwriter and the record 30% increase in Aon client treated capacity are just 2 examples of the power of Risk Capital. Similarly, in Human Capital, a global company with over 100,000 employees in more than 100 countries ordered us the mandate for their global benefits program. Our global team brought together regional data and insights from analytic tools to deliver a comprehensive, globally consistent and compliant benefits offering.\nWhat was originally just a small Aon relationship in one jurisdiction is now an international relationship across every region they operate to support their colleagues in enterprise strategy. And this is just one example that demonstrates unique value of our globally connected firm and differentiated data-driven advice and solutions.\nFor Risk Capital, we also want to note and officially welcome John Neal to Aon. We announced earlier this month that John will join us from Lloyd's as our Global CEO of Reinsurance and Global Chairman of Climate Solutions upon the completion of his commitments to Lloyd's. Not only will John's arrival bring an iconic industry leader to help focus on delivering our integrated Risk Capital capabilities to clients, but his addition also represents another strong testament to the power of our Risk Capital and Human Capital strategy.\nOur second commitment is to embed the Aon client leadership model across our enterprise client, large and middle market segments to strengthen and expand client relationships. In 2024, we capitalized on our globally connected approach covering nearly 1,000 of our most critically important global clients within our enterprise client group. These clients grew new business 5 points above the Aon average in 2024 as we increase penetration across solution lines and geographies.\nThird, we committed to and are accelerating Aon Business Services to establish a new standard for service delivery and innovation at scale. And we made progress and great strides in 2024, giving clients real-time insights to help them make better decisions. From advanced analytics to customized dashboards, the tools that we launched this year are redefining client experiences and outcomes.\nIn May, we debuted a new suite of risk analyzer tools, enabling our North American clients to receive exposure data, quantify loss potential and make better decisions based on total cost of risk. And we've seen great early traction with our analyzers, which continue to open doors, broad discussions with our clients and increase win rates.\nLet me highlight just a few of many examples. Early in 2024, we released our property risk analyzer. Through exposure profiles and data models, the tool stimulates the impact of insurance policy options to determine which risk should be retained versus transferred.\nIn the fourth quarter, we launched the cyber risk analyzer, enabling risk managers and brokers to better evaluate cyber risk and maximize insurance value. We also launched our health risk analyzer, a solution that leverages predictive modeling, risk optimization and ongoing monitoring to help clients identify and manage costs and plan for a predictable risk [indiscernible].\nAt the same time, ABS retired nearly 300 applications and continues to drive greater efficiencies, which are foundational to our sustained margin expansion, which Edmund will describe. The result of meeting these milestones in 2024 is the delivery of highly distinctive capabilities and expertise that has created sustainable momentum for Aon.\nWe also want to highlight the progress we're making with NFP. Eight months in, the business is performing very well, just as expected. Integration is right on track. Producer retention is strong, and the acquisition is driving top line growth as we build on NFP's strong client relationships by bringing additional content capabilities and tools to the team. Clients have responded well to the potential for NFP under the Aon umbrella, giving us even more confidence in our ability to achieve our sales and cost synergy goals in 2025 and 2026.\nAnd against this operating backdrop, Aon closed the year with a strong fourth quarter that drove another year of financial performance aligned with our objectives. As we begin year 2 of the 3x3 Plan, we entered 2025 with momentum and have a strong foundation to build upon. The progress achieved in 2024 demonstrated the potential of our strategy, and now we will advance each component to drive further success.\nLooking ahead, as we onboard recent hires, we're continuing to invest to support top line growth, particularly client-facing talent in prioritized growth areas and an innovative new technology-driven solutions enabled through Aon Business Services.\nIn addition, the efficiencies we gain through Aon Business Services continue to support margin expansion. As a result, we expect to deliver another year of mid-single-digit or greater organic growth, continued margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and double-digit free cash flow growth for 2025.\nTo summarize and before I hand the call to Edmund for a more detailed review of our financials and outlook, we want to reinforce how excited our leadership team is for the opportunity ahead. We're executing against our strategy through the 3x3 Plan.\nOur solutions are helping clients as they face increasing volatility and complexity in their businesses. We're delivering results, including mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth in line with our long-term financial model in 2024. NFP is right on track. And finally, the significant progress we made in 2024 positions Aon for another strong year in 2025 to deliver on our client, colleague and financial objectives.\nOf course, none of this would be possible without Aon's global team. And on behalf of Edmund, Eric and me, I will conclude my comments by first, reinforcing our foundational commitment to our team to ensure that Aon fosters a culture and work environment strengthened by the power of inclusion, built to attract, develop and retain the best talent in the world from all backgrounds.\nAnd second, just shout out a huge thank you to our 60,000 colleagues around the world for serving our clients with distinction and for making 2024 a tremendous year.\nLet me now turn to Edmund to walk through the financials and provide additional insight around our expectations for 2025. Edmund?\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here discussing the results from yet another strong quarter that caps strong full year 2024 performance and positions us to achieve our 2024 to 2026 3x3 Plan financial objectives.\nBefore jumping into these results and providing 2025 guidance, I want to take a moment to highlight some critical milestones achieved in 2024 that demonstrate the strong progress that we've made toward our commitments. First, our full year performance is right in line with our objectives and guidance from mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow.\nIn particular, organic revenue growth reached 6% for the year, giving us confidence in our 3x3 Plan and our investments in hiring client-facing talent, developing client-facing ABS capabilities and expanding our enterprise client group will support mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth.\nSecond, we completed the acquisition of NFP, which expanded our presence in the $31 billion and fast-growing middle market. In 2024, we saw strong producer retention better than 2023, accretive top line financial results and $36 million in middle-market acquired EBITDA with a robust Q1 '25 pipeline, all in line with our expectations.\nThird, we paid down $2.1 billion in debt and returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders due to dividend and share repurchases, lowering our leverage in line with our objectives and continuing our balanced capital allocation discipline.\nWe are executing our plan. And these milestones emphasize that with year 1 of our 3x3 Plan complete, we have momentum. And continued execution gives us a high level of confidence in delivering on our 3x3 financial objectives, including a double-digit 3-year CAGR in free cash flow from 2023 to 2026.\nYou can see from the financial summary on Slide 6 that full year total revenue increased 17% to $16 billion, and we delivered 6% organic revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 17%. And adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, up 90 basis points relative to a '23 baseline that includes NFP. Adjusted EPS was up 10% to $15.60. And finally, we generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow, reflecting strong adjusted operating income growth and continued working capital improvements.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth was also 6%, marking a third consecutive quarter of growth at 6% or greater. Adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, expanding 140 basis points relative to a '23 baseline that includes NFP, and adjusted EPS was up 14% to $4.42.\nLet's get into the details of these results, starting with organic revenue growth on Slide 8. In Q4, organic revenue growth of 6% was right on track and in line with our mid-single digit or greater guidance range.\nIn commercial risk, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q4 and was broad-based, reflecting strength in our North American core P&C business, continued strong contribution from our international businesses and an uptick in construction as we're beginning to see the impact from specialty hires. We also benefited from double-digit growth in M&A services as increased transaction activity continued to be a modest tailwind.\nReinsurance organic revenue reached 6% in Q4 '24, growing over an elevated Q4 '23 on the back of continued strength in our strategy and technology group, strong treaty placements with existing clients and increased insurance-linked securities. Specifically, interest in catastrophe bonds continue to grow as investors seek unique asset classes with uncorrelated returns, and Aon is the leading industry provider in cat bond placements.\nHealth Solutions grew 5% in Q4 '24, also against a high Q4 '23 comparable. Growth in core health and benefits as well as NFP executive benefits and pharmacy benefits was partially offset by lower revenue in talent solutions.\nFinally, Wealth Solutions delivered 8% organic revenue growth in Q4 driven by continued strong demand for pension risk transfer consulting, regulatory work from policy changes across the U.K. and EMEA and new clients' market performance in NFP.\nOur Q4 organic revenue growth was powered by new business, which contributed 12 points from both existing and new clients as well as a modest contribution from M&A services as I mentioned earlier. And with continued high retention in the mid-90s, supported by the increasing deployment of our ABS capabilities, as Greg mentioned, net new business drove the 6 points of organic revenue growth. The net market impact from growth and exposures in rates was flat.\nReinsurance did have a modestly negative rate impact in the fourth quarter, consistent with early views of 1/1 renewals as capital capacity, up 7% for the year, outstripped demand. We saw the lower rates in reinsurance offset with modest rate benefit across commercial, health and wealth.\nFor the full year, each of the solution lines across Risk Capital and Human Capital were well within or above our mid-single-digit or greater growth objective with commercial risk at 5% and all other solution lines growing at or above 6%. And I'll add that if measured separately, NFP and Aon are both generating mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.\nTurning now on to margins on Slide 10. Adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 33.3%, expanding 140 basis points from our combined baseline with NFP. On a full year basis, adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, and we delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion relative to our combined baseline with NFP.\nWe continue to drive adjusted operating margin expansion due to scale in our business, particularly through Aon Business Services, our continued portfolio management and the shift in mix to higher-margin businesses as well as ongoing expense discipline and importantly, the benefit from our restructuring initiatives to accelerate our 3x3 Plan.\nWe ended the year $10 million ahead of our restructuring plan objective. And savings in the fourth quarter were $40 million, resulting in a $110 million of savings for full year '24. Restructuring savings contributed approximately 100 basis points in Q4 and approximately 70 basis points to full year margin expansion.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect an incremental $150 million of savings in 2025 and are well on track to achieve our stated objective of $350 million of run rate savings in 2026. Our strong organic growth and the actions that we are taking through ABS to standardize our operations and integrate our platforms are setting the foundation for ongoing margin expansion through operating leverage in our business.\nMoving to interest, other income and taxes on Slide 11. Interest expense of $206 million in the quarter was up $82 million versus last year primarily reflecting the issuance of $7 billion in debt to fund the NFP acquisition. We expect approximately $205 million of interest expense in Q1 '25.\nOther income expense was a $60 million benefit year-over-year primarily due to the favorable net impact of gains from balance sheet currency exposures and our hedging program. And finally, the Q4 tax rate was 17%, bringing the full year rate to 20%, with the year-over-year increase driven by growth in higher tax geographies, the unfavorable impact of discrete items and policy changes across the globe.\nLet's now discuss free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 12. We generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow in 2024, reflecting strong operating income growth and continued working capital improvements driven by the continued progress on our goal to improve days sales outstanding.\nWhile free cash flow was impacted in 2024 by extraordinary items, all of which we've previously communicated, including the NFP transaction and integration costs, restructuring and legal settlement expenses, we remain confident in underlying free cash flow growth. We continue to expect free cash flow to grow at a double-digit 3-year CAGR in 2023 to 2026.\nOur strong free cash flow allowed us to pay down $2.1 billion of debt in 2024 and coupled with earnings growth, lowered our debt-to-EBITDA leverage from 4.1x to 3.4x. So we are right on track to achieve a 2.8x to 3x leverage ratio in Q4 2025, consistent with the objective that we set when we announced the NFP acquisition.\nAdditionally, we remain active in M&A, continuing our targeted tuck-in acquisitions across priority areas, including continued middle-market acquisitions, which acquired $36 million in EBITDA in 2024 and has a healthy pipeline of expected closings in Q1 '25.\nOur independent and connected strategy is resonating in marketplace. And we continue to expect to acquire $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA through NFP middle market acquisition in 2025.\nFinally, in 2024, we returned $1.6 billion in capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases. Our performance in 2024 is a great demonstration of our disciplined capital allocation model, beginning with strong free cash flow generation and capital allocation that balances high-return investments for growth with capital return to shareholders.\nI'll wrap up on Slide 13 with our 2025 guidance and a few concluding thoughts. In summary, our full year 2025 guidance is mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and double-digit free cash flow growth.\nLet me highlight the drivers of each guidance point, starting first with organic revenue growth. We expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth driven primarily from winning recurring new business from both new logos and existing clients, continued high retention and 0 to 2 points from the net market impact of rate and exposure.\nI'll note that our increased talent acquisition of revenue-generating roles in specialty areas and enterprise client group hires, up 4% in 2024, is expected to contribute to organic revenue growth. Additionally, organic revenue growth is benefiting from our progress driving revenue synergies in NFP, and we remain committed to $8 million in NFP revenue synergies in 2025.\nMoving to adjusted operating margin. We expect to deliver continued margin expansion in 2025. And as we model the drivers of margin expansion, there are 4 components to consider. First, the net impact of 4 additional months of NFP, given the late April 2024 closing and achieving $30 million in OpEx synergies will dilute margins by 20 basis points. I'll note that the impact of 4 additional months of NFP will primarily be a Q1 impact with the remaining impact in April 2025.\nSecond, the interest rate impact on investment income from fiduciary balances is expected to dilute margins by 20 basis points. Third, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect an incremental $150 million in restructuring savings, which would drive approximately 85 basis points of margin expansion.\nFinally, we expect 35 to 45 basis points of margin expansion from the operating leverage in our business, given the progress that we've made in ABS to drive scale in our ongoing disciplined expense management. The net impact of these 4 items allows us to fund ongoing growth investments while still driving continued margin expansion in line with our historical performance.\nGiven our outlook for mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion and accretive NFP performance, we expect to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth in 2025. This guidance reflects our continued strong operating performance, partially offset by an approximately $0.32 or 2-point EPS headwind from FX rates based on today's FX rates remaining stable.\nIt's also important note that in Q1 '25, we estimate an approximately $110 million FX impact on total revenue and an approximately $0.16 or 3-point EPS headwind. Also embedded in this guidance is an expected tax rate of 19.5% to 20.5%, excluding any extraordinary discrete items. This tax rate considers the geographic mix of our growth and policy changes in the geographies where we are located.\nAdditionally, we expect noncash pension in OIE to be $88 million compared to $48 million in 2024. This performance positions us for double-digit free cash flow growth in 2025, including over $300 million from NFP driven by adjusted operating income growth and working capital improvements.\nAdditionally, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2025, including $1 billion in share repurchases. Our 2025 guidance demonstrates the strength of our business and financial model and prioritizes investments that support sustainable organic revenue growth.\nOur execution in ABS is supporting both top line growth and creating investment capacity through margin expansion. As a result, we expect to deliver strong adjusted earnings per share growth and to generate double-digit free cash flow growth. And finally, we continue to have balanced capital allocation, investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders.\nAnd before closing, one logistical note. Effective this quarter, we will disclose adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin for 2 operating segments: Risk Capital and Human Capital. Risk Capital includes commercial risk and reinsurance, and Human Capital includes health and wealth. These changes align our external reporting to our 3x3 Plan and how we go to market to serve clients. And they provide increased transparency to our investors on our ability to drive margin expansion across the enterprise.\nThe changes do not impact Aon's reported revenue or consolidated results. And we will also provide recasted financials for the past 3 years in our 10-K, which will be filed and posted on our website in the coming weeks.\nI will close with 4 messages. First, Aon delivered strong Q4 financial results to close out a strong 2024, in line with our financial guidance. Second, we are executing on our 3x3 Plan, including our investments in client-facing capabilities in Aon Business Services, middle market expansion and priority hiring to drive continued strong performance.\nThird, with our 2025 guidance, we are well positioned to continue Aon's long track record delivering mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and double-digit free cash flow growth. Finally, we continue to have balanced capital allocation priorities, investing in growth, while returning capital to shareholders.\nSo with that, let's jump into your questions. Rob, I'll turn it back to you."

Welcome to Aon plc's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. Additionally, we're delighted to be joined by Edwin Reese, who will succeed Christa as CFO on July 29. On our call today, Christa and I will provide our usual prepared remarks, and Edmund will highlight a few initial observations before he officially steps in to report Q3.\nAs in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We begin by thanking our colleagues around the world, including the 7,700 colleagues who welcome from NFP for the great work they do to deliver for clients, on each of the 3 pillars of our 3x3 plan, delivering risk capital and human capital solutions through our Aon client leadership model, scale by the Aon Business Services platform.\nLet's now turn to Edmund. Edmund, on behalf of Global Aon, we're thrilled to have you on our team and your first day on investor call as you officially step into the CFO role on Monday. Welcome.\n\nUnknown Attendee\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm incredibly excited to be here. First, I want to start by thanking my Aon colleagues for their very warm welcome. I've connected with literally hundreds of colleagues over the last month. And it's been great to meet everyone and really experience the energy and the enthusiasm of Aon, and the commitment to deliver on our plans, which is most exciting for me is seeing firsthand the investment in the corresponding growth opportunity for our clients, colleagues and shareholders as we deliver on a 3x3 plan over 2024, '25 and '26. And I have to say that with the 3x3 fully in place in '26 and the building momentum, equally compelling is the significant opportunity that will deliver value creation beyond '26 and over the long term. Finally, the financial model is strong, and the company is performing and well positioned to continue to deliver long-term double-digit free cash flow growth.\nI also want to add that I'm looking forward to meeting investors and the sell-side in talking through how we will deliver on our guidance and continue to allocate and invest their capital with discipline, focused on high-return investments and capital return, and, of course, reporting our third quarter results and fielding questions at that time. So Greg, back to you.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThanks, Edmund, and we're very excited to have you here. Before speaking to results in detail, we want to highlight a great example of the power of a united firm to deliver solutions where they're needed greatly. In Ukraine, until last month, there was no functioning low risk insurance market because carriers couldn't get reinsurance coverage due to standing war exclusions. Working with the U.S. and Ukranian governments, we created a solution that provides insurance and reinsurance capital to Ukrainian insurers, which has already brought in $350 million in new capital, encompassing a first-of-its-kind structure that facilitates new investments and economic recovery. This structure enables rebuilding and economic activity during the war and much more rapid investment in reconstruction and resilience longer term. This product couldn't have been created without global connectivity, expertise, data and analytics, on-the-ground relationships and local market knowledge and our proven ability to match risk and capital across private and public sectors. This innovative structure helps protect and grow the economy and helps the people of Ukraine recover and rebuild. It's a compelling example of the positive impact that our industry can have in addressing major challenges in the global economy.\nTurning now to current quarter results. In Q2, our team delivered 6% total organic revenue growth with all solution lines at 6% or greater, and both Aon and NFP delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. For clarification and transparency, the 6% organic performance for Aon is 6% without NFP. With this organic growth in addition of NFP, we delivered 18% total revenue growth, 19% adjusted operating income growth and margins of 27.4%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points from our combined 2023 margin baseline, including only 2 months of NFP. Year-to-date, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth, 11% total revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion, contributing to 12% adjusted operating income growth and 7% growth in earnings per share.\nTurning to our solution lines. In Commercial Risk, organic revenue growth of 6% reflects double-digit growth in EMEA and LatAm, with strong growth in North America, driven by net new business growth and strong retention. On average, we saw growth in exposures and generally flat pricing, resulting in moderately positive market impact. And while we're starting to see the turnaround in external capital markets, our M&A services business had a modest positive impact in the quarter, although the available pipeline remains strong and growing.\nFor NFP, growth for the 2 months was consistent with our North American business. Overall, a strong result. Finally, we're making great progress on priority talent acquisitions with continuing focus in this area and expect these new colleagues to contribute to further growth over time.\nTurning to reinsurance. 7% organic revenue growth in Q2 reflects strong growth in T&E, with strength internationally in LatAm, EMEA and APAC. We saw increased capacity in the U.S. property cat space, which provides ongoing opportunity for our clients to increase and optimize their coverage supported by our team's leading expertise, data analytics and insight. Health Solutions delivered 6% organic revenue growth with high single-digit growth globally in core health and benefits and real strength in consumer-facing and executive benefits, driven by new business wins. The market environment reflects an increased health care cost trend and positive impact from enrollment levels. NFP's contribution was consistent with Aon's performance, an impressive result in the midst of the closing. And finally, Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth was 9%, an outstanding result, reflecting ongoing strength in pension derisking, and core retirement.\nNFP also delivered strong growth, driven by asset inflows and market performance. Overall, we're pleased with both the top and bottom line growth in the quarter as we continue to deliver against our 3x3 plan on all fronts. Further, after only 2 months of NFP, early progress is fully on track, are ahead of expectations.\nFour key growth and value creation opportunities highlight this strong start. First, on independent and connected, outlining how we're bringing NFP into Aon. Our teams are coming together with a shared vision and client-first mindset, and they're building connectivity across Aon and NFP. Our early close is increasing momentum as we work together to deliver wins and bring the best from Aon and NFP to our clients.\nSecond, top line growth. We're seeing strong organic revenue growth from NFP. And though early, we're on track to deliver our revenue synergy commitments, noting that we modeled 0 net impact in 2024, NFP's strong client and colleague retention. Third, NFP's M&A engine is operating exceptionally well and the pipeline remains very strong. We've completed 14 deals so far in 2024 at attractive multiples weighted toward commercial risk and health. And we're finding that our independent and connected value proposition is distinctive and highly attractive.\nAnd fourth, bottom line growth. We're on track to fully deliver in line with guidance on all aspects of the combination through efficiencies, cost synergies and free cash flow impact leveraging operational best practices from Aon Business Services.\nIn summary, our Q2 and year-to-date results demonstrate progress against our financial guidance and our 3x3 plan, which will deliver superior content and capability across risk capital and human capital through Aon client leadership, ensuring we bring relevant client solutions all the time, all enabled through Aon Business Services. This performance will deliver compelling long-term value creation for clients, colleagues and shareholders.\nBefore I turn to Christa for one final time, I want to take a moment to thank her again for a great partnership, leadership and friendship, and for our inspiring and invaluable commitment to building our firm. Christa, over to you for your thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook.\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you so much, Greg, and thank you so much for the partnership. My time at Aon was and will continue to be the highlight of my career. I remain incredibly excited about the value creation potential we have ahead of us through the 3x3 plan. I'm thrilled to welcome Edmund, and I look forward to serving as an adviser to the team to support and ensure a smooth transition.\nTurning now to the quarter. As Greg highlighted, we delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, with 6% organic revenue growth highlighted by 7% in wealth and 7% in -- sorry, 9% in wealth and 7% in reinsurance. Our overall organic revenue growth does not include the impact -- does include the impact of NFP, beginning from April '25 when we closed the acquisition. So we only had 2 months performance. NFP's Q2 performance was in line with the business case as it delivered mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. NFP also contributed to the 18% total revenue growth in the quarter, which translated into a 19% adjusted operating income growth, margins of 27.4% and 6% adjusted per share earnings per share growth. These results position us well to drive progress against all elements of the 3x3 plan, driving results in 2024 and over the long term.\nAs I reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q2, driven by net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2024 and over the long term. As Greg described, we're making excellent progress with NFP. We continue to expect that NFP will contribute to the firm's overall revenue growth through organic revenue growth, including $175 million of net revenue synergies by 2026 and inorganic growth from ongoing M&A.\nWhile it's early, we're on track to achieve deal synergies with no net impact in 2024 from cost and revenue synergies and positive impact in 2025 and 2026. This is exactly in line with the guidance we gave when we announced the deal. It's also worth noting that voluntary colleague attrition at NFP is down year-over-year.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 33.8% in the first half, an increase of 20 basis points, driven by revenue growth, portfolio mix shift, efficiencies from Aon Business Services and restructuring savings, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. If we consider the combined historic margin profile of Aon and NFP, including 2/3 of NFP's results from the second quarter of 2023, adjusted operating margins expanded 60 basis points in Q2 and 80 basis points year-to-date, which is how we think about ongoing margin expansion. We're making meaningful progress on our Aon Business Services strategy, including through our restructuring program, which helps to accelerate our 3x3 plan and contributes to margin expansion through net savings.\nWe continue to streamline and improve operational processes, moving work to the best locations and enhancing colleague and client experience with powerful new tools such as our property, casualty, D&O, cyber and health risk analyzers.\nRestructuring savings in the second quarter were $25 million, resulting in $45 million of restructuring savings year-to-date and 60 basis points of contribution to adjusted operating margin year-to-date. Restructuring actions completed so far are expected to generate $95 million of savings in 2024. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom line. At this time, we continue to expect $100 million of realized savings in 2024 as we continue to accelerate our plans for Aon Business Services and our business.\nAs we think about adjusted operating margins moving forward, we continue to expect to drive adjusted operating margin expansion over the full year on a combined firm basis, and the long term through ongoing revenue growth, portfolio mix shift to higher revenue growth, higher margin areas of the portfolio, and efficiencies from Aon Business Services. As we previously communicated, we think that the right baseline from which to measure 2025 adjusted operating margin growth is 30.6%. Calculated is 31.6% from 2023, less 100 basis point drag from NFP for the period from the -- from the April '25 close through the end of 2024. We also expect fiduciary investment income to be relatively flat year-over-year based on current interest rate expectations. So we expect the tailwind we've seen in the first half of the year will be reduced in the back half. So we remain committed to driving full year adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term against this adjusted baseline of 30.6%.\nTurning to EPS. Adjusted EPS grew 6% in Q2 and 7% year-to-date, reflecting double-digit adjusted operating income growth and ongoing share buyback, partially offset by higher interest expense, the issuance of 19 million shares to fund the acquisition of NFP and a higher tax rate.\nTurning now to free cash flow. We generated $721 million of free cash flow year-to-date, reflecting strong operating income growth and lower CapEx, offset by payments related to NFP transaction and integration charges, legal settlement expense, restructuring and higher cash tax payments as we've previously communicated. As we look forward, our free cash flow outlook remains strong based on our strong expected operating income growth and a $500 million long-term opportunity in working capital. We've communicated that in the near term, free cash flow will be impacted by restructuring, higher interest expense and NFP deal and integration costs.\nIn 2025 and 2026, NFP is expected to add $300 million and $600 million of incremental free cash flow, respectively, contributing to our overall expectation of long-term double-digit free cash flow growth. We allocate capital based on ROIC and long-term value creation, which we've done through time through core business investment, share buyback and M&A. As we historically, we have a successful track record of balancing organic investment, acquisitions, divestitures and share buyback as we continue to optimize our portfolio against our priority investment areas on an ROIC basis. Given the very strong long-term free cash flow outlook for the firm, we expect share repurchase will remain our highest ROIC opportunity. We completed $500 million of buyback in the first half and continue to expect share buyback to be substantial at $1 billion or more in 2024 based on our current M&A expectations for the rest of the year. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs.\nRegarding M&A. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our high priority areas, including the mid-market and attractive geographies that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. Known that we closed an acquisition in France this quarter, bringing new specialist capabilities and health and benefits into Aon. We are also continuing to see success from NFP's impressive M&A engine. Since the beginning of 2024, NFP has completed 14 acquisitions at attractive multiples weighted towards commercial risk and health, representing $36 million in annualized revenue.\nAs we previously communicated, we expect NFP to do M&A comprised of $45 million to $60 million of EBITDA per year, and they are on track for the full year 2024. We look forward to building on their established track record and executing against this strong pipeline to drive future growth in the space and value creation within our ROIC framework. Going forward, we'll continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis, contemplating buyback, M&A and delevering.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet. As previously communicated, we expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the next 12 to 18 months, as we bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth, noting our track record of effectively managing leverage within our current ratings.\nIn summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date position us well to continue driving progress against all elements of our 3x3 plan and driving results in 2024 and over the long term. We look forward to building on this momentum.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and Greg, Eric and I'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind both partes that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated.\nInformation concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press conference covering our first quarter 2024 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case. CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. For your convenience, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. As always, we begin by thanking our colleagues around the world for the incredible work they do every day to support each other and deliver the best of our firm to clients. And this quarter, I also want to single out 1 colleague in particular. Our Chief Financial Officer; and my friend and partner, Christa Davies.\nAs you know, Christa announced a retirement from her role as CFO earlier this month, following over 16 years of tremendous service. With Christa's guidance, we developed a seamless plan. As previously announced, Christa remains in our CFO role for the second quarter earnings, and we're making strong progress against well-defined plans to have her successor in place to begin the handoff. I'm grateful that you'll continue to serve as a senior adviser into 2025 and to ensure great continuity. Now to begin our report today, it's important to start by highlighting an incredibly exciting milestone for our firm. The completion of our work to bring NFP into the Aon family as we closed the transaction yesterday. Through the 7,700 NFP colleagues who join our firm, welcome to Aon.\nNFP's client relationships, capabilities, focused sales force and market knowledge provides a meaningfully expanded position in the fast-growing $31 billion North American middle market. Since our announcement in late December, we've gotten to know the team even better and our appreciation and excitement for what we can do together has continued to grow, and the opportunity is even more clear.\nIn commercial risk, complementary specialist resources and expertise from both organizations will enhance what we bring to clients delivering Aon analytics and decision support tools to the NFP sales force allows for real differentiation on top of their highly integrated sales approach. Further, we can reintroduce and introduce, reinforce NFP's offerings with access to our programs and facilities like Aon Client Treaty and also in commercial risk, we can leverage our global Aon network for clients who require seamless global service to enhance an already strong NFP value proposition. In Wealth Solutions, we see great opportunity to bring our capabilities around pension risk transfer NFP clients as well as to continue to build on our investment offerings together, ensuring all clients have access to retirement options that best support their people.\nAnd in Health Solutions, our businesses are highly complementary with new opportunities in the health value chain where we don't operate today or for clients that we only serve in one solution line. And for example, NFP brings outstanding health value proposition for clients with under 100 employees. An attractive option for our smaller clients in commercial risk.\nConversely, we see great opportunity to provide NFP's clients with our data and analytics solutions, including benchmarking and tools on health equity, network strategies and high-cost claimants. Further, we can support current NFP clients with specialized capabilities in areas such as global benefits, pharmacy consulting and consumer benefits. Another great strength of NFP is their exceptional M&A engine and very strong acquisition pipeline as we look to the future.\nOn deal financials, we're delighted to close much earlier than originally modeled with fewer shares issued and realization of benefits that now occur a year earlier. Noting we now expect EPS accretion to 26 and thereafter and additional free cash flow of $300 million and $600 million in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nWe're incredibly excited about the opportunity as we bring Aon and NFP content capabilities together enabled by Aon Business Services. We also see great value and the operating model built around the principle of independent and connected to deliver risk capital and human capital capability to our clients.\nAll in, this acquisition is another strong step forward in our Aon United journey and reinforces our long-term financial guidance to deliver mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.\nTurning now to our results in the quarter. Overall, our team delivered a strong start to the year with 5% overall organic revenue growth, 100 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 9% EPS growth. Within our solution lines, Reinsurance delivered 7% organic revenue growth as our team help clients navigate continuing market challenges, but with greater capacity and stable pricing on programs. Further, our team is increasingly building on traditional capabilities with enhanced data analytics and advisory capabilities.\nIn Health Solutions, delivered 6% organic revenue growth, with strong growth in core health across all major geographies, driven by strong ongoing new business generation and retention and strength in specialist capabilities like consumer and pharmacy benefits. In Wealth Solutions. Organic growth of 4% reflected strength in retirement as our teams continue to help clients reduce risk through pension risk transfer and manage the ongoing impact of regulatory changes as we continue to bring leading capabilities to help clients match risk and capital.\nIn commercial risk, we saw 3% organic revenue growth highlighted by strength in Asia and the Pacific, Continental Europe and areas of our portfolio like construction. As we look at these results, especially in the U.S., we've seen the impact of our business mix play out. as we have strength and strong weighting in larger clients, especially lines like D&O, these are significant areas within our U.S. business, and again, areas where we're strong, and we see substantial long-term top and bottom line growth potential despite some current pressure reflected in net new business.\nGoing forward, we'll continue to be strong in these categories and continue hiring and investment in priority areas like energy and construction. We also observed, as we've mentioned previously, we're not seeing a real rebound yet in M&A and IPO activity, though we know there's demand and dry powder building. And until yesterday, we were relatively smaller in a $31 billion North American middle market. Although now with the close of NFP, we've added 7,700 colleagues and established a much more meaningful position in this fast-growing market.\nOverall, across the firm, we continue to focus on our most critical asset, our talent. Our engagement remains at historically high levels, and our voluntary attrition in Q1 is at the lowest level in many years. On talent acquisition, we continue to increase hiring in selected client-facing areas as well as an analytics capability to support our efforts in risk capital and human capital.\nIn summary, we're making great progress to start the year. Our first quarter results and the close of NFP put us in a strong position to continue delivering results through 2024 and over the long term. This progress fully reinforces our 3x3 plan focused on 3 fundamental commitments over the next 3 years, including capitalizing on our work in risk capital and human capital, delivering Aon client leadership and amplifying these efforts through Aon Business Services. The strength importance and momentum of this plan is being strongly reinforced by ongoing client and colleague feedback, and this plan defines a powerful path forward, one that drives ongoing top and bottom line growth and greater levels of long-term free cash flow growth exactly consistent with our ongoing financial guidance.\nFinally, as I turn the call over to Christa, I want to return to my opening comments and thank you again for her partnership, leadership and friendship. Ultimately, Crystal will have left a permanent imprint on our Aon United strategy. For 16 years, our shared mission has been to connect to our colleagues to a one-firm mindset so they can deliver more value to clients. That mission is universally focused on accelerating Aon United and now in arguably our most exciting period is fully reflected in our 3x3 plan.\nAnd Christa has been a critical partner in all this work. Our Aon colleagues will miss Christa and the CFO role personally, the journey with Krista is a highlight of my professional career. Our 52,000 colleagues and as of today, 60,000 and their families are in a better position because of Christa. And we're all grateful that Christa will be staying with us as a senior adviser to continue to drive momentum as she moves on to her next mission.\nAnd most important, we fully appreciate that there are other missions in life of higher priority, and we embrace Christa's decision to shift our focus at this time. Christa my friend, over to you.\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you so much, Greg. I want to start by thanking you for the opportunity over the last 16 years to contribute to the incredible success we've had at Aon. This will be the defining role of my career, and that's really what's at the heart of this decision. As you described, this decision isn't about other professional pursuits. My decision is to focus my time differently at the point in my life.\nI'm grateful that our work together has created the ability for me to make this choice. I must say as our 3x3 plan delivers on its full potential in the months ahead, including with the great addition of NFP. I'm going to truly this working so closely with this team to realize the tremendous value creation that is ahead for Aon. We're also very pleased to announce the completion of the NFP acquisition. I'm delighted to welcome the NFP to Aon.\nWe're excited to work together to capture the growth opportunities we see for clients, colleagues and shareholders. As we announced yesterday, we closed the transaction for a total enterprise value of $13 billion. The faster-than-expected close date means we now expect to achieve a similar benefit a year earlier with improvements in certain metrics noting, we maintained guidance for revenue and cost synergies of $235 million, which now occur a year earlier given the close date.\nWe achieved a lower interest rate on deal-related debt of 5.7%. The and we issued fewer shares at 19 million. Collectively, this results in similar deal related to natural benefits of accretion and free cash flow that are realized a year earlier than initially modeled. We now expect the deal to add $300 million to free cash flow in 2025 and $600 million in 2026 and be accretive in 2026 and over the long term. We've also provided detailed financial information for NFP in our materials.\nNFP built on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, it reinforces and accelerates our Aon United strategy and our 3x3 plan and adds to our strong momentum as we drive results in 2024 and over the long term.\nNow turning to the quarter. We delivered strong operational performance to start the year, highlighted by 5% organic revenue growth, which translated into 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 8% adjusted operating income growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. As Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5%, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation.\nI'd note that fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $79 million. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 70 basis points higher. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2024 and over the long term.\nAnd as we look forward, we continue to expect that NFP will contribute to the firm's overall revenue growth through organic revenue growth, including $175 million of net revenue synergies by 2026 and inorganic growth from ongoing M&A. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q1 with adjusted operating margins of 39.7%, an increase of 100 basis points driven by revenue growth, portfolio mix shift efficiencies from a business services and restructuring savings, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth.\nRestructuring savings in Q1 were $20 million and contributed 50 basis points to adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed so far are expected to generate $90 million of savings in 2024 and we expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom line. At this time, we continue to expect $100 million of realized savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans for Aon Business Services and our business. Regarding the program, we are seeing real progress in our acceleration of Aon business services. This includes streamlining and improving operational processes around working capital, moving work to the best locations and enhancing clients and colleagues experience with great new tools such as our property, casualty, D&O and cyber analyzers.\nAs we've said previously, we know delivering our Aon Business Services strategy will result in long-term top and bottom line growth as we drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. As we think about adjusted operating margins going forward, we continue to expect to drive margin expansion over the long term through ongoing revenue growth and portfolio mix shift to higher growth, higher margin areas of the portfolio driven by efficiencies from as and services.\nNow that we've closed NFP, margins will be initially lower. Considering the close timing, we think the right baseline from which to measure 2024 adjusted operating margin growth is 30.6%, calculated as our 31.6% in 2023 and less 100 basis point drag from NFP for the period from April 25 close through the end of 2024. In our materials, we've detailed 2023 operating performance for NFP. On a full year basis, we would note that NFP would have had a full year pro forma drag of 140 basis points for 2023. So there will be some ongoing drag on 2025 margins until we lap the close in April 2025.\nWe also expect fiduciary investment income to be relatively flat year-over-year based on current interest rate expectations. So the tailwind that we've seen in Q1 this year will be reduced although we remain committed to driving full year adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024 against this adjusted baseline of 30.6% and over the long term.\nTurning to EPS. Adjusted EPS grew 9% in the quarter, reflecting 8% adjusted operating income growth and ongoing share buyback, partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. With respect to NFP, as we previously communicated, we expect the acquisition to be dilutive to adjusted EPS in the remainder of 2024, breakeven in 2025 and accretive to adjusted EPS in 2026 and beyond.\nTurning to free cash flow. I'd note Q1 has historically been our seasonal is worth quarter from a cash flow standpoint due primarily to incentive compensation payments. And as we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We generated $261 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, reflecting strong operating income growth and lower CapEx, offset by higher receivables, payments related to E&O, restructuring, NFP transaction integration charges and higher cash tax payments as we've previously communicated.\nAs we look forward, we expect ongoing negative impacts of free cash flow in the near term from restructuring, higher interest expense and NFP deal and integration costs. The NFP acquisition strengthens our long-term free cash flow outlook with $300 million of incremental free cash flow in 2025 and $600 million in 2026. Over the long term, we would expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital.\nNow turning to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation, which we've done over time through core business investment, share buyback and M&A. Regarding M&A, as you look historically, we have a successful track record of balancing acquisitions, divestitures and share buyback as we continue to optimize our portfolio against our priority investment areas on an ROIC basis. We're incredibly excited about NFP's impressive M&A engine, noting the strong history of M&A. We look forward to building on their established track record and executing against their strong pipeline to drive future growth in this space within our ROIC framework.\nWe still expect share buyback to remain the top priority for capital allocation. As we think about capital allocation in 2024, we observed there are puts and takes around free cash flow that we've communicated. And while buyback will be lower than last year, we expect it will still be substantial at $1 billion or more based on our current M&A expectations for the rest of the year.\nWe have a very strong long-term free cash flow outlook for the firm and are confident that share repurchase will continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation over time. Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet.\nAs previously communicated, we funded the cash and assumed liabilities portion of the NFP purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt, with $5 billion raised in March 2024 and $2 billion borrowed at close. And I note the average interest rate for the $5 billion of transaction-related senior notes and the $2 billion term loan is 5.7%, about 80 basis points better than what we modeled when we announced the deal. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the next 12 to 18 months as we bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile.\n2.8x to 3x debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis. This is driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth noting our track record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings. In summary, our operating performance in Q1 is a strong start to the year, and we're well positioned to build on this momentum in the rest of the year.\nWe're delighted to have closed NFP acquisition ahead of schedule, enabling us to achieve financial benefits of accretion and free cash flow a year earlier than initially modeled. We look forward to enhancing NFP's strong client relationships with Aon's content and capabilities and see real opportunity to learn from each other and bring better solutions to our clients together.\nIt's another step forward in our 3x3 plan as we accelerate our Aon United strategy, capitalized by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon Plc's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated.\nInformation concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President.\nAs in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to start with a very sincere thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they've done in 2023, deliver for our clients and support each other.\nAs we reflect on 2023, we observed that the client demand driving our Aon United journey, trends around increasing volatility and interconnected risk have accelerated. Specifically, we see 4 broad areas of focus that increase the relevance of our core business and create opportunity to deliver more value to clients. These 4 megatrends revolve around trade and the consequence of sustained geopolitical uncertainty, technology, particularly the rise of AI, weather reflecting the rate of natural catastrophes and workforce where the pandemic has fundamentally impacted talent.\nThese profound transitions described in our Global Risk Management Survey and Human Capital Trends report, require clients to both deliver against today's expectations and evolve to make better decisions on new risk and people challenges. Against that backdrop, we've taken significant steps to accelerate our Aon United strategy in ways that drove performance in 2023 and set the stage to build momentum and deliver stronger performance in 2024.\nMost notably, we're executing our 3x3 plan to leverage our risk capital and human capital structure and capability, embed the Aon client leadership model across the firm and utilize Aon business services to set a new standard of innovation and client service. We then doubled down on this plan by announcing a $900 million investment into our business to accelerate Aon Business Services as a catalyst for the 3x3 plan and to complete workforce strategy efforts to reflect our simplified and more connected go-to-market strategy.\nWe closed the year with strong operating momentum and also took action to build upon our ABS driven capability to deliver innovative and accretive new products into the middle market by announcing our intent to acquire NFP under the leadership of Doug Hammond and an exceptional team is the premier operating platform in the middle market segment with tremendous client relationships and distribution. And together, we can bring stronger analytics and innovation to this space. And not just capability but content that can serve the middle market, like Aon Cyber Quotient evaluation or CyQu, a proprietary platform that helps clients identify, measure and manage cyber risk.\nNFP's operating platform will enable quick and efficient connections [ payout ] as a services content, driving meaningful growth in the middle market, and we're incredibly excited about the top and bottom line growth potential for NFP given our complementary businesses and expected synergies and the value over rate.\nFor Aon overall, and barely one month into 2024, we already feel the momentum from these actions thus demonstrated through the client benefits of our integrated risk capital and human capital capabilities. On the risk capital side, our recent weather climate catastrophe report highlights the growing frequency and severity of events around the world as clients look to manage volatility, enhance resilience and unlock opportunity.\nTo do this, organizations must have more actionable analytics, exactly the insight we bring with Risk Capital, through the combined power of reinsurance and commercial risk analytics and expertise for our clients. We recently saw this in action at our annual property symposium with over 1,000 clients and insurance markets in the room, where we demonstrated a new suite of advanced analytic tools that bring together content and capability across reinsurance and commercial risk.\nOne example is our property risk analyzer, giving clients better understanding of the risk profile in real time which allows us to work more closely together to provide better insight into the risk mitigation options and enables them to make better decisions. From the overwhelming feedback of engagement, it's clear our clients are demanding better solutions and greater support. And because of the steps we've taken and progress we've made with Aon Business Services on products and platforms, we can develop and roll these tools out more quickly for our largest clients and the clients of all sizes delivered efficiently at scale.\nEqually compelling for human capital. Our human capital trends report highlights the rising importance of clients of having a unique and differentiated value proposition for employees. We see clients facing significant rising health care apps and lower overall population health, but at a time when the need to provide broad health and well-being offerings is greater than ever. We also saw attracting and retaining top talent as the franked risk and our global risk management survey. Our clients realize it's more important than ever to have a compelling strategy across health, wealth and talent needs. That's delivered in an efficient way to maximize the benefit towards offering.\nTogether, this creates significant opportunity to work with clients to design and optimize their programs, including core offerings to improve colleague health, how operations drive workers' compensation costs, choosing optimal partners in their health model and supporting top talent through a strong employee value proposition to ultimately maximize return on investment of their people spend.\nAll these are examples of our 3x3 plan in action. It's human capital and risk capital. Delivered through our Aon client leadership model and enabled by Aon business services. These 3 pillars reinforce and accelerate our Aon United strategy, which has driven the financial performance and gives us great confidence in our outlook.\nOn financial performance, we delivered strong results in the quarter but contribute to full year progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter and 7% for the full year, was highlighted by full year double-digit growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. And we've maintained strong overall growth throughout the year on top of 6% organic in the prior year.\nIn the fourth quarter, commercial risk grew 4% organically with strength in property, casualty and construction, even against the headwind communicated in prior quarters of ongoing pressure from trends in the M&A and IPO markets. Wealth Solutions, organic growth of 5% in Q4 reflects strong growth in retirement, which includes growth from ongoing pension risk transfer projects and work to help clients address changing regulatory requirements.\nReinsurance Solutions organic growth was 14%, contributing to a full year organic growth of 10%, as our team closed the year strong while also helping clients prepare for and execute an [ Orly 1/1 ] renewal. Health Solutions delivered 11% organic growth, reflecting strength around the world in the core, driven by net new business and retention as well as strong growth in the U.S. consumer benefit solutions. This performance gives us confidence in our ability to drive ongoing growth across the portfolio, fully reflecting the strength of Aon United.\nFor the full year, 7% organic growth and ongoing operational improvement contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These strong results demonstrate our progress and momentum as well as the power of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services platform. This performance builds on our long-term track record of results.\nOver the past 12 years, we've strengthened and accelerated organic revenue growth in mid-single digits or greater. Delivered over 1,200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and growing EPS and free cash flow at 11% compounded annual rate, ending 2023 with nearly $3.2 billion in free cash flow.\nThe steps we've taken to accelerate Aon United with our 3/3 plan reinforce and strengthen our long-term financial guidance for the firm, including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth in 2024 and over the long term, adjusted operating margin expansion over the long term and long-term double-digit free cash flow growth. As we've communicated, initiatives like our restructuring program and expected acquisition of NFP impact this guidance in the near term, and over time, we believe these initiatives will contribute to significant ongoing shareholder value creation.\nMore important, we view the opportunity as higher over the next 5 years than at any time in our history. And in closing, we're pleased to report another strong year of progress against our Aon United strategy, which we're accelerating with our [ 3x3 ] plan deliver risk capital and human capital at scale, fully reinforce the our business services.\nLooking back on the year, we delivered accelerating growth across 3 of 4 solution lines and built momentum across the firm, including 7% full year organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 10% adjusted operating income growth and nearly $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Equally important, we took a series of major actions that position Aon for stronger performance in 2024 and over the coming years. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone.\nAs Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the fourth quarter to finish the year strong. In the quarter, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth.\nFor the full year 2023, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of margin expansion, 6% EPS growth and generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. In the quarter, we announced our definitive agreement to acquire leading broker NFP enabling us to unlock the fast-growing mid-market with Aon Business Services enabled enhanced distribution and further accelerate our Aon United strategy. The steps that we've taken around Aon Services now enable us to address this attractive market in a compelling way that delivers risk capital and human capital at scale to clients of all sizes.\nThe expected acquisition of NFP builds on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, we see the expected acquisition and our restructuring program, reinforcing our Aon United strategy and our 3x3 plan. We are extremely well positioned to build on this momentum as we head into 2024.\nAs I reflect on our results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7% in Q4 and for the full year, highlighted by double-digit organic revenue growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that reported revenue growth of 8% in Q4 includes a favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, and there's no net impact from changes in FX to full year reported revenue.\nI'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $78 million in Q4 and $274 million for the full year. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 8% in both Q4 and the full year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2024 and over the long term.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.8%, an increase of 60 basis points, driven by revenue growth, efficiencies for Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. For the full year, adjusted operating margins of 31.6% reflects margin expansion of 80 basis points. As previously communicated, there was no impact on margin from restructuring savings.\nLooking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom line and contribute to full year adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run rate savings in 2024.\nAt this time, we continue to expect $100 million of run rate savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans for Aon Business Services and our business. As we've previously communicated, we've conservatively modeled the expected acquisition of NFP to close midyear 2025. While the combined adjusted operating margin will initially be lower than Aon stand-alone, we expect over time to continue to improve Aon's overall margins through operational improvement and the impact from previously communicated cost synergies.\nTurning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was flat in Q4. Operating income grew 10%, but was offset by a headwind from a higher tax rate in the quarter and nonoperating expense. For the full year, organic revenue growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 6%, overcoming a headwind from nonoperating expense.\nI'd note the change in other nonoperating expense had a $0.15 per share or 4% unfavorable impact in Q4 and $0.98 per share or 7% unfavorable impact for the full year. This reflects an unfavorable impact from balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period, an increase in noncash net periodic pension expense as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period. Also, as noted in our earnings materials, FX translation had a favorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share in Q4 and an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full year. If currency remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material net translation impact to results for the full year 2020 call.\nAdditionally, in 2024, we expect noncash pension expense in OIE to be $43 million, spread evenly across quarters compared to $71 million in 2023. And as we've previously communicated, based on a mid-2025 close, the expected acquisition of NFP is expected to be dilutive in 2025, breakeven to adjusted 2026 EPS and accretive in 2027 and beyond. At this time, there are no further updates on the regulatory process or deal time line for NFP.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023. For the full year, cash from operations increased $216 million year-over-year or 7%, reflecting double-digit operating income growth and overall working capital optimization partially offset by higher cash tax payments. I'd note the negative impact to working capital caused by temporary inversing delays associated with the new system implementation which we communicated last quarter persisted in Q4 and impacted our overall continued progress on working capital.\nFree cash flow increased 5% as cash flow from operations was offset in part by a $56 million or 29% increase in CapEx. CapEx was $252 million in 2023 as we executed technology projects to drive long-term growth. Going forward, we expect CapEx to grow in line with the business, managed on a disciplined ROIC basis.\nLooking forward, free cash flow will be impacted in the near term by restructuring, higher interest expense, and the expected NFP deal and integration costs. We expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital. As we contemplate the expected acquisition of NFP, the transaction strengthens our long-term free cash flow outlook. We expect the transaction to add over $300 million of free cash flow in 2026 and $600 million of free cash flow in 2027.\nNow let me provide an update on our accelerating Aon United program, which is enabling Aon Business Services and our 3x3 plan. As Greg highlighted, 3x3 part is accelerating our Aon United strategy. We see particular opportunity around Aon Business Services as a catalyst. We are investing to standardize platforms and operations, drive data analytics-based product innovation and deliver at scale to create better tools, better experiences and greater relevance for clients and colleagues.\nIn the fourth quarter, we incurred $129 million of restructuring-related charges, with a cash outflow of $13 million. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the quarter, and we've incurred 12% of total expected cash restructuring charges. The actions we've taken in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run rate savings in 2024, contributing to the $100 million of cumulative savings we expect for the full year 2024. As mentioned, program savings were not material in 2023.\nAs we said previously, we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client vetting capabilities. We know delivering our strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics and will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders.\nTurning now to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation. And note, over time, we've driven value creation through core business results, share buyback and acquisitions. As you look historically, we have a successful track record balancing acquisitions and dispositions of all sizes and share buyback. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow over the long term, we expect share repurchase to continue remain our highest return on capital opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the $2.7 billion of share repurchase in 2023.\nWe expect to continue to invest organically in content and capabilities we can scale across the firm and we'll continue to assess priority areas for inorganic investment, noting our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. [indiscernible] we ended 2023 with an ROIC of 33.1%, an increase of nearly 2,100 basis points over the last 12 years, reflecting our track record of balancing growth and returns to create long-term value.\nI'd note, ROIC will initially be negatively impacted after the expected acquisition of NFP. We expect it to improve over time as we execute our Aon United strategy to drive long-term value creation. Our expected acquisition of NFP is consistent with our proven capital allocation framework. It enables us to put capital to work at scale and strengthen our free cash flow profile in the long term, which will continue to allocate to drive shareholder value creation. Between now and the expected close of the deal, we expect discretionary capital allocation will continue to be much more weighted towards share buyback given the commitments we've made around NFP.\nFollowing the expected close of NFP, free cash flow will be impacted in the near term by deal and integration costs and higher interest expense for transaction-related debt, and as we take steps to delever our balance sheet, and return metrics to levels consistent with our current credit ratings profile.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. We expect to continue adding debt supported by EBITDA growth until we complete the expected acquisition of NFP and expect to maintain our current ratings.\nAs we've previously communicated, we expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt with $2 billion border close and $5 billion raised in 2024, across a range of maturities subject to market conditions. Following the transaction-related debt issuance in 2024, we expect to incur approximately $12.5 million of negative interest carry expense per quarter until deal close.\nAs we previously communicated, the financing and capital management plan contemplated in the transaction is consistent with maintaining our current investment-grade credit profile. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the 12 to 18 months post close and we expect to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth, noting our track record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings.\nIn summary, in 2023, we delivered strong operational performance, contributing to continued progress against our Aon United strategy. Our strong financial results and discipline in capital management enable us to return $3.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The steps we've taken around our 3x3 plan are accelerating our Aon United strategy catalyzed by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program and our expected acquisition of NFP.\nWe remain incredibly excited about the opportunity to continue to drive top and bottom line results to drive value for clients, colleagues and shareholders and look forward to building on this momentum in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would also like to remind all parties that this is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated.\nInformation concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. As we begin the call today, we'd like to take a moment to reflect on the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza. We condemn violence anywhere that occurs in the world and remain highly concerned about all in harm's way. The safety and well-being of our colleagues and their families is always our top priority. And our team is in constant contact with our leaders in Israel to ensure our colleagues, their families and our clients have our full support.\nAs we reflect on the quarter, we want to start with a huge thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they do every day to support each other and to support our clients. Turning to financial performance. We delivered strong results in the quarter that contribute to year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics.\nOrganic revenue grew 6% in the quarter was highlighted by double-digit growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. Year-to-date, 7% organic revenue growth and ongoing operational improvement have contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth, a strong performance. In our Solution lines. Reinsurance Solutions delivered another very strong quarter of 11% organic revenue growth, with strong growth across Treaty, Fac and our Strategy and Technology Group.\nIn addition to delivering a strong quarter, our team is already helping clients prepare for the 2024 renewals. Health Solutions also delivered another very strong quarter with 10% organic revenue growth as our team continued to drive strong new and renewal business. We see ongoing focus from clients to address underlying trends impacting their workforce and health care costs, such as medical and wage inflation, population health, focus on well-being and overall talent engagement.\nWithin Wealth Solutions, organic growth of 4% reflected strength in retirement as our teams continue to sell clients with pension risk transfer and regulatory change. Finally, commercial risk organic revenue growth of 4% reflected strong renewals and net new business with strength internationally in EMEA and the Pacific. However, overall organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by the external M&A and IPO markets, as we communicated previously.\nToday, we're also excited to announce actions to go further faster on Aon United, and we will describe our plan and our restructuring program will accelerate key elements of our strategy. As always, our actions are driven by client need. For our clients, the difficult reality of the current world is evident everywhere as they face increasing challenges, understanding, measuring and dealing with risk.\nOur forthcoming Global Risk Management survey details this trend with input from over 3,000 public and private clients of all sizes across geographies and industries. Trade, Technology, Weather and Workforce Stability are simple forces in today's risk landscape. While each of these forces are individually impacting risk exposures, the increase in connectivity is compounding complexity and presenting new challenges to business leaders.\nResponding to our clients' increasing and evolving demand they'll protect and build their business, we are advancing a series of actions to further accelerate our Aon United strategy. These actions taken over the next 3 years will deliver outcomes that directly address client needs and demand. Specifically, we will improve the quality and availability and analytic tools available to clients, substantially improve their service experience and expand the quality and scope of solutions we bring to them. This work will put our clients in a much stronger position to make better decisions to support their companies.\nWe will accomplish this by delivering on 3 commitments over the next 3 years. Internally, we call this 3x3 plan. The 3 commitments include: first, leveraging our risk capital and unit capital structuring capability to unlock new integrated solutions across our core business but also address new requirements in client demand.\nSecond, embedding the Aon client leadership model across our enterprise clients in large and middle market segments to further strengthen and expand our client relationships; and third, accelerating Aon business services plan to set a new standard for service delivery, and next-generation analytic tools.\nThe benefits of this plan accrue to our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders. Colleagues win with greater capability to serve clients. Today, our team is exceptional in their client leadership focus and impact and this work provides them with next-generation tools and capability to serve clients and to meet increasing client demand.\nClients win with better solutions and better service. This work resets client service to a higher standard and provides analytic tools and solutions required to meet demand and investors win through our greater client relevance, continuing margin improvement and sustained double-digit free cash flow growth.\nAnd while we could have achieved these benefits over time, we have instead decided back now and accelerate a proven strategy. Let me describe where our team came to this conclusion. The last 10-plus years have demonstrated that a more connected firm is a more capable firm, and the connecting Aon is a done in concept that's accomplished through meaningful structural change, which must be embraced and led by colleagues. It is cultural and only viable as a defining part of our DNA.\nAnd even though we remain on a journey with plenty of distance to travel and opportunity ahead to improve, we have made progress, and the results have been meaningful for clients in terms of innovation and support for colleagues in the form of excitement and engagement currently at an all-time high and for shareholders, measured by sustainable value creation including a 30.8% full year 2022 operating margin, compound free cash flow growth of 13% a year from 2010 to 2022 and return on invested capital at year-end 2022 of 30.6%.\nHowever, 2 observations give us conviction that going further faster is a requirement. The first is increasing client demand. And the second is our execution confidence based on our proven track record, the 3x3 action plan we have defined and the diligent work already underway.\nAccelerating our plan requires greater upfront investment. And as announced in our press release, we will execute this through a $900 million restructuring program focused on 2 areas. First is on accelerating our Aon Business Services plan by focusing on standardized operations, integrating operating platforms and driving product innovation. And the second is on workforce planning to align skills and capability required to deliver on the digital first opportunity embedded in AI business services as well as workforce changes to strengthen our client-serving capability and risk capital and human capital.\nThis investment will also drive $350 million of cumulative annual run rate savings by year-end 2026, which Christa will describe in more detail. Overall, our team is very excited about the opportunity to accelerate our plans to strengthen client leadership and fortunate that we have the opportunity and options to take this step as a direct result of the work of our colleagues.\nWe continue to expect to drive mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the course of 2023 and the long term. We further expect these savings will contribute to ongoing annual margin expansion. And while the program will impact free cash flow in the near term, over the long term, we expect to continue to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth driven by operating income and working capital improvements.\nIn summary, our strong year-to-date operational performance, including 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth demonstrates strong momentum against our Aon United strategy. It creates the opportunity for us to double down on our strategic commitments around risk capital, human capital, our client leadership model and Aon Business Services. These steps will enable us to continue to address evolving client demand, improve colleague outcomes and continue our track record of long-term shareholder value creation.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth.\nThese results position us very well to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year. As I reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q3 and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term.\nI would also note that reported revenue growth of 10% in Q3 includes a favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies compared to the prior year period. Reported revenue growth of 7% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX 1%, primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies compared to the prior year period.\nI'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth with $80 million in Q3 and $196 million year-to-date, or 3% of total revenue in Q3 and 2% of total revenue year-to-date.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first 9 months of the year with adjusted operating margins of 30.8%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth.\nWe translated double-digit adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 15% in Q3 and 8% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share in Q3 and an unfavorable impact of $0.20 per share year-to-date. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we would expect a favorable impact of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, totaling an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full year 2023.\nI'd also note the change in other nonoperating expense had a $0.15 per share or 7% unfavorable impact in Q3 and a $0.59 per share or 6% unfavorable impact year-to-date. This reflects an unfavorable impact from an increase in noncash net periodic pension expense as well as balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period and a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period.\nTurning to free cash flow. Cash flow from operations decreased $3 million year-over-year, reflecting double-digit operating income growth, offset in part by higher cash tax payments as we mentioned previously, and the negative impact to working capital in the third quarter caused by temporary invoicing delays associated with the implementation of a new system.\nFree cash flow decreased 4% to approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by a $77 million increase in CapEx. CapEx was elevated in the first 9 months of the year compared to the prior year period as we executed a number of technology projects to drive long-term growth. And net CapEx could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and we expect CapEx to moderate in the fourth quarter to total CapEx investment of $220 million to $250 million in 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis, and we expect it to grow the business going forward.\nNow let me share more details about our accelerating Aon United program. As Greg highlighted, we are doubling down on 3 strategic commitments, including accelerating Aon Business Services, which in turn enables us to unlock advancers in risk capital and human capital and our Aon client leadership strategy. Together, these commitments will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders.\nThe investment to accelerate our 3-year Aon Business Services operating model focuses on the same 3 areas we've mentioned previously. We see proven benefit and will now accelerate. Number one, standardized operating operations; number two, integrating operating platforms; and number three, increasing product innovation and development. We've already made considerable progress in standardizing our operations, but we see significant opportunity both within and across our solution lines. The work we're doing to standardize operations will drive integrated service delivery platforms, which provide additional opportunities to standardize how we do business and standard operations, combined with integrated platforms enables more effective new product development and innovation at scale.\nBy accelerating standardization across the portfolio and establishing fewer more integrated platforms, we'll be able to deliver more analytical tools to colleagues and clients across the entire portfolio. With this underlying infrastructure in place, we'll be able to leverage advances in AI and machine learning to further accelerate the product development cycle and unlock new efficiencies across the portfolio.\nLet me provide a bit more financial detail about the strategic investment. We expect total annual in-year savings of $350 million to be achieved in 2026, contributing to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion. I'd note, we expect savings to ramp over time with annual [ India ] savings expected to be $100 million in 2024, $250 million in 2025 and $350 million in 2026.\nWe do not expect material savings or impacts to cash flow in 2023. Cash restructuring charges of $900 million reflects a savings ratio of 2.6x and a largely to technology costs and workforce optimization. I'd note you can think of the $900 million cash restructuring charge as less than 10% of underlying free cash flow over the next 3 years and the $350 million of savings as a 4% cost takeout relative to our cost base of approximately $9 billion.\nWe also expect an additional $100 million of noncash charges, largely related to asset and lease impairments. We do not expect significant incremental CapEx associated with the program, and we expect CapEx will grow in line with the business in the future from our guidance of $220 million to $250 million in 2023.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we incurred $6 million of restructuring charges, and we'll communicate charges and savings going forward each quarter. Contemplating the program. As we look forward, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. We expect program savings will contribute to ongoing sustainable long-term margin expansion and expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023, 2024 and over the long term.\nAs we've noted previously, over the last 12 years, we've delivered 1,120 basis points of margin expansion or about 90 basis points a year on average. Our outlook for free cash flow remains strong. We expect to deliver high single-digit free cash flow in 2023. I'd note this guidance contemplates the impact from restructuring on free cash flow in Q4, so we do not expect restructuring to have a material impact on cash flow this year. While free cash flow will be reduced in the near term by restructuring, we expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term, driven by operating income growth and ongoing working capital improvements.\nAs we've said previously, as we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client-facing capability, we know that delivering this strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics: organic revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth.\nNow turning to capital allocation. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by nearly $2 billion of share repurchase year-to-date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs.\nOur M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis.\nComing now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile and expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA grows over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade [indiscernible].\nIn summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date reflect strong operational performance, driven by our Aon United strategy and our Aon Business Services platform. We see an opportunity to accelerate the next stage of our Aon United strategy and expect this investment will contribute to sustainable long-term top and bottom line growth and ongoing shareholder value creation.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nWe're pleased to report that our global team delivered another strong quarter, performance, results and momentum. And we begin the call today by thanking our colleagues for everything they do to help our clients address immediate and long-term demands around the risk and people. United delivered by our colleagues, gives us the ability to meet this demand and balance across our portfolio. capitalizing on innovation and momentum and investing to meet demand. This ensures we win more, retain more and do more with our clients. There is now almost universal agreement to client demand to address risk and human capital has never been greater. For example, our catastrophe Insight report estimated global economic losses for natural disasters in the first half of 2023 and were $194 billion, notably above the 21st century average of $128 billion and fifth highest on record.\nEven more profound, in addition to economic costs, we know these disasters have tragic human costs that reinforces the high value and building resiliency and protection in advance of disaster. To this end, we recently announced the placement of the Parametric insurance program for the government of Puerto Rico. It's the single largest program of its kind that the U.S. Commonwealth has ever placed. This program was designed by our reinsurance and commercial risk teams. And in the event of a sizable earthquake or hurricane, Puerto Rico will quickly receive liquidity and enabling its government to focus on rapid recovery and reconstruction.\nThis placement was the result of Aon's data, analytics and capabilities from across our firm, cemented by our deep understanding of public entity demand, risk capital and reinsurance markets and really, really great work by our team. Turning to financial performance. In the second quarter, we delivered strong organic revenue growth across our solution line, including 10% growth in Health Solutions and 9% growth in [ reinsurance ] Solutions contributing to 6% overall organic growth in the quarter and 7% in the first half. In Health Solutions and a revenue growth of 10% on top of 11% last year was driven by strength in the core. Our team has done terrific work, helping clients navigate the demands of their talent agendas balancing optimal benefits for their people with inflationary cost pressures while also taking steps to deliver on their people strategy at a time when bringing total rewards, health and wealth benefits together is human capital are more important than ever.\nIn Reinsurance Solutions, our team delivered another very strong quarter at 9% organic growth on top of 9% last year. Driven by strong net new business generation, our teams continue to help clients navigate a challenging and complex market and are already preparing data, analytics and insight as we help our clients understand and address ongoing volatility and capital considerations. We're also seeing capital come into the market, particularly in cat bonds as our team has placed over $5 billion across 21 deals year-to-date. In Wealth Solutions, we delivered 2% organic growth driven by ongoing trends in demand we've seen in project work around market volatility and regulatory changes, as well as the ongoing trend of pension derisking, which we expect to continue in the quarters coming ahead, given the market conditions.\nWe continue to see opportunity to help clients react and prepare for regulatory changes, and market volatility with our data analytics and expertise. And finally, Commercial Risk Solutions delivered 5% organic growth in the quarter. Globally, we saw strong growth across most major geographies with double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific. In the U.S., we saw strength in core retail brokerage, including from property, casualty, and construction. As we've communicated previously, results were pressured by the impact of external M&A and IPO markets on M&A services, a headwind we now expect to continue in the back half of the year, given ongoing external conditions.\nOverall, in the quarter, our strong performance was driven by the strength of our Aon United strategy and Al Business Services platform. In Q2, we translated 6% organic revenue growth into 110 basis points of operating margin expansion. Net of ongoing investment in the business for long-term growth. These results contributed to first half financial performance of 7% organic revenue growth and 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. And we remain very well positioned to maintain this momentum and to deliver on our ongoing financial guidance of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth for 2023 and the long term. This financial performance is ultimately the product of our ability to address client needs to Aon United. And this strength is foundational in supporting our ability to evolve in response to changing client demand, fully demonstrated by our move to risk capital and human capital.\nThis focus is bringing our 4 solution lines more closely together to better address client needs and is already yielding meaningful client impact. Take human capital. Our clients are changing how they're thinking about their colleagues. We're facing an increasingly complex external environment with pressures around cost, growth, remote and hybrid work and workforce composition. On their own internal environment, their people strategies are increasingly complex, considering traditional total rewards and health benefits and newer additions around future skills and well-being. Our connectivity and across health, wealth and talent, enables us to bring data, analytics and solutions to address this need. In one great example, our team developed a diagnostic tool for clients that produces a human sustainability index, or -- this tool combines individual and team assessments with peer data and analytics-based benchmarking to enable our clients to directly connect people strategy goals to execution.\nThe [ metal ] results encompassing 8 wellness pathways such as physical, emotional and financial aspects, supports individuals and teams to assess exactly what's working and for whom, along key metrics, so our clients can adjust or change their tactics to drive their people strategy and ultimately, their bottom line. In many respects, this work represents bringing next level data science into talent development and leadership. Ultimately, the HSI solution identifies gaps and what our clients offer to their people, encompassing health, wealth, rewards, and other wellness programs, and it provides a trackable plan to strengthen the company's talent strategy on their most significant often external commitments at a time when these commitments are more important than ever.\nIn summary, our strong performance is a direct result of our ability to help clients better understand their challenges and opportunities and to take actions to protect their business and improve their performance. Further, our recently announced enhanced focus on risk capital and human capital is already driving benefits and strengthening this capability. Our strong year-to-date financial results, including 7% organic revenue growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion, on the direct outcome of the strategy and position us very well to continue delivering in 2023 and over the long term. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we continued delivering on our key financial metrics, both in the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first half, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. These results position us very well to continue to drive results in 2023 and over the long term, and we look forward to building on this momentum.\nAs I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 6% in Q2 and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 7% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date -- sorry, 6% in Q2, 7% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date, includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 1% for Q2 and 2% year-to-date, primarily driven by a strong dollar versus most currencies. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, with $64 million in Q2 and $116 million year-to-date or 2% of total revenue in both periods. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 33.6% in the first half, an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue growth and efficiencies from May on business services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth.\nLooking forward, we expect to deliver sustainable margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've said previously, Aon Business Services remains one of our key drivers of margin improvement, and this operating model has now reached an inflection point. In response to client demand and the opportunity, we're evolving to an organization that drives efficiency, operating leverage and margin expansion to one that's also increasingly driving improved client service delivery and accelerating innovation at scale. This evolution of Ambu Services requires investment in 3 areas, which we expect to manage in line with our ongoing financial guidance and like we do for all investments in long-term growth, on a disciplined ROIC basis.\nFirst, standardized platforms. We're digitizing and connecting existing platforms and creating an ecosystem that encompasses technology and operations that brings our data, analytics and expertise together for our clients and our colleagues. Second, standardized operations. Across our solution lines, there are places where we have common processes. We see opportunity to continue to bring operations and expertise together across our firm, to support clients across all solution lines, bringing people and process together, drive further efficiency enables us to scale best practices. Third, new products at scale. We see significant opportunity to deliver new data-driven products, which we can then effectively develop and scale. The work we've done to standardize platforms and operations enable us to rapidly develop, deliver and scale innovative solutions across the portfolio. In response to client demand and to deliver content and capability to all clients both from organic or inorganic investments.\nEven more importantly, operating Aon as a Services as one organization with disciplined prioritization and governance around initiatives ensures we can move quickly on opportunities that create value for our clients and colleagues, such as the one we see on AI. Just as a few examples. We see real opportunity here to enhance colleague productivity by leveraging the services of our technology partners in a protected environment to enhance existing offerings like our human capital assistance by building an AI risk framework for our clients. And finally, to create complementary data sets to enhance our risk analytics like the catastrophe modeling. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into adjusted EPS growth of 5% in Q2 and 6% year-to-date.\nAs noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 in the quarter and $0.19 per share year-to-date. If currency is to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no impact in the third quarter and a favorable impact of $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter for an unfavorable impact of $0.14 per share for full year 2023. I'd also note, other nonoperating expense had a $0.25 per share or 10% unfavorable impact in Q2, and a $0.44 per share or 6% unfavorable impact year-to-date. This reflects an unfavorable impact from increase in noncash net periodic pension expense, as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period and balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Cash from operations was flat year-over-year and free cash flow decreased 7% to $986 million, primarily driven by a $77 million increase in CapEx. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally stronger than the first half. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year. CapEx was elevated in the first half of the year compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects with spend heavily weighted in the first half across technology to drive long-term growth like the investments we're making to evolve Aon Business Services. I'd note CapEx can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter.\nWe expect CapEx to moderate in the back half of the year and now expect an investment of $220 million to $250 million in CapEx in 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis. Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvement. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today highlighted by approximately $1.1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.\nWe also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capability that we can scale to address unmet client need. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. As we've said before, we expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA growth over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit profile. I'd note our term debt is all fixed rate with an average weighted interest rate of approximately 4% and an average weighted maturity of approximately 11 years.\nIn summary, our strong financial results for the quarter and year-to-date reflects strong operational performance driven by our Aon United strategy and our Aon Business Services platform. We expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nBefore we begin, as always, we want to thank our colleagues for the great work they are doing every day around the world to help our clients and each other. We continue to live in a world where volatility, complexity and uncertainty are increasing. And in this environment, our clients are being asked to make decisions faster than ever. And as a result, we see strong and ongoing demand for our advice and solutions, as many of our clients realize that remaining in defensive or reactive mode is not sufficient. And in fact, if [ given ] to offense is ultimately necessary to win and achieve their objectives.\nClients are telling us there are 2 primary areas where they're urgently looking for a competitive advantage: Risk and People. Addressing these challenges requires that we bring the best from across our firm to enable our clients to make better decisions, which is the core of Aon United.\nGiven these ongoing demand, our strategy positions Aon as uniquely capable of helping clients go on offense and make better decisions that mitigate risk to their business and maximize the impact and engagement of their people.\nTake ESG or Environmental, Social and Governance as an example. These are major interconnected categories that cut across traditional silos. Our clients need a broad strategic view to understand and assess all the risks around ESG and any targeted solutions and capabilities to solve for these risks.\nOur recently published ESG impact report describes our work helping clients address these issues as well as the impact across our firm. And we're delighted to report on our own progress against long-standing commitments in these essential areas.\nFirst, on environmental. We're making progress toward our goal of net zero emissions by 2030 and have reduced our overall Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions footprint by 16% from our 2019 baseline and by 4% in 2022, enabled by efforts like smart working and supplier centralization through Aon Business Services.\nOn social, and specifically around our colleagues, Aon United is not just a strategy. It's our culture, and it reflects our commitment to inclusion, diversity and the well-being of our colleagues. This year, we're continuing to embed IND principles and practices and to hold ourselves accountable with increased transparency and oversight at all levels of the organization, starting at the top with our Board of Directors.\nOn diversity, for example, we reported progress in 2022 and the percentage of female people managers and U.S. ethnically and racially diverse managers. In 2022, we also enhanced focus on learning, development, engagement and wellbeing. Because we know that supporting our colleagues is not only the right thing to do for them, but it also ensures we retain, grow and develop the best talent to continue to support our clients.\nAnd finally, on governance. We've highlighted Board review of top ESG and climate-related risks and actions from our ESG Steering Committee as well as steps on cybersecurity and privacy, all aligned with our long-standing overall enterprise risk management strategy.\nWhile we're proud to report on these steps in our report, there is still work to do, and at the same time, we're even more excited about the work we're doing to help clients, as many risks connected to progress on ESG align with our core businesses.\nOn the people side, for example, we continue to develop new solutions while bringing together existing capabilities across different markets and geographies to address specific needs. One recent client, facing significant organizational change, realize many of our employees were unsure and unclear about titles, career ladders, compensation mechanics. And at the same time, this client needed to reduce cost, increase efficiency and simplicity, which they knew would drive engagement. To address, we brought expertise from around the firm. Our commercial risk team brought deep understanding of this client strategy and desired culture. Our Aon Business Services platform served as a powerful example of how we could help them simplify their operations and reduce costs.\nFinally, our health and human capital teams brought a series of solutions, including optimization of global benefits and a skills taxonomy strategy to increase employee alignment and engagement. And while the solution leverages many existing offerings, the real innovation is bringing these pieces together along with our Aon Business Services team, who provided insight and change management expertise around moving to a Business Services model, an essential piece of the puzzle for our client.\nThe result, our client is driving increased engagement with a clear, more effective benefit structure and talent strategy and outsourcing capabilities that will help drive simplicity and efficiency, all enabled by our teams coming together as Aon United. And we see examples like this across the firm every day as we help our clients manage risk and support their people. They demonstrate the opportunity we have to continue delivering innovative solutions at scale to address our clients' unmet needs at a time when doing so has never been more important.\nTurning to financial performance. In the first quarter, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth across our solution lines, with 9% growth in Reinsurance, 8% growth in Health Solutions and 6% growth in both Wealth Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions.\nIn reinsurance, our teams were exceptional in guiding our clients to the 1/1 renewal environment. demonstrating the strength of our team's advice, data-driven analytics, modeling and execution capabilities.\nIn Health Solutions, we saw strength in core H&B and ensuing capital in a seasonally larger quarter for European health renewal, as our teams help clients navigate the ongoing challenging environment for their people, encompassing employee health, rewards, engagement and well-being.\nIn Wealth Solutions, our team delivered another very strong performance with 6% growth, driven by ongoing trends around regulatory changes like GMP equalization, pension risk transfer and the levering impacts of the fixed income market volatility as our teams help clients reassess and potentially adjust their strategies. We would note that after 2 very strong quarters, Q2 '23 will be impacted by performance fees in the prior year period.\nAnd finally, Commercial Risk Solutions grew 6% in the quarter, with strength in Europe and the U.K. in their seasonally largest quarter. Overall, we observed the property market remains an area of increasing challenge and volatility. Market dynamics are causing reinsurers to shift risk appetites, requiring primary areas to accept more risk, which in turn means property placements are even more challenging for our clients. In this environment, our strength in analytics and the ability to respond to clients' need for cover in a capital-agnostic way, bringing capability across reinsurance and commercial risk is essential. Our capabilities enable us to assess an ally's integrated broking options, including traditional risk placements, wholesale, MGAs, facultative captives and insurance-like securities. By helping clients assess options across capital sources, we ensure they were able to optimize their own total cost of risk and risk appetite.\nFor example, one client came to us looking to consolidate to a single property and [ terrorism ] program across 11 asset classes with over $80 billion in property values. Our team came together seamlessly across geographies and specialties, the developer program that leverage traditional carriers around the world and a captive, successfully completing the program and driving significant cost savings for our clients, all enabled by the work we've done to break down barriers within our firm through Aon United.\nOverall, in the quarter, we're pleased with performance of the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services platform translated 7% organic revenue growth [ into ] 70 basis points of operating margin expansion, net of ongoing investment in the business for long-term growth.\nIn this period of ongoing external volatility and increasingly interconnected risk, the opportunity for us to help clients is greater than ever, position us very well to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial performance and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operational performance in the first quarter, highlighted by 7% organic revenue growth that translated into 70 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. This is a strong start to the year, and we're very well positioned to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term.\nAs I reflect on the quarter, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7%, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term.\nI would also note that reported revenue growth of 5% includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 3%, driven primarily by a weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar, as Q1 is our seasonally largest quarter for euro-denominated revenues. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth, was $52 million or 1.4%.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 38.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies of Aon Business services, overcoming expense growth, including some investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E, especially compared to the prior year period when business travel was still suppressed by COVID-19.\nLooking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis.\nAs we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of a full year, driven by 3 areas. The first is top line revenue growth. The second is portfolio mix shift to higher-margin businesses as we invest disproportionately in areas of increasingly client demand, supported by data-driven solutions. And the third area is increased operating leverage from ongoing productivity improvements from our Aon Business Services platform.\nI'd highlight, Aon Business Services continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in an inflationary market. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improve quality and service and increase innovation at scale. And related to Aon Business Services, I'd like to highlight the essential role of Aon Business Services in enabling our climate net-zero goals.\nAs a professional services firm, the biggest part of our own emissions is from our supply chain. Through the Aon Business Services organization, 90% of the spend is managed through preferred channels, which enables us to drive efficiency and also deploy decarbonization strategies. As Greg said, this resulted in a 4% reduction in emissions last year, while also allowing us to increase supply diversity utilization to 6% of our addressable U.S. spend in support of our goals around inclusion and diversity, both meaningful accomplishments that are enabled by our Aon United strategy.\nOrganic growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 7%. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.14 per share. If current [ situation ] remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.14 per share for the full year 2023.\nI'd also note other expense had a $0.19 per share unfavorable impact in the quarter, including a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from an increase in noncash net periodic pension costs, in line with what we communicated previously, as well as an unfavorable impact from a gain on sale of business in the prior year period and balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period. We expect the $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from increased net periodic pension costs to continue for each quarter this year, and we currently expect gains on divestitures to be immaterial for the full year.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. I'd note Q1 has historically been our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. And as we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Free cash flow decreased 17% to $367 million, primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and a $53 million increase in CapEx.\nCapEx was elevated in the first quarter compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects, with spend heavily weighted in Q1 across technology to drive long-term growth and real estate aligned with our smart working strategy. I'd note, CapEx can be lumpier quarter-to-quarter, and we expect an investment of $200 million to $225 million to 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis. Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements.\nGiven our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by approximately $550 million of share repurchase in the quarter. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs.\nOur M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q1, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior notes, consistent with our past practice, and expectation to add incremental debt as EBITDA grows over the long term, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.\nFactoring in this issuance, I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 11 years. Our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, driven by our Aon United strategy. We start the year in a position of strength and expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value creation.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to also remind parties that this call is being recorded.

Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nWe begin today by thanking Aon colleagues around the world. Our strong performance in the fourth quarter and through 2022 and our strong momentum as we start 2023, continues to reflect tremendous dedication by our colleagues and the power of our Aon United strategy to support clients, both in their demands of today and as they plan to address their needs of tomorrow.\n2022 was a year in which we continue to see clients focus on both the challenges and opportunities from increasing global risk and the opportunities to engage clients continues to grow. In commercial risk, our latest weather climate and Catastrophe Insight report sized global economic losses from natural catastrophes at $313 billion, 4% over the 21st century average and it was only 42% covered by insurance, $190 billion protection gap.\nIn Wealth Solutions, equity and fixed income market volatility in the back half of the year created demand for our Wealth Solutions colleagues to help organizations reassess retirement readiness and financial well-being. And in Health Solutions, which includes our human capital business, the continuation of broad trends around a changing workforce, encompassing health, culture, wellness, engagement and inclusion, our growing and focus and importance across the C-suite and the stakes have never been higher.\nIn this environment of increasing risk and complexity across so many fronts, our colleagues are increasingly relying on Aon United. This would enable them to bring the full force of our firm, including core offerings and innovative solutions at scale to address evolving client demand.\nTurning to financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%, highlighted by 9% growth in reinsurance, 7% growth in Health Solutions and 6% growth in Wealth Solutions. In reinsurance, our teams were able to deliver strategic advice and data-driven analytics very early on in the renewal process to help clients navigate difficult market dynamics. This market leadership benefited our clients greatly in a challenging 1/1 renewal and reflects our strong performance.\nIn Health Solutions, we saw strength in our core H&P and human capital. Both of which benefited from enhancements to our offerings, tools and platforms and increased client focus on employee health, rewards, engagement in well-being. In Wealth Solutions, our team delivered the strongest quarterly organic revenue growth in over 5 years. As our teams worked tirelessly to respond to client demand resulting from market and interest rate volatility, particularly in the U.K. and continue to help clients execute on pension risk transfer, strategic pension management and respond to regulatory changes.\nAnd finally, commercial risk grew 4% in the quarter and 6% for the year. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in Canada and Latin America and strong growth in Europe, the U.K. and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., otherwise strong results continue to reflect the impact of the external M&A and IPO environment on M&A services. This impact reduced quarterly organic growth by 5%, an annual growth by 2.5%. And while this short-term pressure may continue into Q1, over the long term, we are very well positioned in this highly attractive business but has significant opportunity to contribute to long-term top and bottom line growth.\nFor the full year, our organic revenue growth of 6% is a direct result of our Aon United strategy and is a key driver of strong top and bottom line results for the full year. Noting adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points to 30.8%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $13.39, overcoming a 3% or $0.44 FX headwind. Free cash flow exceeded $3 billion with free cash flow margins of 24.2%, both our highest ever, and we completed $3.2 billion of share buyback, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of the firm.\nOur team's performance positions us exceptionally well to deliver in 2023 and over the long term. Looking back, since 2010, we've reported 4% average organic revenue growth. Over 1,100 basis points of margin expansion or about 90 basis points per year, while adjusted EPS and free cash flow increased at a compound annual growth rates of 12% and 13%, respectively.\nMore important, we view the go-forward opportunity and momentum higher now than any time in our history. Looking ahead, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the firm, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term.\nReflecting on the year, we would offer a few observations on how Aon United continues to deliver for clients. The steps we've taken over the past decade, including our single brand and single P&L, put us in an exceptionally strong position to deliver for clients and have significant impact on some of the greatest opportunities and challenges they face. These ideas are not new. There are a continuation of over a decade of progress on the areas highlighted in our Aon United blueprint, clients, colleagues, innovation at scale and Aon business services that are increasingly interconnected and mutually reinforcing.\nOn delivering innovation at scale, the platform we've built not only enables innovation of new concepts as we've demonstrated in areas like intellectual property solutions and climate, but increasingly enables us to bring together our analytics and expertise for new solution development, both from within solution lines and connected across our business.\nFor example, our Health Solutions team has developed an Aon health analytics platform, supported by hundreds of data scientists and credential health actuaries, as well as experts from human capital and ad business services. It's designed to help clients assess and improve their employees' health, which in turn helps deliver well-being, productivity and lower cost.\nWithin this offering, driven by proprietary analytics, we can assess data around employee health information, insurance and claims, workplace safety, absence engagement data and external data on health trends and solutions, which together form a robust view of employee physical well-being.\nWith this insight, our teams can recommend individualized solutions, including better insurance offerings and targeted program. As an example, 1 manufacturing client wanted to improve employee physical well-being and reduce costs. Together, we designed a comprehensive long-term well-being strategy and a customized health program that includes 12 vendors and targeted specific health and well-being programs for employees based on individual factors correlated success. The results were impressive.\nIn our target group as compared to nonparticipants, we saw meaningful improvement in selected health metrics at 24% lower cost per person. Further, the platform allows for rapid scale and distribution of a solution to help our clients drive workforce health, wealth and productivity.\nEqually important, our colleagues while having this kind of impact, which is an important driver of our very high Aon colleague engagement. And we see examples like this across the firm every day as we help our clients manage risk and support their people. And this demonstrates the opportunity to continue delivering innovative solutions at scale to address our clients' biggest challenges across the backdrop of rapid change and ongoing volatility.\nTo summarize, we began 2023 in a position of strength. Our firm is more connected than ever before, enabling us to deliver better solutions for clients and to better support our colleagues. Aon United will continue to deliver results now and over the long term for our clients, colleagues and shareholders and is reflected in our progress to achieve key financial objectives.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress in Q4 and 2022 and our long-term outlook. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Aon Plc\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter of performance across our key metrics to finish the year.\nIn the quarter, we translated 5% organic revenue growth into 40 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2022, organic revenue growth was 6%. Adjusted operating margins increased 70 basis points to 30.8%, and we generated over $3 billion in free cash flow, an all-time high. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into 2023.\nAs I reflect on results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. We continue to expect mid-single digital greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 2% in both Q4 and the full year includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 4% in both periods. Primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies.\nI'd also highlight that fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth, was $41 million in Q4 and $76 million for the full year or 1% in both periods.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.2% an increase of 40 basis points driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E.\nFor the full year, adjusted operating margin of 30.8% reflects margin expansion of 70 basis points year-over-year. And I'll note over the past 12 years, we delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion a year.\nLooking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year, driven by 3 areas: the first is top line revenue growth. The second is this portfolio mix shift to higher margin businesses as we invest disproportionately in areas of increasing client demand, supported by data-driven solutions to deliver the insights and advice that help our clients protect and grow their organizations. And third area is increased operating leverage from ongoing productivity improvement from our Aon Business Services platform.\nI'd highlight that Aon Business Services continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a high inflationary market. Our Am business services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale.\nDuring 2022, we continue to make progress on Aon Business Services and driving efficiencies in enhanced services. Particularly through process improvement, automation and the use of artificial intelligence. For instance, our captives business has clients with hundreds of legal entities who each require multiple policies. Previously, the process of checking policies was manual and inefficient. We've now moved to a digital solution that can identify differences quickly and accurately and deliver these to clients much more quickly.\nSimilarly, the use of AI is increasingly enabling us to deliver better solutions to clients. For example, we delivered a new solution for our human capital clients using an AI-powered search engine that provides them with insights on technology talent globally including geography-based pay differentials. This is essential for finding the best technology talent and optimizing within the client's existing workforce, a key area of growth for many firms.\nAs we've said before, these improvements not only improve accuracy and client service delivery, they also help free up our colleagues time for more valuable client activities and drive better outcomes for our clients.\nOrganic growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS of 5% in Q4 and double-digit growth of 12% for the full year. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.09 per share in Q4 and $0.44 per share for the full year 2022. If currencies are remained stable at today's rate, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.13 per share in the first quarter of 2023 and $0.12 per share for the full year 2023.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. We generated over $3 billion in free cash flow in 2022, contributing to our long-term track record of growing free cash flow at 13% CAGR since 2010. Our outlook for free cash flow in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements.\nI'd note CapEx returned to a more normalized level in 2022 as we made ongoing investments in ABS enabled platforms and technology to drive long-term growth. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments, on a disciplined return on capital basis.\nGiven our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately $675 million of share repurchases in the quarter and $3.2 billion of share repurchase for the full year.\nWe also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs. We've invested in expertise and content to help meet our clients' needs such as our Q4 acquisition of ERM, a Mexico-based leader in risk assessment modeling, which expands our catastrophe modeling and consulting capabilities in reinsurance.\nOur M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. We ended 2022 with an ROIC of 30.6%, an increase of nearly 1,900 basis points over the last 12 years.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA growth over the long term while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. With respect to interest rates, I'd note our term debt is all fixed rate, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. I'd note our pension liability improved as interest rates increase.\nAs a continuation of our pension derisking efforts, I'd highlight that we completed an annuity settlement transaction in the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $300 million reduction in our pension benefit obligation. This continues to be an incredibly attractive environment for our clients to do pension risk transfers, and we continue to see very strong demand from clients. We've done substantial numbers of pension risk transfers in the U.S. and the U.K. and are a leader in the space.\nIn summary, 2022 was another year of strong top and bottom line performance, driven by the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services. We returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. The success we achieved this year continues to provide momentum as we head into 2023. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2023.\nOverall, our business is resilient and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to the Aon plc's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated.\nInformation concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nWe begin by thanking our Aon colleagues for delivering another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. Our recently concluded all-colleague engagement survey reinforces the resilience and commitment of our team as we continue to receive and benefit from exceptional colleague feedback with overall engagement, ways of working and brand strength all at 80% or greater.\nMore than ever, colleagues understand the power of our Aon United strategy and have embraced the smart working approach we developed to preserve flexibility in how and where we work, while enabling them to be better connected and more capable of helping clients make better decisions to support their businesses.\nThe importance of the support and the exceptional nature of our response is illustrated by our recently released executive risk survey and the tremendous leadership of our team on Hurricane Ian. Taken together, these 2 data points reinforce the relevance and return on our Aon United strategy.\nFirst, our 2022 executive risk survey, which surveyed 800 C-suite executives from global companies, underscores the volatility facing leading organizations and offers a window into their mindset and needs. A majority survey, 79%, the increased volatility on the horizon, but only 1/3, just 35% feel fully prepared to manage the impact of that volatility.\nMost important, those that feel very prepared share 3 fundamental leadership attributes that reinforce the relevance of our capabilities. First, they see embracing risk as a source of potential competitive advantage. [62%] of very prepared leaders agree that their company's appetite for risk has increased in response to the current economic conditions.\nSecond, they're willing to invest in new approaches to address emerging risks. These leaders focus on long-tail risks and call out concerns around disruptive categories like cyber and supply chain.\nAnd third, they value expert insight and are looking for partners to help them make better business decisions. Prepared leaders are nearly twice as likely to look to counsel from an external adviser that can provide a more holistic enterprise perspective on decisions to protect and grow their businesses.\nAnd all these survey findings reinforce the relevance of our strategy. Hurricane Ian highlighted an excellent example of that value in action.\nTo begin, we want to extend our deepest sympathies to those impacted by this event. In these times of challenge, as communities endure the tragic loss of life and tremendous damage, we believe that our actions as a firm can help businesses and communities respond and recover. As always, our team took a holistic Aon United view towards serving our clients before, during and after the event.\nPre-event, we used our resource development models to ensure that our 1,800 commercial risk claims colleagues around the world were prepared to respond to a surge in client need. This was a collaborative global effort, possible only because of our mindset and single P&L approach.\nIn addition, we are able to use impact forecasting models from our Reinsurance team to game out potential hurricane [paths] and share those insights with our commercial risk colleagues, so they could alert the clients to potential exposures, allowing for early activation of business continuity plans.\nDuring the event, we provided real-time insight on actual harm by leveraging satellite and drone imagery provided through technology partnerships, enabled by our Aon Business Services team. This is another example of how our emphasis on technology-driven innovation is reshaping client service at scale.\nPost event, we obviously focused on accelerating claims resolution. But we're also stepping back with clients and taking an enterprise view of what the hurricane means for the benefit plans, leveraging our Health Solutions team and beginning new conversations around how they think about return to work, exploring how our Human Capital solutions colleagues can apply learnings from our own smart working strategy to their workforce management.\nThis is Aon United in action and only possible because of the decade-plus investment we've made to break down barriers across our business and build Aon Business Services into an engine that provides us the insights and scale necessary to meet client needs.\nTurning to performance. In the third quarter, our colleagues delivered excellent results, demonstrating continued momentum and year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics. For Q3, organic revenue growth was 5% on top of 12% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 16%. These results are consistent with our full year ongoing financial guidance, and we would note that Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter for revenue.\nYear-to-date, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points, adjusted EPS growth of 14% and generated over $2 billion of free cash flow.\nTurning to solution lines. Commercial Risk delivered 5% organic revenue growth this quarter on top of 13% in the prior-year quarter, contributed 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date, driven by ongoing strong retention, new business generation and renewals, highlighting the resilience of our core business as we continue to help clients protect and grow their businesses.\nAs we previously mentioned, the significant increase in M&A volume impacted our Transaction Solutions business, especially compared to last year's result, which was particularly strong in Q3 and Q4.\nReinsurance delivered 7% organic revenue growth in the quarter, was 7% year-to-date as our team continues to help clients in the current market, while bringing new solutions and capabilities.\nFor instance, our newly established Strategy and Technology Group provides our clients with strategic advice, data-driven consulting, analytics and modeling tools and has further strengthened the capability we gained through our acquisition of Tyche. This is all [this] time in driving growth, efficiency and resilience have never been more important.\nHealth Solutions delivered 5% organic revenue growth in Q3 on top of 16% in the prior-year quarter, contributed to 8% year-to-date growth, with particularly strong growth in Human Capital Solutions. Across Health, we see clients assessing their people strategies to optimize for workforce skill and organizational structure while making sure those employees feel valued and engaged.\nFinally, Wealth Solutions delivered 2% organic growth on top of 4% in Q3 last year and 2% year-to-date as our team continues to help clients address market volatility, talk about regulatory challenges and execute ongoing pension risk transfers.\nIn two exciting milestones, our team has advised over $200 billion of pension risk transfer transactions in the U.S. and U.K. as pension plans continue to derisk and take advantage of market conditions. And we reached the $1 billion mark in planned assets and commitments for our pooled employer plans, which helps cover and helps lower cost and enhance retirement security for employees at smaller organizations.\nOverall, our strong performance in Q3 and year-to-date reflects the strength of Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform, delivered for clients across regions and solution lines. For the full year, we remain confident in our commitment to mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth.\nAs our clients assess the impact of increased economic volatility on their businesses, many are looking to improve their own working capital and liquidity, often by accessing new sources of capital.\nIn one recent example, an Aon United example, our client, based in Asia, was awarded a multibillion-dollar construction contract in Latin America for a manufacturing facility that incorporates innovative carbon reduction technologies. The client had a regulatory and contractual requirement that they provide a financial performance guarantees, essentially drawing on their own credit facility.\nTo address, our local commercial risk team, who has a deep understanding of our clients' strategy and financial position, collaborated closely with our local credit experts in LatAm to design a bespoke surety bond solution for our client. Rather than using a bank guarantee facility, our client was able to access capital at a lower cost and more attractive terms while maintaining their own balance sheet strength and flexibility.\nJust as we've done with [intellectual] property lending, and pension risk transfer solutions, this is another example of how we help clients access new capital to reduce risk and drive their own growth [adjustments].\nIn summary, we delivered a strong quarter of top and bottom line results, contributing to our year-to-date progress against key metrics. We continue to be strongly positioned to deliver on our full-year financial commitments of mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth.\nWe see increasing opportunity to help our clients. And the steps we've taken to operationalize the Aon United and our Aon Business Services platform gives us confidence in our ability to address our clients' existing and emerging needs that they continue to protect and grow their businesses.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance in the quarter and year-to-date as well as our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Aon Plc\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone.\nAs Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress on our key financial metrics for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share and generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into the last quarter of 2022.\nAs I reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5% in the third quarter and 7% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2022 and over the long term.\nI would also note that flat reported revenue growth in Q3 and 3% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 5% for Q3 and 4% year-to-date, primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies.\nAnd I'd highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth calculation, was $26 million in Q3 and $35 million year-to-date.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first 9 months of the year with adjusted operating margins of 30%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E.\nLooking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis.\nAs we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of a full year, and we expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing reduction of T&E as well as ongoing investments in long-term growth like technology throughout the year.\nAon Business Services is a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a highly inflationary market. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale.\nLet me share one fantastic example of how Aon Business Services platform supports ongoing improvement as we automate day-to-day processes around the firm. Reinsurance has operated on a single global broking platform and client service model since 2017.\nOver the past 5 years, the team has digitized processes, automated workflows and moved work to low-cost locations. 64% of transactions are now processed digitally, increasing speed and accuracy, which has helped reduce the average number of days it takes to get claims from carriers paid to our clients by 22% from 38 to 30 days.\nIncreasing capacity enabled 27% more throughput, while costs were up just 9% over 5 years, a particularly impressive outcome when considering recent cost and wage inflation trends. And the platform enables the team to provide enhanced services while dealing with more complex transactions, an Aon United outcome that allows our colleagues to better support each other and our clients.\nWe continue to find and capture efficiency opportunities like this around the firm and expect Aon Business Services will continue to be a driver of ongoing efficiency improvements, quality and service improvements and increased innovation for clients.\nWe translated strong operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 16% in Q3 and 14% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 per share in Q3 and $0.34 per share year-to-date. If currency is to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.11 per share or approximately $33 million decrease in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 79% year-to-date to $2.051 billion, reflecting an increase in cash flow from operations due primarily to the $1 billion termination fee payment in the prior-year period. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And I'd note, Q4 is our seasonally strongest for free cash flow generation.\nWe continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements.\nGiven our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately 1.2 billion of share repurchase in the quarter and 2.5 billion year-to-date.\nWe also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. We've invested in expertise and content in our Retirement business, where we're helping clients navigate regulatory changes such as GMP in the U.K. and utilizing higher interest rates to drive record levels of pension risk transfers.\nOur M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We'll continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on a return on capital balance basis.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes in Q3. And as we've said before, we'll continue to add debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.\nWith respect to interest rates, I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.8% and a weighted average maturity to be approximately 12 years. I'd also note that our pension liability improves as interest rates increase. And historically, we've taken steps to derisk this liability and reduce volatility.\nIn summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2022. Overall, our business is resilient, and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nWe begin by expressing our deepest appreciation for our colleagues. Their extraordinary dedication to delivering results for clients, bringing the best of Aon across geographies and solution lines, is inspiring. And their passion and commitment are reflected in the highest-ever colleague engagement recorded in our latest full survey.\nIn the second quarter, our colleagues delivered excellent results, demonstrating continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue growth was 8% in Q2 and year-to-date, on top of 11% in prior year quarter, consistent with our ongoing financial guidance of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth.\nThis top line strength translated into an adjusted operating margin of 26.2% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from last year, and adjusted EPS growth of 15%, demonstrating the strength of our Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform.\nTurning to revenue. Commercial Risk delivered 7% organic revenue growth, driven by ongoing strong retention and renewals, highlighting the strength of our core business and strength from areas of investment like CoverWallet within digital client solutions. In addition, external trends, select inflation continue to be an opportunity for us to help ensure clients are covered for increased exposure.\nReinsurance delivered 9% organic revenue growth in a dynamic renewal market. Our team brought the full capability of our firm's data, analytics and expertise, resulting in strong retention and net new business generation.\nHealth Solutions delivered 11% organic revenue growth, with strong growth in core health and benefits driven by client demand, increasing health care costs and continued growth in advisory work related to regulatory changes, well-being and resilience.\nWithin Human Capital Solutions, demand remains very high to support clients with advice and solutions, especially as they manage ongoing return-to-work plans, a highly competitive talent market, wage inflation and employee well-being.\nFinally, Wealth Solutions delivered 3% organic growth as our teams continued to deliver results in core retirement and investment solutions, with ongoing additional work to help clients address regulatory changes and impact from recent market conditions, like the opportunity for pension risk transfer.\nAcross Wealth and Health, external factors are increasing client costs, making it more important than ever for them to efficiently provide optimal benefits for their employees.\nOverall, our strong performance in Q2 and year-to-date reflects the strength of our core business across regions and solution lines. While there is uncertainty around external economic factors, some of the trends that challenge the broader economy are positive for our business and create opportunities to health plans.\nFor the full year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver results in each of our 3 financial commitments: Mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth.\nOn the topic of innovation, among many categories of investment, we'd like to highlight 2 areas where clients are demanding new or better solutions, and we are making meaningful progress in serving them.\nIntellectual Property and Climate. On IP, our Intellectual Property Solutions team is delivering a first-of-its-kind solution that enables entrepreneurs to fund IP-rich start-up growth businesses without giving up ownership using debt that is backed by insured IP assets.\nQ2 marked an exciting milestone as the team crossed the $1 billion threshold in IP-backed insurance and Aon's debt financing. Let me highlight one recent opportunity where out team supported a high-growth technology hardware company.\nGiven the company's business model and growth stage, we've had multiple funding avenues available. The company chose this solution to meet its growth capital needs, minimizing equity dilution.\nThe $100 million transaction allowed the company to secure its financing for growth, while insurance markets were able to derisk high-risk schools with an innovative application to an intangible asset class. Going forward, we're making progress to increase the number of lenders and insurance carriers participating in that solution as we build client awareness, accelerate distribution and continue to scale this business.\nOne additional note, as current and evolving economic conditions make impressive equity-driven valuations, IP-backed debt provides a potential new option for start-up growth clients to protect equity ownership and forgo potential down-round funding.\nOn Climate, our team is working on many initiatives. Today, we will highlight 2. Aon's work on Aon and our work supporting renewable energy investment. We'll start with our progress on Aon's journey to Zero Carbon. In March of 2021, we made an industry-leading commitment to be net zero by 2030, in alignment with science-based targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\nWe're pleased to report that we've made great progress so far and reduced our 2021 carbon emissions 12% from our 2019 baseline, as we decarbonized our supply chain, reduced our real estate footprint with smaller greener space and reduced travel, in part with the impact of COVID-19. Our recent ESG impact report details our commitment and actions on climate as well as our ESG topics, which are embedded in our overall strategy.\nFor our clients, this comes down to helping them understand and quantify their climate risk. We prepare to communicate and report on this risk and do something about it by building resiliency, positioning lower carbon and investing in transition. Given our track record of underwriting new risks and developing proprietary valuation models, paired with our climate analytics, data and partnerships, we're very well positioned to our clients' quantify current and potential future risks, which we can then help them mitigate and transfer.\nFor example, in Renewable Energy alone, onshore and offshore wind investment exceeds $70 billion today and could grow to nearly $400 billion by 2030, another rapidly growing addressable market that we serve with meaningful solutions today to ensure the construction and ongoing operation of these facilities.\nSimilarly, in solar, there is $45 billion of investment today in construction, manufacturing and technology development. And we expect this investment to grow to over $100 billion by 2025. Recently, our team facilitated a placement for one of the world's largest solar farms, required in Aon United Equity across Commercial Risk and Reinsurance to obtain coverage despite challenging market conditions. As these renewable energy projects continue to grow in size, scale and complexity, the need for expertise and innovation in existing technologies will only increase.\nFurther innovation in areas like carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and other new technologies will require even more innovation to enable the risk financing necessary to make these projects more economically attractive. Our ability to reduce risks of new solutions helps bring in new investment and ultimately helps enable continued moves toward decarbonization.\nIn summary, we delivered a strong quarter, demonstrating continued operating momentum and progress in our key financial metrics. Our Aon United strategy and operating model, supported by Aon Business Services, places us in a very strong position to support our clients as they face changing economic conditions.\nIn addition, our colleague engagement is very high as our team delivers on a strategy that enables us to achieve results today, both in the core and in priority growth areas, while also investing in innovative new client solutions like intellectual property and climate.\nFinally, our strong performance in Q2 and year-to-date reinforces our commitment to achieving our financial objectives for the year.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Aon Plc\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress in both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first half of the year, we translated 8% organic revenue growth into 50 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2022, as I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year.\nAs Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 8% in both Q2 and year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth for full year 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that reported revenue growth of 3% in Q2 and 4% year-to-date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX, primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies and fiduciary investment income of $7 million in Q2 and $9 million year-to-date.\nFurther, I note we are uniquely well positioned with respect to current economic conditions. Inflation increases insured values, which has a positive impact on our business, and we've continued to see modest tailwinds from insurance pricing, which remains strong. Interest rate increases benefit costs through fiduciary investment income and reduced pension liabilities.\nBroadly, as Greg mentioned, volatility makes the solutions and advice we offer around risk and people even more valuable to our clients, for instance, in areas like workforce resilience and pension derisking.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first half of the year, with adjusted operating margins of 32.7%, an increase of 50 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from our Aon Business Services platform; overcoming expense growth, which includes investment in colleagues, technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis.\nAs we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year. And we expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing reduction of T&E throughout the year. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a high inflationary markets. While our Aon Business Services platform continues to enhance our ability to scale innovation and unlock growth opportunities, it also supports continuous improvement as we automate day-to-day processes around the firm.\nFor instance, our Aon Business Services and commercial risk teams saw automation opportunities specific to insurance. We're now using automation to locate, extract and validate the data, rather than manually pulling it from e-mails and attachments. Over the years, this will save our North American team 83,000 work hours, representing a 30% reduction in total time spent processing service requests with certificates of insurance before further enhancements.\nWe're delivering high-quality client service and enabling our colleagues to spend more time on higher value-added activities and improving colleague engagement. Our Aon Business Services platform enables us to find and capture efficiency opportunities like this around the firm and remains a key driver of ongoing efficiency improvements and margin expansion. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 15% in Q2 and 14% year-to-date.\nAs noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.10 per share in Q2 and $0.29 per share year-to-date. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.11 per share in the second half or approximately $0.04 in Q3 and $0.07 in Q4 of 2022.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow decreased 17% year-to-date to $1,063 million, primarily driven by higher receivables as well as higher incentive compensation payments given our strong 2021 financial results as we described in Q1, offset by strong operating income growth. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally stronger than the first half. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022.\nLooking forward, we continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvement. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by approximately $500 million of share repurchase in the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date.\nWe can also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solution to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. As we've said before, we'll continue to add debt as EBITDA grows, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.\nThinking about interest rates. I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate with an average interest rate of approximately 3.8% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. I'd also note that our pension liability improves as interest rate increase. And historically, we've taken steps to derisk this liability and reduce volatility.\nIn summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year-to-date demonstrate continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2022. Overall, our business is resilient, and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect at this time.\nIt is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nWe'd like to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our colleagues across the firm. They continue to exhibit remarkable leadership, supporting clients in a challenging environment. We also want to thank our colleagues for their inspiring support of our team, their families and others who have been impacted by the Russian war in Ukraine.\nThis is a tragic example of increasing global volatility, adding to the challenges that face organizations and individuals every day, including continued effects of COVID-19, especially in Asia; inflation; climate change; capital availability; and connected impact to supply chains, intellectual property, workforce resilience and retirement readiness. In this environment, helping our clients protect and grow their businesses, support their employees, their communities and their stakeholders has never been more important.\nTurning to financial performance. Our team delivered an excellent first quarter and start to the year with 8% organic revenue growth, an increase from a strong prior year performance of 6% in Q1 2021. This top line strength translated to a 38% adjusted operating margin, an increase of 60 basis points and 13% adjusted EPS growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon Business Services platform to drive sustainable margin expansion as well as support growth.\nWithin our solution lines, we would highlight in Commercial Risk, we delivered 9% organic revenue growth, with growth in every major geography and particular strength across renewals and retention. Our teams are working incredibly hard to make sure our clients have the right coverage that fully considers the impact of inflation and other economic factors.\nReinsurance Solutions organic revenue grew 7%, driven by continued strength in retention and new business generation around the world as we help clients navigate a complicated and challenging risk environment. In Health Solutions, organic revenue grew 8%, reflecting global strength in core health and benefits and advisory work, especially around well-being and resilience.\nWe also saw double-digit growth in Consumer Benefit Solutions and Human Capital. And we would note particular strength in our rewards and corporate governance and ESG practices as we see our clients increasingly focus on talent, compensation and risks and opportunities related to ESG.\nAnd finally, Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth was flat in the quarter. Our retirement investments team continues to do excellent work, helping our clients address ongoing opportunities as well as regulatory changes and challenges. Priority development areas like delegated investment management and growth in pooled employer plans were a highlight in the quarter.\nLooking ahead and fully recognizing increasing uncertainty in global complexity, for the full year 2022 and over the long term, we continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth. We also continue to expect margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022 and over the long term.\nAs we reflect on the strong combination of organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter and our expectations for the year, we would highlight that our Aon Business Services platform is becoming an increasingly powerful tool for client service and growth in addition to driving ongoing efficiency gains.\nFor example, in recent discussions with a multinational chemical company, our Aon Business Services client dashboard changed the game on how we interact with them on their M&A growth strategy. Comprehensive data sets easily acceptable to our team enabled them to bring insights around the value of the client's intellectual property as a driver of their priority M&A activity. This created great value for them and opened up substantial opportunities for us in many areas, including transactional liability and intellectual property solutions. More simply, these analytics help us identify innovative opportunities and where we might be underpenetrated today by geography or by solution lines.\nIn another example, Aon Business Services is equally powerful supporting our work with clients in ESG, an increasingly wide-ranging topic for our clients. Our ESG practice with the human capital solutions specializes in assessing and prioritizing risks and opportunities for our clients across their stakeholder base and their business.\nOur ESG risk assessment tool allows clients to monitor key risks in real time and is focused on specific client priorities given their business, geography, industry and competitive landscape. The tool links those risks to Aon insights, experts and solutions to drive sustainability, model their climate risk, better navigate the D&O or cyber landscape and reinforce their culture to strengthen their people strategy. And specifically on environmental risk, we're using our proprietary climate analytics to quantify the impacts of climate change on our clients' physical assets, which then helps inform risk mitigation and improve resilience.\nThe power of this capability is not just in developing innovative solutions, with the ways in which it helps colleagues better inform and advise our clients, it's also in our ability to connect and scale distribution of these solutions across the firm, including in our acquisitions where we bring an expertise with the express intent to scale new capabilities.\nIn the latest example, we recently announced the acquisition of a U.K.-based technology company, Tyche, and we're delighted to welcome our new colleagues to Aon. The actuarial software platform they've built enhances our balance sheet modeling capability, especially in reserving and pricing, and allows us to enhance our analytics offering to a broad base of reinsurance clients and commercial risk clients with complex balance sheets.\nTyche's differentiator is to strengthen speed of simulations, enabling our teams to model complex risks transparently, to help our clients better understand both risk and meet evolving regulatory requirements. Scaling the formidable capability that Tyche brings reinforces our broader strategy by enhancing our analytical tools and actuarial modeling capabilities. This will enable us to advise and execute across the insurance industry with clients and help them meet their goals of ongoing growth, capital management, and ultimately, economic returns.\nIn summary, our strong first quarter results reinforce continuing momentum and position us well to deliver on our key metrics over the full year. While we continue to anticipate the volatility of all kinds and its impact on organizations will continue to grow, in this environment, our Aon United strategy and Business Services platform both become more relevant. The capability and track record that we've built gives us confidence in our ability to drive further value for our clients, colleagues, society and shareholders.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance and long-term outlook.\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Aon Plc\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter to start the year, highlighted by 8% organic revenue growth that translated into 60 basis points of margin expansion and double-digit growth in earnings per share. We look forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2022.\nAs I reflect on the quarter, first, organic revenue growth was 8% driven by strong ongoing retention and net new business generation. I would note that total revenue growth of 4% includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX, driven primarily by a weaker euro versus the dollar as Q1 is our seasonally largest quarter for euro-denominated revenues. As we look to the rest of 2022, we're continuing to monitor various macroeconomic factors, including the underlying drivers of GDP, inflation and interest rates, which all impact our clients and our business.\nIn particular, I would note a few interrelated impacts. On GDP, we've noted there's a correlation between our revenue and GDP growth, particularly the underlying drivers of GDP, such as asset values, corporate revenues and employment levels. We've recently seen decreases in global GDP growth forecasts for the year driven by the factors such as ongoing impacts of COVID-related restrictions, the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and expected increases in interest rates.\nAs we've communicated previously, our revenue base is very resilient. An impact from GDP tends to shovel the more discretionary portions of our business, such as project-related work across the portfolio. These portions of our business were strong in Q1, though, as Greg mentioned, we're seeing increased uncertainty in overall trends.\nI would also note there are many ways in which we can help clients in times of challenging economic circumstances or increased volatility. On inflation, we see impacts to our revenue and expense base. On revenue, inflation increases underlying exposures across our business, for instance, in property value and health care costs. As Greg mentioned, we're working with our clients to ensure they're appropriately protected against these increasing values and optimizing their total cost of risk.\nOn expenses, we're continuing to invest in our colleagues and are hiring to support growth, especially in priority areas. This does increase overall compensation costs, although Aon Business Services strategy continues to drive efficiency in operations and support our goal of ongoing margin expansion.\nAnd on interest rates, there are puts and takes at play. But generally, we are very well positioned for higher interest rates. While revenue in some areas of our business like construction and transaction liability is often dependent on client investment behavior, which may be impacted by rising interest rates, I would highlight 3 main points on how we benefit from higher interest rates.\nFirst, we see investment income increases as short-term interest rates rise. Over the course of the year, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, such as the U.S. federal funds rate and ECB deposit facility rate, translates to an impact of about $60 million in total revenue and operating income.\nSecond, our pension liability improves as increases in interest rates result in higher discount rates used to value our pension obligations. Third, our term debt is all fixed rate with an average rate of 3.8%. So the interest expense associated with our existing term debt does not increase.\nOverall, our business is resilient, and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. As Greg said, we do see increased external volatility. However, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for 2022 and over the long term.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 38%, an increase of 60 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from our Aon Business Services platform, overcoming a negative impact of FX and expense growth, which includes investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some resumption of T&E.\nAs we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year. We expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing resumption of T&E throughout the year. We expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis.\nWe translated strong adjusted operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 13% for the quarter. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 per share in the quarter. If currency remains stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.08 per share or approximately $24 million decrease in operating income in the second quarter of 2022.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow decreased 17% to $440 million, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation payouts given our strong 2021 financial results. I would note that we had strong growth in the prior year period and that Q1 has historically been our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint due primarily to incentive compensation payments. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2022.\nLooking forward, we expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, driven by operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today even at all-time highs, highlighted by approximately $800 million of share repurchases in the first quarter.\nWe also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client need, as we've done with Tyche. Our M&A pipeline is focused on our high-priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. As we've said in the past, we continue to assess all capital allocation decisions and manage our portfolio on a return-on-capital basis.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q1, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes. We estimate our leverage ratios to be within the range expected for our current investment-grade credit ratings. As we've said before, we'll continue to evaluate the opportunity to add debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.\nIn summary, our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance, driven by our Aon United strategy. We start the year in a position of strength and expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and drive shareholder value creation.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as having been posted on our website.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. You may begin.\n\nGregory Clarence Case\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Aon Plc\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.\nOur strong performance in 2021 is the direct result of deliberate steps we've taken that are enabling us to win more, do more and retain more with clients. We're driving top and bottom line results and are exceptionally well positioned to continue to deliver ongoing performance in 2022 and over the long term. Most important, we want to express deep gratitude to our Aon colleagues around the world for their performance and results this year and for everything they've done for clients and for each other.\nOur colleagues delivered a fantastic Q4 and a very strong finish to an outstanding year. We achieved organic revenue growth of 10% in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in Commercial Risk and Reinsurance, driven by net new business generation and client retention.\nIn commercial risk, we saw strength across the world. driven by net new business and retention in the core. We also saw strength in more discretionary areas of the portfolio as economic growth and client activity continued to increase, including double-digit growth in project-related work and in transaction solutions as our teams responded to M&A deal flow and increased client demand.\nWithin Health and Wealth Solutions, we saw double-digit growth in priority areas that we've been disproportionately investing in, in the last several years, including voluntary benefits and health solutions and in delegated investment management and Wealth Solutions, which remains an essential part of our portfolio.\nOur full year organic revenue growth of 9% reflects the strength and momentum of our Aon United strategy, which is designed to drive top and bottom line results. To that point, operating income increased 17% year-over-year; full year operating margins expanded 160 basis points to 30.1%, with margin of 32.8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing efficiency improvements, net of investment and long-term growth; earnings per share increased 22% for the full year; free cash flow exceeded $2 billion; and we completed $3.5 billion of share buyback in 2021, a strong indication of our confidence in the long-term value of the firm.\nLooking forward to 2022 and beyond, we continue to expect mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth. Looking back on the year, we would offer 3 observations that drove performance in '21 and reinforce our continued strong momentum in 2022.\nFirst, as complexity and uncertainty has increased around the world, clients are demanding a partner capable of providing them greater clarity and confidence to make better decisions that will protect and grow their businesses. In 2021, organizations and individuals continue to face the ongoing challenges of COVID and resulting effects in supply chain, growing concerns over climate change, [financial] property, retirement readiness, regulatory changes, cyber and workforce resilience. Against that backdrop, our decade-plus focus on Aon United and the content capability it allows us to deliver has never been more relevant.\nSecond, our colleagues feel that relevance and they take great pride in our ability to deliver existing and new sources of value to clients. They recognize that these external challenges facing our clients create opportunity for them to bring better solutions and grow professionally. We know this is what engages our colleagues and why they're feeling more relevant, more connected and more value. And we're seeing the impact of this focus. In our recent all-colleague survey, engagement levels remain at all-time highs, in line with top quartile employers. Ultimately, we know that by creating an exceptional colleague experience or ensuring a better client experience, both of which translate into better performance for the firm.\nAnd third, we continue to accelerate our innovation strategy by using our Aon United operating model to replicate successful solutions and applying those capabilities to new client bases, paving the way for innovation at scale. We're incorporating our data, analytics and insight to direct existing capabilities to previously unmet client needs. This allows us to serve existing clients in new and customized ways, bring existing solutions to new clients and expand our addressable market. Let me highlight a few examples that demonstrate how we scale innovation to help our clients, both in new ways and from new sources.\nHistorically, you heard us talk about Aon Client Treaty, pre-underwritten insurance capacity we established at Lloyd's, that we used to up our clients more easily and efficiently access capital for their placements. When we designed this program over 5 years ago, we analyzed every historic placement, quantify the risk parameters around business replacement on Lloyd's and then prearrange capital to back those risks. Aon Client Treaty provides more efficient access to capital for clients and insurers, and we see ongoing opportunity to apply this concept to different geographies and risk classes using the same proprietary data and analytics backbone supported by Aon Business Services.\nOne new offering driving directly from this capability is a solution that team design called [Morilla], which enables reinsurers and investors to invest across our global reinsurance client portfolio. This provides a broad entry point into global reinsurance risk that benefits our clients by enabling capital to access markets more efficiently. This first-of-its-kind solution could not have been designed without a proprietary analytic capability, and we see important opportunities to build on this platform for future growth across Aon.\nAnother example to highlight is within voluntary benefits, where we're developing innovative solutions at scale and driving double-digit growth. The offering combines user insight around enrollment from our active health care exchanges and capabilities from acquisitions like Univers and Farmington. Our analytics platform and dashboards assess and illustrate planned features, product usage, claims experience and overall plant performance, providing insight into employee demand and satisfaction. This work is [informed] by 20 years of enrollment data from over 4 million participants, which enables us to rapidly develop the spoke solutions for our clients that strengthen their total rewards offering and reinforce their human capital strategy at a time when this has never been more essential.\nThese examples demonstrate how we help our clients access capital end markets in ways that never existed before. Within that backdrop of increasing and changing risk, we're not only bringing our clients better solutions, we're also working more closely with them to understand their biggest challenges, which in turn guides further innovation.\nOur focus on building innovative capabilities that scale across Aon to better meet our clients' needs is also highlighted by our recent appointment of [Gillian Sleifield] as our Chief innovation Officer. Gillian's digital experience and deep connections with Aon and across the industry position her exceptionally well to ensure that we're rapidly distributing new solutions to clients.\nTo summarize, 2021 was a year of incredible performance and a year that positions us for growth, innovation and momentum for 2022. As we look forward, this momentum is further reinforced by global economic and societal trends and the resulting challenges and opportunities for our clients, which means that our Aon United strategy becomes even more relevant as we help clients make better decisions to protect and grow their businesses. The capability and track record that we've built gives us confidence in our ability to drive further value for our clients, colleagues, society and shareholders.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress in Q4 and 2021 and our long-term outlook. Christa?\n\nChrista Davies\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Aon Plc\n\nThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter of performance across our key metrics to finish the year. In the quarter, we delivered 10% organic revenue growth, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, which translated into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth, continuing our momentum as we head into 2022.\nAs I reflect on full year results, first, organic revenue growth was 9%, including double-digit growth in Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that total revenue growth of 10% includes a modest favorable impact from change in FX, partially offset by the impact of certain divestitures completed within the year, most notably, the retiree health Care exchange (inaudible), as we continue to shift our portfolio towards our highest growth and return opportunities.\nAs we look to 2022, we're continuing to monitor various macroeconomic factors, including the underlying drivers of GDP; asset values, corporate revenues and employment; inflation; government stimulus; and the impacts of COVID variants, all of which impact our clients and our business. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for 2022 and over the long term.\nMoving to operating performance. We delivered substantial operational improvement with adjusted operating income growth of 17% and adjusted operating margin expansion of 160 basis points to a record 30.1% margin. The investments we have made in Aon Business Services got further confidence in our ability to expand margins, building on our track record of approximately 100 basis points average annual margin expansion over the last decade. We previously described the repatterning expenses that incurred within 2021, which have no impact on year-over-year margins. While certain expenses may move from quarter-to-quarter, we do not expect further repatterning. We expect the 2021 expense patterning to be the right quarterly patterning going forward before an expense growth.\nDuring the year, as we previously communicated, we saw revenue growth outpaced expense growth and investments. While we do expect expenses to increase in 2022, due to certain factors such as increased investments in colleagues and a modest reduction of T&E, we think about growing margins over the course of the full year. We expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis.\nWe translated strong adjusted operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EBS growth of 22% for the full year, building on our track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the last decade. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter and was a favorable impact of roughly $0.23 per share for the full year. If currency remains stable at today's rate, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.16 per share or approximately $48 million decrease in operating income in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn addition, we expect noncash pension expense of approximately $11 million for full year 2022 based on current assumptions. This compares to the $21 million of noncash pension income recognized in 2021.\nTurning to free cash flow and capital allocation. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services. In 2021, free cash flow decreased 23% to $2 billion, reflecting strong revenue growth, margin expansion and improvements in working capital, which were offset by $1 billion termination fee payment and other related costs. I'd observe that excluding the $1 billion termination fee payment, free cash flow grew $400 million or approximately 15% from $2.6 billion in 2020.\nOur outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond remains strong. Given this outlook, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation as we believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately $2 billion of share repurchase in the quarter and $3.5 billion of share repurchase in 2021. Over the last decade, we've repurchased over 1/3 of our total shares outstanding on a net basis.\nIn 2022, we expect to return to more normalized levels of CapEx as we invest in technology and smart working. We expect an investment of $180 million to $200 million. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined return on capital basis. We also expect to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our M&A pipeline is focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We continue to assess all capital allocation decisions and manage our portfolio on a return on capital basis. We ended 2021 with a return on capital of 27.4%, an increase of more than 1,500 basis points over the last decade.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In addition, we issued $500 million of senior notes in Q4. As we said before, growth in EBITDA, combined with improvement in our year-end pension and lease liability balances, increases the capacity we have issue incremental debt while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. Our net unfunded -- funded pension balance improved by nearly $500 million in 2021, reflecting continued progress and a result of the steps we've taken over the last decade to derisk this liability and reduce volatility.\nThis reduction in volatility is significant for many of our clients who still have pension obligations on their balance sheet. Current market conditions and funding status are giving many clients a chance to reduce the risk of future volatility related to funding status or regulatory changes. Our retirement team's insight and analytics in this space can help our clients access new capital to efficiently reduce their risk, often with a partial pension risk transfer, creating a long-term opportunity for us to help our clients manage their balance sheet risk effectively.\nIn summary, 2021 was another year of strong top and bottom line performance, driven by the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services. We returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2021. The success we achieved this year provides continued momentum as we head into 2022. We believe our disciplined approach to return on invested capital combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth will unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."

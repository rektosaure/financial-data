As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcasted without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Moran, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Mr. Moran, you may begin.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nGood morning, and welcome. Today, we'll discuss Baxter's third quarter 2025 results, along with an update to our full year 2025 outlook and newly issued fourth quarter 2025 guidance. This morning, a press release was issued with our preliminary earnings results and updated outlook. The press release and investor presentation are available on the Investors section of the Baxter website.\nJoining me today are Andrew Hider, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025 and matters related to future dividend declaration, the anticipated impact of the Kidney Care sale, including our ability to eliminate related costs, the anticipated impact of various regulatory and operational matters, including ones related to our infusion pump platform, what we believe to be continuing fluid conservation and heightened inventory levels and commentary regarding the global macroeconomic environment, including tariffs and proposed mitigating actions.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release, the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our investor presentation and our SEC filings for more details.\nIn addition, please note that on today's call, all our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release and in our investor presentation. Finally, as a reminder, continuing operations excludes Baxter's Kidney Care business, which is now reported as discontinued operations.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew P. Hider\n\nCEO & Director, ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Let me welcome you officially as the new Head of Baxter's Investor Relations team, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be here for my first earnings call as CEO and look forward to getting to know everyone here better as the quarters progress.\nAs I've said in many settings over the last several weeks, it is an honor to have the responsibility to lead this new chapter at Baxter. Our company is essential to health care with an iconic brand that is valued and trusted by caregivers and patients globally. Since joining the company, I've immersed myself in Baxter's business, leading teams around the world, 14 site visits across 7 countries and counting, working side-by-side with employees, speaking directly with customers and gaining a more detailed view of the opportunities and challenges we face. I have learned a great deal in a short period, but I want to reflect on two things that clearly stand out.\nFirst, is that we are building from a fundamental position of opportunity. I have been struck by the commitment and pride this team brings to Baxter's mission to save and sustain lives and to serving our customers. This is a business whose portfolio has proven resilient over its almost 100-year history, one that has delivered significant revenues and attractive operating margins and generated solid cash flow over the years. The strength of our business, the critical role we play in health care and the talent and dedication of our people who are committed to win should position us well to deliver lasting value.\nSecond is that we are proactive and clear-eyed about what needs to improve and change at the company, so we're better positioned to deliver on our potential. Let me be clear about that. We are not satisfied with our current performance. There is a recognition that challenges must be met head on with both immediate actions as well as real long-term solutions. I'm also very realistic about the road in front of us as we work to prioritize our areas of focus, improve execution and business performance, deliver sustained growth and improve profitability and cash flows.\nTurning briefly to this quarter's results, which Joel will speak to in detail. Our third quarter top line performance came in lower than our previously issued guidance and exceeded expectations on the bottom line due to a favorable tax rate. These results reflect challenges in 2 divisions: the Infusion Therapies and Technologies division within the Medical Products & Therapy segment and the Injectables and Anesthesia division within the Pharmaceuticals segment.\nImportantly, Baxter's Healthcare Systems and Technology segment demonstrated improved performance. Before I turn it to Joel to discuss financial results in more detail, I want to give you a better sense of how I'm approaching the first several months of my time at Baxter and to give you some context on the decisions and actions that we have taken to date and will take in the coming months. We will have more opportunities to discuss long-term strategy down the road. But in the near term, you will see us take actions and decisions designed to support three areas: first, stabilizing the areas of the business that require increased focus; second, strengthening our balance sheet; and third, driving a culture of continuous improvement and enterprise-wide efficiency.\nLet me share my initial thoughts on each. I'll start with stabilizing the business. Baxter already has undergone significant transformation in recent years and is now a more streamlined and focused enterprise. But of course, there have been challenges in certain areas that have hampered growth and consistent execution, and we expect our growth algorithm to continue to be pressured in the near term. With my background in operations, I am bringing a keen eye to people, process and performance of Baxter, along with what we call uniform value creators, standardized metrics that we are focused on value creation. One critical area of focus and attention right now, for example, is related to the pause we've taken on deliveries and installations of the Novum IQ large volume pump. While we're disappointed that we expect the current hold to remain in place beyond year-end, we are working tirelessly to evaluate and test potential corrections to fully resolve the flow rate issues.\nIn parallel, we will continue to closely support current Novum IQ LVP users. We will also continue to offer Baxter's Spectrum IQ LVP, a long-standing and well-known product used in more than 1,500 facilities across the U.S. and Canada as a leading option for infusion therapy, one that Baxter continues to invest in. The Spectrum IQ LVP now operates on a shared gateway with Novum IQ syringe, creating a cohesive user experience and is built for the future with EMR interoperability, enhanced software and innovative analytical capabilities. A second area of focus will be improving Baxter's balance sheet. It is from the basis of a strong balance sheet that we will be better able to invest in the business, support innovation and deliver and return increased value to our shareholders. This means focusing on improved cash flow and taking a consistent approach to our capital allocation objective.\nThe first step in addressing our balance sheet is taking decisive and clear steps to reduce our leverage. It is in this context that we and the Board intend to reduce the quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid in January 2026. This will free up cash to accelerate de-leveraging, consistent with our prior commitments. Joel will provide more details on that in his section of the call as well. The last area you will continue to see us prioritize is building enterprise efficiency into everything we do at Baxter. Earlier this month, we rolled out Baxter GPS, our new growth and performance system aimed at driving continuous improvement and a growth and performance mindset. This data-driven system is inspired by best-in-class models from organizations known for strong cultures of continuous improvement and represents a positive change in how we work, but also adapts in real time, helping to ensure we are moving toward greater efficiency, stronger performance and impact. Ultimately, this will help build the habits and discipline across the enterprise that will define our future success. I've led this type of system successfully at several other companies, and I'm confident it will lead to improved performance of Baxter over the long term.\nIn closing, I want to step back and reflect on what makes me confident and excited about Baxter's future. Yes, there is work ahead, and the coming quarters will require significant focus, discipline and execution. But I see a company with a strong foundation, a clear path forward and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities. You can expect us to work with urgency and focus to accelerate growth, improve margins and cash flow and drive enhanced innovation.\nWe are on a journey to build a better Baxter that is more resilient, more agile and more capable than ever, at Baxter with a more consistent execution, what I like to call a higher say-do ratio, a Baxter that will work to redefine health care delivery and in doing so, continue to deliver meaningful impact for customers, patients and long-term value creation for shareholders. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress and getting to know you all better in the coming weeks and months. With that, I will now turn it over to Joel. Joel, over to you.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Let me also take a moment to welcome Kevin Moran as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Many of you already know Kevin from his prior IR roles at other companies in the space. Kevin brings valuable finance, IR and importantly, healthcare experience to the team. We're excited to have Kevin on the team and look forward to his leadership in continuing to strengthen our relationships with you all.\nBefore I begin the sales discussion, a reminder that results discussed on today's call will reference operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, MSA revenues from Vantiv and the previously announced exit of IV Solutions from China.\nThird quarter 2025 global sales from continuing operations totaled $2.8 billion and increased 5% on a reported basis and 2% on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter reflects growth across nearly all divisions. On the bottom line, total company adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.69 per share. Results in the quarter reflect positive pricing in select segments, receipt of Kidney Care TSA income and lower nonoperating expenses, including interest and tax.\nNow I'll walk you through results by reportable segment. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth on an operational basis. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT segment were $1.3 billion and declined 1% in the quarter. Performance in the quarter reflects softness in Infusion Therapies and Technologies or ITT, slightly offset by strong demand for advanced surgery products. Within MPT, third quarter sales from our IPT division totaled $1 billion and declined 4%, primarily reflecting lower infusion pump sales due to the previously discussed ship and installation hold of Novum LVP and ongoing softness in U.S. Hospital IV Solutions, which we believe is due to continuing post-hurricane Helene fluid conservation efforts. Sales decline in Infusion Systems includes lost sales, Novum LVP customer turns and certain customers electing to transition to our Spectrum IQ LVP. We expect sales across our infusion pump portfolio to remain under pressure as we work with our customers to complete the necessary corrections to fully address the outstanding field actions and lift the shipment and installation hold on Novum.\nWhile we see continued interest in our pump portfolio, we recognize that the timing and nature of the resolution of the Novum LVP hold is leading some customers to evaluate alternative solutions. We are actively supporting Novum customers with both initial and eventually additional corrections as well as offering Spectrum IQ as an alternative. We remain focused on minimizing disruption and maintaining strong relationships across our installed base. Within IV Solutions, U.S. demand remains below pre-hurricane han levels. Based on our current expectations, we expect further recovery in demand, though at a more moderate pace and some level of fluid conservation is likely to remain in 2026.\nOver the medium and longer term, we remain confident in the strength of our IV Solutions business. Sales in Advanced Surgery totaled $306 million and grew 11% globally. Results in the quarter reflect solid demand for our portfolio of hemostats and sealants, strong commercial execution across all regions and steady procedure volumes. MPT's adjusted operating margin totaled 20.5% for the quarter, increasing 50 basis points over the prior year period and reflecting positive pricing in the quarter, partially offset by lower sales volumes and increased manufacturing and supply costs resulting from the factors previously discussed.\nR&D expense declined in the quarter, primarily due to onetime items, while underlying investment remained unchanged. Kidney Care TSA income contributed to positive performance in the quarter as well. In Healthcare Systems and Technologies or HST, sales in the quarter totaled $773 million, increasing 2%. Within HST, sales of our Care and Connectivity Solutions or CCS division were $473 million and grew 3% globally. Performance in the quarter was driven by 4% growth in the U.S. for CCS, reflecting double-digit growth in our Surgical Solutions business and continued momentum across our Patient Support Systems and Care Communications portfolios. Total U.S. capital orders for CCS increased 30% compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based strength across patient support systems, care communications and surgical solutions. We continue to believe our order pipeline remains strong.\nTo date, we have not observed a slowdown in U.S. hospital capital spending. However, given the broader macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to closely monitor the situation. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $300 million and increased 1%. Performance in the quarter reflects increased demand in our cardiology portfolio. HSC adjusted operating margin totaled 13.5% for the quarter, decreasing 450 basis points compared to the prior year. These results reflect higher costs related to tariffs, increased R&D investments and increased corporate allocation expenses following the sale of Kidney Care. TSA income partially offset these increased expenses.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceuticals segment. Sales in the quarter totaled $632 million, increasing 7%. Within Pharmaceuticals, sales of our Injectables and Anesthesia division were $333 million and grew 3% globally. Performance in the quarter reflects high single-digit growth in our anesthesia portfolio, driven by increased volumes in certain markets outside the U.S. Injectables growth benefited from a favorable comparison to the prior year period, which was negatively impacted by the timing of certain sales and supply constraints impacting international sales. We continue to experience softness in certain premix products, largely consistent with the dynamics discussed last quarter related to IV infusion protocols and increased use of IV push in select hospital settings.\nOur teams remain focused on reinforcing the clinical value of our premix portfolio and driving improved commercial execution.\nDrug compounding grew 11% and reflects strong demand for our services outside the U.S. Pharmaceuticals adjusted operating margin totaled 8.9% for the quarter, decreasing 100 basis points compared to the prior year. These results reflect the unfavorable product mix, increased procurement costs and increased corporate allocation expenses. These expenses were partially offset by Kidney Care TSA income.\nFinally, other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly to certain manufacturing facilities were $16 million in the quarter. MSA revenue from Vantiv totaled $85 million. As a reminder, these sales are included in our reported growth. However, they are not reflected in our operational growth for the quarter.\nBefore moving on to the rest of the P&L, an important reminder on our continuing operations reporting. Following the sale of the Kidney Care business, certain corporate costs that did not convey with the business are now allocated across our segments in both cost of goods sold and SG&A, along with income from the TSAs, which is currently recognized within other operating income. In addition, as previously discussed, we reclassified certain functional expenses from SG&A to cost of goods sold beginning earlier this year. These costs support manufacturing and are now treated as indirect expenses, subject to inventory capitalization and recognized in cost of sales when sold. Therefore, as a result of these cost shifts across the P&L, we believe it is most appropriate to focus on operating income expansion. Importantly, operating margin on a continuing operations basis was 14.9% in the quarter, improving 40 basis points compared to the prior year period. Results reflect disciplined expense management and the benefit of TSA income, partially offset by softer volumes and mix.\nThird quarter adjusted gross margins from continuing operations were 39.4%, a decrease of 430 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline reflects the factors I just discussed. Third quarter adjusted SG&A from continuing operations totaled $629 million or 22.2% as a percentage of sales, a decrease of 240 basis points from the prior year period. Results reflect disciplined expense management and the benefit from the reclassification of functional costs. Adjusted R&D spending from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $115 million or 4.1% as a percentage of sales, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year period. Results reflect the timing of certain R&D expenses currently expected to shift into the fourth quarter and certain onetime items and therefore, do not reflect our anticipated level of R&D spend going forward.\nKidney Care TSA income and other reimbursements totaled $85 million in the quarter and came in line with our expectations. As previously discussed, the associated expenses related to this income are reflected in other lines of the P&L, including cost of goods sold and SG&A. Altogether, these factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 14.9% on a continuing operations basis, improving 40 basis points compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense from continuing operations totaled $58 million in the quarter, a decrease of $29 million versus the prior year period, reflecting lower interest expense following the paydown of existing debt with proceeds from the sale of Vantiv.\nAdjusted other nonoperating income totaled $7 million, reflecting lower losses from foreign currency translation compared to the prior period. The continuing operations adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 5.1%, driven primarily by the release of reserves withholding taxes and discrete benefits related to mix of earnings across jurisdictions. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.69 per share for the quarter and increased 41% versus the prior year.\nContributions to earnings growth included positive pricing, the receipt of Kidney Care TSA income as well as lower nonoperating expenses, including interest and tax. Before turning to our updated outlook, I want to comment on cash flow and liquidity.\nThird quarter free cash flow was $126 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to roughly flat. As we close out the year, we expect continued free cash flow generation in Q4. We remain focused on strengthening cash flow generation through improvement across all areas of working capital.\nAs Andrew mentioned, to prioritize and accelerate our de-leveraging, we anticipate reducing the quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share beginning with the next payment scheduled to be made in January of 2026. This action is expected to free up more than $300 million in annual cash flow. Given our year-to-date business challenges, we now expect to achieve our 3x net leverage target by the end of 2026. Once achieved, we will look to expand our aperture for capital deployment. We recognize the importance of improving our balance sheet and are continuing to prioritize de-leveraging in the near term, including with cash made available from the proposed reduction in our dividend.\nLet me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2025 outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2025, Baxter expects total sales growth of 4% to 5% on a reported basis. This guidance reflects current foreign exchange rates, which are expected to contribute approximately 50 basis points to top line growth for the year. In addition, our reported sales guidance includes the contribution of approximately $320 million of anticipated MSA revenues from Vantiv. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the MSA revenues and the exit of IV Solutions in China, Baxter now expects operational sales growth of 1% to 2% for 2025. This reflects a reduction from our prior expectations of 3% to 4% as we have updated our outlook to better reflect the evolving dynamics across select parts of the business.\nOperational sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows; For MPT, we now expect sales to be flat to 1%, reflecting the uncertainty around the Novum situation as discussed previously. We continue to expect sales in our HST segment to increase 3% to 4%. Performance reflects sustained momentum across the portfolio, supported by a healthy order pipeline and strong execution. We now expect Pharmaceuticals to increase approximately 2%, which reflects the continued softness in select premix products, which we continue to work through.\nTurning to our outlook for other P&L line items, beginning with tariffs, we continue to estimate the net impact to our results is approximately $40 million in 2025. TSA income and other reimbursements are expected to range between $170 million to $180 million. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin from continuing operations between 14.5% and 15%, which reflects the top line sales reduction and the associated impact on our integrated supply chain costs from lower volumes flowing through our manufacturing facilities. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total between $210 million to $220 million.\nOn a continuing operations basis, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our diluted share count to average approximately 515 million shares for the year. Based on all these factors, we have adjusted our outlook for full year adjusted earnings per share on a continuing operations basis to $2.35 to $2.40 per diluted share from the prior guidance of $2.42 to $2.52 per share. This reflects our updated adjusted operating margin and tax rate assumptions. Specific to the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect continuing operations sales growth of approximately 2% on a reported basis and declined approximately 2% on an operational basis.\nFor the fourth quarter, foreign exchange is expected to positively impact the top line by approximately 100 basis points and MSA revenues are expected to total approximately $80 million. Note that we have now mostly lapped the China IV Solutions exit and is not expected to have a meaningful impact to top line growth in the fourth quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.57.\nWith that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President -- Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Brent Shafer, Baxter's Chair and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Joel Grade, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Heather Knight, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2025 results, along with our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2025.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2025, the anticipated impact of our strategic actions, the potential impact of various regulatory and operational matters, including matters related to the Nova IQ large-volume pump and continuing fluid conservation in the global macroeconomic environment on our results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nAnd of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the company's investor presentation and available in our earnings release issued this morning, both of which are available on our website. As a reminder, continuing operations excludes Baxter's Kidney Care business, which is now reported as discontinued operations.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Brent. Brent?\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nThanks, Clare, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning's release, our second quarter performance for continuing operations met our previously issued guidance on both top and bottom line. Specifically, second quarter sales from continuing operations grew 4% on a reported basis and 1% on an operational basis with growth coming from all 3 segments. And on the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.59, increasing 28% over the prior year.\nThese results did come in at the low end of our guidance ranges, reflecting softness in demand for certain products within the Medical Products & Therapies and Pharmaceutical segments. Heather and Joel will walk through more details on these factors during their remarks.\nImportantly, with the sale of Vantive now complete, we have now created a more agile and focused business designed to deliver incremental value for all of our stakeholders. We expect to continue to identify opportunities to further advance our operational effectiveness and improve performance which will be a key focus area for our next CEO, Andrew Hider, I'll comment more on Andrew's appointment at the close of the call.\nWe are confident in our strategy and our future opportunities to accelerate innovation, growth and performance overall. We continue to build on the strength of our streamlined profile and to benefit from our portfolio of medically essential products. I also want to recognize our exceptional Baxter colleagues globally, united by our mission to save and sustain lives. I'm grateful for their dedication to our company and our stakeholders.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Heather and Joel, who will share details on individual segment results, financial performance and updated guidance. Heather?\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nThanks, Brent, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you this morning to discuss our second quarter results. I'm going to walk through our sales performance in the quarter, and then we'll hand it over to Joel to walk through performance across the rest of the P&L, along with our updated financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2025. Before I begin the sales discussion, I want to provide a reminder that results discussed on today's call will reference operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, MSA revenues from Vantive and the planned exit of IV solutions from China.\nSecond quarter 2025 global sales from continuing operations totaled $2.8 billion and increased 4% on a reported basis and 1% on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter reflected strength in drug compounding, advanced surgery and care and connectivity solutions, which offset declines in injectables and anesthesia, infusion therapies and technologies and frontline care.\nNow I'll walk through our results by reportable segment. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth on an operational basis. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT segment, were $1.3 billion and increased 1% in the quarter. Performance in the quarter reflected strong demand for advanced surgery products offset by softness in Infusion Therapies and Technologies or ITT. Within MPT, second quarter sales from our ITT division totaled $1 billion and declined 1%, primarily reflecting the previously discussed impact of hospital IV fluid conservation efforts and slightly lower U.S. patient admissions than previously anticipated.\nAs noted in the press release, we have removed allocations for all IV solutions manufactured at North Coast and are working closely with our customers regarding current practices. While we have started to see a slight improvement with hospitals reducing fluid conservation efforts, our current outlook built in potential downside risk, the conservation efforts don't materially improve in the second half of the year and U.S. patient admission levels remain consistent with the second quarter. We continue to believe that hospitals will return to historic practices over time.\nThe fundamentals of the business remains strong, and we continue to recapture business from existing customers and take on new customers following the recovery of North Cove. We are committed to maintaining the broadest and most comprehensive IV solutions portfolio offering in the market, which strongly resonate with our customers. Notably, last week, Vivian announced the expansion of its reserve program to include Baxter IV fluids through a strategic partnership to help ensure reliable access to these critical products during times of supply disruption. The Baxter program provides participating health care organization with dedicated on-demand inventory warehouse here in the U.S.\nStrength in infusion systems from the rollout of our Noble LVP infusion platform helped offset the impact from fluid conservation efforts. I do want to pause here and acknowledge our decision we made a couple of weeks ago. to address feedback that has been identified for our ongoing quality procedures and in careful consideration of customer insights. We communicated to our customers that we have decided to voluntarily and temporarily pause shipments and planned installations of the Novum LVP.\nDuring this temporary ship and install pause, our customers have been working with us as we incorporate their feedback into our process. We are focused on supporting our existing customers continued use of the device as they implement recommended actions from the recent Novum LVP correction. We remain confident in the Novum IQ infusion platform and its support of safe and connected infusion therapy while recognizing that real-world implementation always provides opportunities to learn, adapt and improve.\nWhile we are unable to currently commit to an exact timing for resuming shipment and installation for Novo IQ LVPs, our goal is to reduce both as soon as possible this year depending on the progress we make with the related corrections and feedback from our customers. We are handling the situation with our mission in mind and with the utmost priority speed and care. We will continue to work in partnership with our customers and in alignment with regulatory agencies.\nSales in Advanced Surgery totaled $296 million and grew 5% globally. Results in the quarter reflected solid demand for our portfolio of hemostats and sealants, strong commercial execution across geographies and the steady procedure volumes. In Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST, sales in the quarter were above expectations and totaled $767 million, increasing 2%. The Growth in the quarter reflected continued strong sales in the Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS, division, increasing 4% to $474 million with a noted improvement internationally where sales rose 7%.\nUS CCS sales increased 3% in the quarter, driven by strength in care communications and surgical solutions. Total U.S. capital orders for CCS declined in the second quarter, primarily due to a difficult comparison to the prior year period where U.S. capital orders rose 40%, which included a large contract win. To date, we have not observed a slowdown in U.S. hospital capital spending. However, given the broader macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to closely monitor the situation. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $293 million and declined 1% compared to the prior year, but increased mid-single digits sequentially. Performance in the quarter reflected a high single-digit decline internationally driven by softness in select markets outside the U.S.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Sales in the quarter totaled $612 million, increasing 1%. Second quarter sales within injectables and anesthesia were $332 million and declined 4%. Performance in the quarter reflected a 1% decline in our injectables portfolio, driven in part by a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of a U.S. government order. We have also experienced some softness in demand for select premix products within our U.S. injectables portfolio. We attribute a portion of the softness in demand to follow-on impacts related to the hurricane which caused some hospitals to evaluate IV infusion protocols, including utilizing IV push and Lou of premix products in certain situations.\nOur commercial teams are working with customers to reinforce the clinical benefit and value proposition of premix injectables, while also continuing to execute on our new product launches. Lower sales of inhaled anesthesia continued to weigh on performance and declined low double digits in the quarter globally. Drug compounding grew 7% and reflected strong demand for our services outside the U.S. And other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily includes sales of products and services provided directly through certain manufacturing facilities were $13 million in the quarter. During the quarter, MSA revenue from Vantive totaled $98 million. As a reminder, these sales are included in our reported growth, however, are not reflected in our operational growth for the quarter.\nNow I'll pass it to Joel who will discuss performance on the rest of the P&L, along with our updated financial outlook. Joel?\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks today with some additional commentary regarding the P&L profile for the second quarter before turning to our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. Second quarter adjusted gross margins from continuing operations were 14.7%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline primarily reflected the impact from the Vantive MSA, lower manufacturing volumes drive these solutions and an unfavorable product mix.\nAs a reminder, starting in the first quarter, we reclassified certain functional expenses to cost of goods sold from SG&A following the completion of the sale of our Kidney Care business. These functional costs were previously recorded in SG&A and support manufacturing and are now classified as indirect costs subject to inventory capitalization and recorded in cost of sales was sold.\nSecond quarter adjusted SG&A from continuing operations totaled $639 million or $22.7 million as a percentage of sales. a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year period. Results in the quarter reflect continued investments in sales and marketing efforts and a headwind related to certain employee benefit-related costs. These costs were offset by the benefits from the reclassification of functional costs and continued disciplined expense management focused on mitigating the stranded cost impact.\nAdjusted R&D spending from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $134 million and represented $4.8 million as a percentage of sales, consistent with the prior year period. We continue to make targeted investments focused on advancing our new product portfolio and bringing customer-focused innovation to patients across our segments. TSA income and other reimbursements totaled $52 million in the quarter. This came in higher than anticipated and reflected increased levels of support for Vantive.\nAs previously discussed, the associated expenses related to this income are reflected in other lines of the P&L, including cost of goods sold and SG&A. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin at 15.1% on a continuing operations basis, improving 180 basis points compared to the prior year period. Operating margin in the quarter reflects the lower gross margin due to the factors just mentioned, offset by continued focus on operational execution as well as the benefit of TSA income and other reimbursements from Vantive.\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Baxter International's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President -- Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nTaking a look at adjusted operating margin by each reportable segment. MPT's adjusted operating margin totaled 18.1% for the quarter, increasing 10 basis points over the prior year period and reflecting positive pricing in the quarter, partially offset by the sales and manufacturing impact related to reduced fluid volumes associated with demand softness due to the factors we've discussed. R&D investments also increased in the quarter.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Brent Shafer, Baxter's Chair and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Joel Grade, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Heather Knight, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2025 results, along with our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2025.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2025, the anticipated impact of our strategic actions, the potential impact of various regulatory and operational matters, including matters related to the Nova IQ large-volume pump and continuing fluid conservation in the global macroeconomic environment on our results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nTSA income contributed to positive performance in the quarter as well. HFC adjusted operating margin increased sequentially and totaled 15.4% for the quarter, Margins declined 60 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting increased investments and higher corporate allocation expenses following the sale of Kidney Care. TSA income partially offset these increased expenses. Pharmaceuticals adjusted operating margin totaled 10.5% for the quarter. decreasing 200 basis points compared to the prior year. These results reflect an unfavorable product mix, increased investments and increased corporate allocation expenses. These expenses were partially offset by TSA income.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nAnd of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the company's investor presentation and available in our earnings release issued this morning, both of which are available on our website. As a reminder, continuing operations excludes Baxter's Kidney Care business, which is now reported as discontinued operations.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nNet interest expense from continuing operations totaled $58 million in the quarter a decrease of $28 million versus the prior year period, reflecting lower interest expense following the pay down of existing debt with proceeds to the sale of Vantive including the recent repayment of an outstanding European bond. Adjusted other nonoperating income expense was not meaningful in the quarter, compared to income of $24 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the impact of losses from foreign exchange balance sheet accounts recorded in the quarter.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Brent. Brent?\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nThanks, Clare, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning's release, our second quarter performance for continuing operations met our previously issued guidance on both top and bottom line. Specifically, second quarter sales from continuing operations grew 4% on a reported basis and 1% on an operational basis with growth coming from all 3 segments. And on the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.59, increasing 28% over the prior year.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThe continuing operations adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, decreasing 400 basis points over the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by benefits from the strategic use of select tax attributes as we continue to optimize our global structure following the sale of Kidney Care. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.59 per share for the quarter and increased 28% versus the prior year. Contribution to earnings growth include positive pricing, the receipt of TSA income and other reimbursements as well as the benefit of lower expenses from nonoperational items, including interest and tax.\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nThese results did come in at the low end of our guidance ranges, reflecting softness in demand for certain products within the Medical Products & Therapies and Pharmaceutical segments. Heather and Joel will walk through more details on these factors during their remarks.\nImportantly, with the sale of Vantive now complete, we have now created a more agile and focused business designed to deliver incremental value for all of our stakeholders. We expect to continue to identify opportunities to further advance our operational effectiveness and improve performance which will be a key focus area for our next CEO, Andrew Hider, I'll comment more on Andrew's appointment at the close of the call.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nBefore turning to our updated outlook, I want to briefly comment on our cash flows. On a year-to-date basis, we have incurred negative free cash flows of $144 million. Although during the second quarter, we generated $77 million of positive free cash flows. As a reminder, the first half of the year included certain Hurricane Helene related costs that were paid this year. We are intensely focused on improving our cash flow generation in the second half of the year. To achieve this objective, we are taking several actions with a key focus area being on our inventory management.\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nWe are confident in our strategy and our future opportunities to accelerate innovation, growth and performance overall. We continue to build on the strength of our streamlined profile and to benefit from our portfolio of medically essential products. I also want to recognize our exceptional Baxter colleagues globally, united by our mission to save and sustain lives. I'm grateful for their dedication to our company and our stakeholders.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Heather and Joel, who will share details on individual segment results, financial performance and updated guidance. Heather?\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nThanks, Brent, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you this morning to discuss our second quarter results. I'm going to walk through our sales performance in the quarter, and then we'll hand it over to Joel to walk through performance across the rest of the P&L, along with our updated financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2025. Before I begin the sales discussion, I want to provide a reminder that results discussed on today's call will reference operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, MSA revenues from Vantive and the planned exit of IV solutions from China.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nLet me conclude my remarks by discussing our 2025 outlook for the full year and the third quarter, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year Baxter expects total sales growth of 6% to 7% on a reported basis. This guidance reflects current foreign exchange rates, which are expected to contribute approximately 50 basis points to top line growth for the year. In addition, our reported sales guidance includes the contribution of approximately $320 million of anticipated MSA revenues from Vantive.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nSecond quarter 2025 global sales from continuing operations totaled $2.8 billion and increased 4% on a reported basis and 1% on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter reflected strength in drug compounding, advanced surgery and care and connectivity solutions, which offset declines in injectables and anesthesia, infusion therapies and technologies and frontline care.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange, the MSA revenues and the exit of IV solutions in China, Baxter now expects operational sales growth of 3% to 4% for 2025. This is a reduction from our prior expectations of 4% to 5%. So I'd like to take a moment to walk through some of the assumptions underpinning this updated outlook. While we never went to lower expectations, our overall objective is reducing the outlook was to capture more of the potential downside risks associated with some of the factors we've discussed today primarily around infusion pumps and fluid conservation.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nNow I'll walk through our results by reportable segment. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth on an operational basis. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT segment, were $1.3 billion and increased 1% in the quarter. Performance in the quarter reflected strong demand for advanced surgery products offset by softness in Infusion Therapies and Technologies or ITT. Within MPT, second quarter sales from our ITT division totaled $1 billion and declined 1%, primarily reflecting the previously discussed impact of hospital IV fluid conservation efforts and slightly lower U.S. patient admissions than previously anticipated.\nAs noted in the press release, we have removed allocations for all IV solutions manufactured at North Coast and are working closely with our customers regarding current practices. While we have started to see a slight improvement with hospitals reducing fluid conservation efforts, our current outlook built in potential downside risk, the conservation efforts don't materially improve in the second half of the year and U.S. patient admission levels remain consistent with the second quarter. We continue to believe that hospitals will return to historic practices over time.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nWith respect to the Novum infusion pump, as Heather mentioned, we have implemented a voluntary and temporary shift in implementation hold as we work through various updates for the Novum LVP. We are working closely with our customers, and our goal is to resume shipments as soon as possible this year, pending our review of the process for implementing related corrections. In addition, we offer customers the option of our Spectrum infusion pump as an alternative. The low end of our current guidance assumes we don't resume shipments for Novum prior to the end of the year.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nThe fundamentals of the business remains strong, and we continue to recapture business from existing customers and take on new customers following the recovery of North Cove. We are committed to maintaining the broadest and most comprehensive IV solutions portfolio offering in the market, which strongly resonate with our customers. Notably, last week, Vivian announced the expansion of its reserve program to include Baxter IV fluids through a strategic partnership to help ensure reliable access to these critical products during times of supply disruption. The Baxter program provides participating health care organization with dedicated on-demand inventory warehouse here in the U.S.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nWith respect to fluid conservation, our current expectation is that fluid conservation levels will begin to lessen over the course of 2025 and into 2026. At the low end of our guidance range assumes conservation levels remained similar to the first half of the year. Our teams continue to work closely with our customers to improve utilization as our supply levels have stabilized. At this time, we felt this was a prudent approach to take with respect to our sales guidance. We are hopeful that we can resume shipments of Novum prior to the year-end, and that fluid conservation levels will continue to improve. Our teams are working diligently and expeditiously to execute on these objectives. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we are committed to accelerating sales growth and advancing innovation to drive incremental value.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nStrength in infusion systems from the rollout of our Noble LVP infusion platform helped offset the impact from fluid conservation efforts. I do want to pause here and acknowledge our decision we made a couple of weeks ago. to address feedback that has been identified for our ongoing quality procedures and in careful consideration of customer insights. We communicated to our customers that we have decided to voluntarily and temporarily pause shipments and planned installations of the Novum LVP.\nDuring this temporary ship and install pause, our customers have been working with us as we incorporate their feedback into our process. We are focused on supporting our existing customers continued use of the device as they implement recommended actions from the recent Novum LVP correction. We remain confident in the Novum IQ infusion platform and its support of safe and connected infusion therapy while recognizing that real-world implementation always provides opportunities to learn, adapt and improve.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nOperational sales guidance for the full year by reportable segment is as follows. For MPT, we now expect sales to increase 3% to 4% and reflecting the impact of the factors just discussed. We now expect sales in our HST segment to increase 3% to 4%. We continue to be pleased with the building momentum we are experiencing in HST, but we'll continue to closely monitor the capital environment for any changes to hospital spending expectations. We now expect pharmaceuticals to increase approximately 4% to 5%, which reflects some of the softness we're experiencing in the U.S. for injectables. The teams are executing on the new product launches and working with customers to reinforce the benefits and value proposition of injectables. We are optimistic these actions will drive improvements over time.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nWhile we are unable to currently commit to an exact timing for resuming shipment and installation for Novo IQ LVPs, our goal is to reduce both as soon as possible this year depending on the progress we make with the related corrections and feedback from our customers. We are handling the situation with our mission in mind and with the utmost priority speed and care. We will continue to work in partnership with our customers and in alignment with regulatory agencies.\nSales in Advanced Surgery totaled $296 million and grew 5% globally. Results in the quarter reflected solid demand for our portfolio of hemostats and sealants, strong commercial execution across geographies and the steady procedure volumes. In Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST, sales in the quarter were above expectations and totaled $767 million, increasing 2%. The Growth in the quarter reflected continued strong sales in the Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS, division, increasing 4% to $474 million with a noted improvement internationally where sales rose 7%.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nBefore turning to our outlook for other P&L line items, I wanted to provide our latest thoughts regarding assumptions on the impact from tariffs. Given what has been announced to date, we now estimate the net impact to our results from tariffs is approximately $40 million in 2025, which is a reduction from our prior estimate of $60 million to $70 million. This remains a dynamic area. And as such, we will continue to evaluate adjustments to our supply chain network and targeted pricing actions in response to various shares impacts. Note these assumptions do not reflect any potential tariffs related to pharmaceutical products. As a reminder, the cash related costs for tariffs will be higher than the P&L impact due to the capitalization and associated rollout timing for these costs.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nUS CCS sales increased 3% in the quarter, driven by strength in care communications and surgical solutions. Total U.S. capital orders for CCS declined in the second quarter, primarily due to a difficult comparison to the prior year period where U.S. capital orders rose 40%, which included a large contract win. To date, we have not observed a slowdown in U.S. hospital capital spending. However, given the broader macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to closely monitor the situation. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $293 million and declined 1% compared to the prior year, but increased mid-single digits sequentially. Performance in the quarter reflected a high single-digit decline internationally driven by softness in select markets outside the U.S.\nMoving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Sales in the quarter totaled $612 million, increasing 1%. Second quarter sales within injectables and anesthesia were $332 million and declined 4%. Performance in the quarter reflected a 1% decline in our injectables portfolio, driven in part by a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of a U.S. government order. We have also experienced some softness in demand for select premix products within our U.S. injectables portfolio. We attribute a portion of the softness in demand to follow-on impacts related to the hurricane which caused some hospitals to evaluate IV infusion protocols, including utilizing IV push and Lou of premix products in certain situations.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nTSA income and other reimbursements are now expected to range between $170 million to $180 million. This increase reflects incremental services provided to Vantive with the related expenses reflected in the other lines of the P&L. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin from continuing operations between 15% to 16%, which reflects the top line sales reduction and the associated impact on our integrated supply chain costs from lower volumes flowing through our manufacturing facilities. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which included net interest expense and other income and expense to total between $210 million and $220 million.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nOur commercial teams are working with customers to reinforce the clinical benefit and value proposition of premix injectables, while also continuing to execute on our new product launches. Lower sales of inhaled anesthesia continued to weigh on performance and declined low double digits in the quarter globally. Drug compounding grew 7% and reflected strong demand for our services outside the U.S. And other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily includes sales of products and services provided directly through certain manufacturing facilities were $13 million in the quarter. During the quarter, MSA revenue from Vantive totaled $98 million. As a reminder, these sales are included in our reported growth, however, are not reflected in our operational growth for the quarter.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nOn a continuing operations basis, we now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 18% to 18.5%. We expect our diluted share count to average approximately 515 million shares for the year, which does not contemplate any share repurchases. Based on all these factors, we have adjusted our outlook for full year adjusted earnings on a continuing operations basis to $2.42 per share to $2.52 per diluted share from the prior guidance of $2.47 to $2.55 per share. This update reflects the impact from lowering our operating margin expectations, partially offset by a benefit from lower interest expense and tax rate assumptions.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nNow I'll pass it to Joel who will discuss performance on the rest of the P&L, along with our updated financial outlook. Joel?\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks today with some additional commentary regarding the P&L profile for the second quarter before turning to our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. Second quarter adjusted gross margins from continuing operations were 14.7%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline primarily reflected the impact from the Vantive MSA, lower manufacturing volumes drive these solutions and an unfavorable product mix.\nReturning to the third quarter of 2025. We expect continuing operations sales growth of approximately 6% to 7% on a reported basis and 3% to 4% on an operational basis. For the third quarter, foreign exchange is expected to positively impact the top line by approximately 100 basis points and MSA revenues are expected to total approximately $80 million. The China IV solutions exit is expected to impact top line growth by approximately 70 basis points in the third quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.62 per share.\nAs a reminder, starting in the first quarter, we reclassified certain functional expenses to cost of goods sold from SG&A following the completion of the sale of our Kidney Care business. These functional costs were previously recorded in SG&A and support manufacturing and are now classified as indirect costs subject to inventory capitalization and recorded in cost of sales was sold.\nSecond quarter adjusted SG&A from continuing operations totaled $639 million or $22.7 million as a percentage of sales. a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year period. Results in the quarter reflect continued investments in sales and marketing efforts and a headwind related to certain employee benefit-related costs. These costs were offset by the benefits from the reclassification of functional costs and continued disciplined expense management focused on mitigating the stranded cost impact.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Brent for some closing comments.\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nThank you, Joel, and thank you, Heather. As we look to the future, I want to share my thoughts on the recent news that Andrew Hider will join Baxter in the coming weeks as our next CEO. The Board led a comprehensive and thorough search and sought a range of experience in the candidates including the track record of value creation, innovation and transformation and the ability to drive quality and operational excellence. We determined that Andrew is the right leader for Baxter's next chapter to build on our rich history and nearly a century of leadership.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nAdjusted R&D spending from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $134 million and represented $4.8 million as a percentage of sales, consistent with the prior year period. We continue to make targeted investments focused on advancing our new product portfolio and bringing customer-focused innovation to patients across our segments. TSA income and other reimbursements totaled $52 million in the quarter. This came in higher than anticipated and reflected increased levels of support for Vantive.\nAs previously discussed, the associated expenses related to this income are reflected in other lines of the P&L, including cost of goods sold and SG&A. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin at 15.1% on a continuing operations basis, improving 180 basis points compared to the prior year period. Operating margin in the quarter reflects the lower gross margin due to the factors just mentioned, offset by continued focus on operational execution as well as the benefit of TSA income and other reimbursements from Vantive.\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nI've had the opportunity to spend time with Andrew during the process and since the announcement, and I directly observed his character deep respect for the Baxter brand and passion about our team, our culture and our mission to save and sustain lives. Andrew is a highly experienced public company CEO with a strong operational background. He will bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table from his 25 years of cross-industry experience. Throughout his career, he has consistently demonstrated an ability to advance innovation, drive growth deliver commercial success and create shareholder value. I can tell you that Andrew is very eager to join the Baxter team to make an impact and to meet many of you.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nTaking a look at adjusted operating margin by each reportable segment. MPT's adjusted operating margin totaled 18.1% for the quarter, increasing 10 basis points over the prior year period and reflecting positive pricing in the quarter, partially offset by the sales and manufacturing impact related to reduced fluid volumes associated with demand softness due to the factors we've discussed. R&D investments also increased in the quarter.\nTSA income contributed to positive performance in the quarter as well. HFC adjusted operating margin increased sequentially and totaled 15.4% for the quarter, Margins declined 60 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting increased investments and higher corporate allocation expenses following the sale of Kidney Care. TSA income partially offset these increased expenses. Pharmaceuticals adjusted operating margin totaled 10.5% for the quarter. decreasing 200 basis points compared to the prior year. These results reflect an unfavorable product mix, increased investments and increased corporate allocation expenses. These expenses were partially offset by TSA income.\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nFinally, I want to thank all of Baxter's 38,000 employees across the globe, our patients, customers and other stakeholders. It's been my great honor to serve as interim CEO for Baxter these last several months and I'm pleased to continue to serve the company as Chair of the Board of Directors following Andrew's official start date.\nWith that, we'll begin our question-and-answer session for the call."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Brent Shafer, Baxter's Chair and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Joel Grade, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Heather Knight, Baxter's Chief Operating Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter 2025 results, along with our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2025. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2025, the anticipated impact of our strategic actions, the potential impact of various regulatory and operational matters in the global macroeconomic environment, including new and proposed tariffs on our results of operations, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.\nPlease refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and available in our earnings release issued this morning, both of which are available on our website.\nAs a reminder, continuing operations excludes Baxter's Kidney Care business, which now reported as discontinued operations.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Brent. Brent?\n\nDavid Brent Shafer\n\nChairman & CEO, Cerner Corporation\n\nThanks, Clare, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our results for the first quarter reflect the building momentum of our strategic transformation journey and the hard work of our Baxter colleagues globally.\nAs you saw in this press release, our first quarter performance for continuing operations exceeded our previously issued guidance on both the top and bottom line. We're leveraging our verticalized operating model to create a more agile, focused product portfolio and advanced innovation to improve execution and drive profitable growth. First quarter sales from continuing operations grew 5% on a reported and operational basis. As a reminder, continuing operations exclude the impact of our Kidney Care business, which was acquired by Carlyle on January 31, 2025. Sales rose in all 3 of factors continuing segments with performance in Medical Products & Therapies and health care systems and technologies coming in ahead of expectations. Heather and Joel will share more on individual segment results later in the call.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.55. These results were fueled by top line performance, our continued emphasis on driving operational efficiency and a benefit from lower nonoperational expenses. We're pleased with our strong Q1 performance and confident in our strategic trajectory. At the same time, we're cognizant of the volatility that is present in the global macro and the resulting uncertainty that has been created in the marketplace. We, like others, are keenly focused on evaluating and working to address the impact of newly enacted global tariffs and future potential tariffs as well as a range of other interrelated factors.\nAs you're all aware, this remains an evolving and fluid situation. Joel will walk you through our key assumptions as they relate to our financial outlook for the remainder of this year and also how we plan to mitigate a portion of these impacts. To be clear, we remain positive about our opportunities to accelerate sales growth and expand margins. We continue to build on the strength of our operating model and the reinvigorated profile. And as always, we benefit from our durable portfolio of medically essential products, which has served as the underlying foundation of our strength for decades.\nFinally, I want to address the topic that I'm certain is on your mind, which is the identification of Baxter's next permanent CEO. While I'm not able to provide a detailed update, I can confirm that the search process is active and well underway, with the Board being assisted by a leading search firm in these efforts. As I shared previously, the Board is moving expeditiously but also deliberately to make sure we identify the right candidate to make the most of this opportunity to harness the potential our employees have helped create. We will, of course, keep our stakeholders updated on new developments as we are able to share them.\nIn closing, I want to recognize our global team for their dedication to our mission and outstanding contributions to Q1 performance.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Heather for a closer look at performance by segment.\n\nHeather Knight\n\nExecutive Vice President & COO\n\nThanks, Brent, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you this morning to discuss our first quarter results. I'm going to walk through our sales performance in the quarter, and then we'll hand it over to Joel to walk through performance across the rest of the P&L, along with our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2025.\nBefore I begin the sales discussion, I want to provide a reminder that results discussed on today's call will reference operational growth, which as stated last quarter when providing guidance excludes the impact of foreign exchange, MSA revenues from Vantive and the planned exit of IV solutions from China. As Brent referenced and as you've seen from our release, all 3 Baxter segments delivered year-over-year growth for the quarter at both reported and operational rates, helping fuel company-wide top line outperformance.\nFirst quarter 2025 global sales from continuing operations totaled $2.3 billion and increased 5% on both a reported basis and operational basis. This compared favorably to our previous guidance, which called for [indiscernible] 3% to 4% on a reported basis and approximately 4% on an operational basis. Our performance in the quarter was led by our HST segment with particular strength in our care and Connectivity Solutions division, along with better-than-expected sales in MPT.\nNow I'll walk through our results by reportable segments. Again, commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth on an operational basis at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products & Therapies, or MPT segment were $1.3 billion, increasing 6% in the quarter and came in ahead of expectations. Within MPT, first quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies and Technologies division totaled $994 million and increased 6%. Sales in the quarter benefited from double-digit growth for our U.S. infusion systems portfolio as the rollout of our Novum IQ pump platform continues. Nutrition sales in the quarter advanced mid-single digits globally, reflecting strong growth in the U.S. due to the continued progress we are experiencing and alternate sites for this business as well as improved supply for certain products that resulted in the clearance of back orders.\nWe also realized low single-digit growth for IV solutions. As we noted on the first quarter call, thanks to the team seller recovery efforts, production at our North Cove IV solutions facility is back to pre-hurricane levels following the impact of Hurricane lean. We are now focused on replenishing inventory and making continued progress on allocations for our customers. We expect to be off virtually all product allocations this month. IV solutions sales in the quarter reflected continued conservation of fluids at hospitals across the U.S. while the network fully recovers. Our current outlook reflects our expectation that hospitals will continue to conserve fluids in the near term but the utilization levels will improve, particularly as our allocations are removed and U.S. supply returns to normal levels.\nDuring the first quarter, we did see some distributors begin to rebuild their inventory levels, which helped to offset the impact from the conservation efforts. Our original expectation was that these rebuilds would likely occur more in the second quarter. Sales in Advanced Surgery totaled $268 million and grew 4% globally. Results in the quarter reflected solid growth outside the U.S. due to increased demand for our hemostat sealants and the timing of sales to distributors. Sales in the U.S. reflected 1 less billing day as compared to the prior year period. In addition, the prior year period reflected the benefit of a backorder clearance for one of our hemostat products.\nIn Healthcare Systems and Technologies, or HST, sales in the quarter were above expectations and totaled $704 million, increasing 6%. Within the HST segment, sales in the quarter for our Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS, division were $427 million, advancing 7% globally. Performance in the quarter was driven by 14% growth in the U.S. for CCS due to continued momentum in our Patient Support Systems or PSS business, which once again delivered strong growth and reflected a benefit from competitive wins in both our Med-Surg and ICU product lines as well as upgrades for existing customers. Total U.S. capital orders for CCS rose 20% in the quarter, creating a healthy backlog to support future growth for this division. To date, we have not seen a slowdown in U.S. capital hospital spending, but in light of the macroeconomic uncertainty, we are closely monitoring the situation. Our focus remains on highlighting the benefits of our broad portfolio and the enhanced digital capabilities we have added to improve workflow efficiency.\nPerformance for this division was partially offset by weaker sales outside the U.S. Importantly, we did see capital orders pick up internationally, and these are anticipated to contribute to growth over the course of the year. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $277 million and increased 5%. Performance in the quarter reflected a favorable comparison as well as continued signs of stabilization of the primary care market in the U.S.\nMoving to our Pharmaceuticals segment. Sales in the quarter totaled $581 million, increasing 3%. First quarter sales within injectables and anesthesia of $335 million grew 4%. Performance in the quarter reflected mid-single-digit growth in our specialty injectables portfolio driven by strong international growth, reflecting government order and increased demand. This performance was partially offset by lower sales of anesthesia in the quarter. Our expectation is that the anesthesia business will begin to stabilize and the rate of decline for this business will start to slow. Drug compounding grew 2% and reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year period. And in other sales to represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily includes sales of products and services provided directly through certain manufacturing facilities were $15 million in order.\nDuring the quarter, MSA revenue from Vantive totaled $63 million. These sales are not reflected in our operational growth but are included in our reported growth for the quarter.\nBefore turning it over to Joel, I want to take a step back. Looking holistically, our strength across the segment reflects both the power and the trajectory of our newly defined enterprise. Our confidence in our future potential remains high, and we are committed to executing on our strategic objectives even amid a more dynamic global macroeconomic environment. I'm confident we'll navigate this uncertainty just as we always do with the support of our 38,000 colleagues across the globe and with our mission to save and sustain lives, helping define our path forward.\nNow I'll pass it over to Joel, who will discuss performance down the rest of the P&L, along with our updated financial outlook. Joel?\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. As my colleague mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which came in ahead of our expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Before I begin, I want to highlight a point that both Brent and Heather referenced. As you're all aware, we now face more dynamic global macroeconomic environment, which has created a level of uncertainty for everyone, including our customers. We remain squarely focused on addressing the needs of our customers through our broad portfolio of medically essential products and evaluating opportunities to better optimize our supply chain network in light of new tariffs with some activities already underway. Importantly, we remain committed to accelerating our investments in innovation, focused on bringing products to the marketplace that solve the problems that our customers face and help redefine health care delivery. Importantly, we will not compromise on our efforts to thoughtfully accelerate innovation in targeted areas of the business as this is critical to support our future growth aspirations.\nStarting with the bottom line. First quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.55 per share and came in ahead of our prior guidance of $0.47 to $0.50 per share, driven by the favorable top line results, lower-than-expected SG&A expenses and a benefit from TSA income and other reimbursements. In addition, our tax rate and other nonoperational items came in favorable to our expectations, which more than offset a negative impact from foreign exchange. Before we're specifically addressing the rest of the P&L results, I want to make some comments regarding our continuing operations reporting. As a reminder, prior to the close of the Vantive deal, corporate costs that had previously been allocated in the Kidney Care segment that would not convey with the Kidney Care business in the sale were reported in unallocated corporate costs. Post close, these costs are now allocated to each of our segments, along with income from our transition services agreements, or TSAs, as well as cost containment initiatives the company is in the process of undertaking.\nOur goal remains to fully offset the impact of these training costs and [ lost ] the TSA income by the end of 2027. In addition, during the quarter, we reclassified certain functional expenses to cost of goods sold from SG&A following the completion of the sale of our Kidney Care business. These functional costs were previously recorded in SG&A and support manufacturing and are now classified as indirect costs, subject to inventory capitalization and recorded in cost of sales when sold. First quarter adjusted gross margin from continuing operations was 41.8%, a decrease of 160 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of MSA revenues from Vantive and higher expenses related to planning and fulfillment. First quarter adjusted SG&A from continuing operations totaled $608 million or 23.2 as a percentage of sales a decrease of 310 basis points from the prior year period. This year-over-year decrease reflects the benefit from the reclassification of functional costs, along with lower stock compensation expenses in the quarter and continued disciplined expense management.\nAdjusted R&D spending from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $138 million and represented 5.3 as a percentage of sales, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the prior year period. and reflect our continued investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and bringing innovation to patients across our segments. TSA income and other reimbursements totaled $40 million in the quarter. This came in higher than expected and reflected the increased levels of support currently required by Vantive. The associated expenses are reflected in other lines of the P&L. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 14.9% on a continuing operational basis, improving 260 basis points compared to the prior year period. This performance reflects continued focus on operational execution as well as the benefit of TSA income and other reimbursements from Vantive.\nTaking a look at adjusted operating margin by each reportable segment. MPC's adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 19.3%, increasing 80 basis points over the prior year period and reflecting positive pricing in the quarter, partially offset by elevated costs as we continue to improve volumes at North Cove and experience higher planning and fulfillment costs. TSA income contributed to positive performance in the quarter. HST first quarter adjusted operating margins of 13.2%, a 320 basis point improvement from the prior year, driven primarily by improved top line performance. TSA income also contributed to performance and helped to offset increased corporate allocation expenses. Pharmaceuticals adjusted operating margins were 10.8% for the quarter, decreasing 270 basis points compared to the prior year. These results reflect certain onetime expenses realized in the quarter and an increase in corporate allocations. These expenses were partially offset by TSA income.\nNet interest expense from continuing operations totaled $64 million in the quarter, a decrease of $14 million versus the prior year period, reflecting lower interest expense following the paydown of existing debt with proceeds from the sale of Vantive. Adjusted other nonoperating income totaled $17 million in the quarter compared to income of $9 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower losses from foreign exchange balance sheet accounts. The continuing operations adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 17.4%, benefiting from the strategic use of select tax attributes as we optimize our global structure following the sale of Kidney Care. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 per share for the quarter and increased 53% versus the prior year. Contribution to earnings included improved commercial performance positive pricing, the receipt of TSA income and other reimbursements as well as the benefit of lower expenses from nonoperational items, including interest and tax.\nLet me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the full year 2025 and the second quarter of 2025, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2025, Baxter expects total sales growth of 7% to 8% on a reported basis. This guidance reflects current foreign exchange rates, which are expected to minimally impact growth on the top line. This is an increase relative to our prior guidance which had assumed that foreign exchange would negatively impact sales by probably 200 basis points. In addition, our reported sales guidance includes the contribution of approximately $310 million of anticipated MSA revenues from Vantive, down slightly from our original expectations of $345 million. Operationally, Baxter continues to expect sales growth of 4% to 5%. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the impact of foreign exchange, MSA revenues and the planned exit of IV solutions in China. The negative impact from exiting the IV/solutions business in China continues to be approximately 50 basis points to growth.\nOperational sales guidance for the full year by reportable segment is as follows: For MPT, we continue to expect sales to increase approximately 5%, driven by strength in our Infusion Systems business positive pricing and other underlying business momentum. As mentioned earlier, we do expect IV solutions growth to improve as we remove allocations in some of the compensation [ efforts ]. This guidance excludes the impact of exiting the IV solutions market in China, which is estimated to impact sales growth by 100 basis points. We continue to expect sales in our HST segment to increase approximately 3%. While we are very pleased with the building momentum and healthy backlog we have built in HST, we will continue to closely monitor the capital environment for any changes to hospital spending expectations. We continue to expect pharmaceuticals to increase approximately 5% to 6%.\nBefore turning to our outlook for other P&L line items, I want to provide some thoughts regarding our assumptions around tariffs. Our updated guidance now includes the estimated impact from tariffs based on the current proposals enacted and assumes a reversion back to original proposed tariff rates following the 90-day suspension. In addition, our guidance does take into account that we are able to mitigate a portion of these impacts. In general, Baxter strives to make where we sell and buy where we make as part of our broader integrated supply chain approach. This allows us to deliver our products and solutions around the world with greater control and visibility to our operations. Currently, the majority of Baxter's products sold in the U.S. are manufactured in the U.S. and made largely from U.S. many components. However, international procurement is part of our business operations, and as such, we are impacted from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs that have been issued.\nWe plan to take several actions to help minimize the impacts related to tariffs. Some of these actions will be able to be realized more near term to help mitigate the impact in 2025 and others will require more time than implemented but will help offset the impact in future years. Some of these mitigation opportunities include: actively communicating lift and assessing our supplier base to identify risks and work to improve mitigations, which could include carrying additional inventory and identifying alternative suppliers or manufacturing locations. Identifying alternative shipping routes for suppliers and finished goods to help minimize the overall impact, assessing targeted pricing actions. And finally, continuing to work closely with our trade association partners in various countries to advocate for possible exemptions.\nTaking all this into account, we estimate the net impact to our results from tariffs is approximately [ $60 million ] to $70 million in 2025. Additionally, based on our standard rollout period, we expect to see the majority of the tariff's impact in the second half of the year. I'd note that while China represents a very small percentage of our total sales. Given the magnitude of the tariffs that have been enacted between these countries, these tariffs now account for nearly half of the total impact. At this time, our tariff assumptions do not reflect any potential tariffs related to pharmaceutical products.\nOne other item I'd like to highlight is that while current foreign exchange rates are expected to benefit top line relative to prior guidance, they do negatively impact our adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share, which is driven by our current infrastructure footprint that remains post the sale of Vantive. We have plans over time to optimize our global footprint. Inclusive of these factors and underlying business performance, we now expect full year adjusted operating margin from continuing operations between 16% to 16.5%. TSA income and other reimbursements are now expected to range between $140 million to $150 million. This increase reflects incremental services provided to Vantive with the related expenses reflected in the other lines of the P&L. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total between $220 million to $240 million.\nOn a continuing operations basis, we anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5%. We expect our diluted share count to average approximately 515 million shares for the year, which does not contemplate any share repurchases. Based on all these factors, we are increasing the low end of our prior guidance range and now anticipate full year adjusted earnings on a continuing operations basis of $2.47 to $2.55 per diluted share. Specific to the second quarter of 2025, we expect continuing operations sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% on a reported basis and 1% to 2% on an operational basis. For the second quarter, foreign exchange is expected to positively impact the top line by approximately 50 basis points, and MSA revenues are expected to total approximately $80 million. The China IV Solutions exit is expected to impact top line growth by approximately 70 basis points in the second quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.63.\nWith that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

We're continuing to move the company forward into a new era, and has recently announced that we closed the sale of Vantiv on January 31, 2025. This significant milestone was the final step of 3 strategic actions outlined in January of 2023 to transform the business. You'll recall these actions included the implementation of a new verticalized operating model. As a director and in my role as interim CEO, I can confirm that this segment-driven approach has created increased focus and execution related benefits, bringing greater clarity and agility to how we pursue opportunities globally. And as part of our transformation efforts, we completed the divestiture of Baxter's non-core biopharma solutions business in 2023.\nSince joining Baxter's Board in 2022, I've observed and supported these shifts in the company's strategic direction, and I'm extremely proud of the hard work and dedication of our teams to reach this stage. These actions have positioned Baxter to accelerate innovation for patients and customers and to drive profitable growth for our shareholders.\nLater in this call, Joel will provide details on our quarterly and full year performance as well as our outlook for 2025. As you have seen in this morning's release, we finished 2024 on a high note, meeting our fourth quarter guidance for continuing operations on both the top and bottom lines. And we're starting 2025, building on positive momentum.\nDuring this interim period, I'll be working closely with Heather, Joel and the rest of Baxter's strong leadership team to ensure we maintain that momentum. I've been very impressed by what I've experienced in the last few weeks, engaged, talented and highly motivated team that is squarely focused on Baxter's mission to save and sustain lives, a truly collaborative spirit and an intense focus on delivering on our commitments.\nThis includes initiatives focused on innovation and profitable growth to enhance performance, deliver increased value and to better serve the needs of our patients and customers. To support these efforts and as we've shared earlier this month, we've instituted a new Chief Operating Officer position as a next step in leveraging the potential of our vertical operating model.\nWe're fortunate to have Heather Knight step into this role as COO. Heather brings extensive experience and a proven track record to this position after a successful tenure as head of our largest segment, medical products and therapies, among other key leadership roles at Baxter and prior large health care companies.\nSo we leading day-to-day operations across our 3 segments, encompassing global commercial operations, R&D supply chain, medical and regulatory affairs. Her leadership will be critical as we navigate the next phase of growth.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Heather to share her perspective. Heather?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be joining today's call. I look forward to building upon what we've achieved to date and helping to launch a new chapter of accelerated performance for the company. As Brent mentioned, over the last 2 years, I've had the privilege of leading medical products and therapies, or MPT, which is back [ through ] the largest segment with over $5 billion in sales and operations spanning the globe.\nDuring this time, I spearheaded numerous vital initiatives with the support of my talented colleagues including the recent successful launch of our Novum IQ infusion pump platform in the United States. As the leader of NPT, I also helped oversee the North Cove recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene. Given the essential nature of the products that are manufactured in North Cove, we spared no expense in our efforts to help address product supply for patients and customers, including importing products from Baxter sites globally.\nThanks to the incredible dedication and resilience of the North Cove and broader Baxter teams, we were able to reach our production on 8 of the site's 10 manufacturing lines in the fourth quarter. Our final 2 manufacturing lines came online in January, and I'm very proud to report that we are now producing at pre-hurricane levels. This is just another critical milestone in our recovery as we continue to work to replenish inventory and support our customers and patients' needs. Additionally, I've served as the lead interface to many of our key customers and have been deeply involved and successfully renegotiating the recent renewals of select U.S. GPO contracts, helping to ensure we continue to meet our customers' needs while also delivering positive movement in pricing.\nAs COO, I'm excited to build upon my deep knowledge and understanding of our markets and operations to enhance collaboration across our segments and create a more holistic Baxter experience for our customers and the patients they serve. I'm confident that by harnessing our combined strength and expertise, we can unlock significant value and accelerate our efforts to drive customer-inspired innovation for all of our stakeholders. I look forward to partnering with Brent, Joel and the entire Baxter team as we work to achieve our strategic objectives and deliver exceptional results.\nI'll now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Joel?\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. [indiscernible] to joining the call this morning to provide some additional details on Baxter's fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial performance as well as commentary on our financial outlook for 2025.\nAs Brent mentioned, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results and how we ended the year. Our results came in ahead of our prior guidance on both the top and bottom lines, driven by better-than-expected sales and solid operational performance. Fourth quarter 2024 global sales from continuing operations of $2.75 billion, increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis, and compared favorably to our previous guidance, which called for sales to decline in low single digits.\nOur performance in the quarter was broad-based and reflected positive sales across most of our product divisions. As expected, during the fourth quarter, Hurricane Helene that negatively impacted our sales by approximately $110 million or approximately 400 basis points. Although the overall magnitude is less than the previously anticipated approximately $150 million, given the company's swift recovery efforts.\nFor the full year, Baxter reported sales from considered operations at $10.6 billion, increasing 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis. Hurricane Helene negatively impacted growth for the full year by just over 100 basis points. On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.58, and came in ahead of our prior guidance of $0.50 to $0.53 per share, driven by the favorable half-life results and solid operational performance.\nIn addition, our tax rate came in favorable to our conation, which offset a negative impact from foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 11% in the quarter, primarily due to the negative impact of Hurricane Helene on our results.\nFor the full year, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $1.89 per share and increased 11% over the prior year, reflecting solid underlying operational performance and a benefit from nonoperational items, including lower interest expense and tax rate.\nNow I'll walk through our results for our reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT segment were $1.3 billion, increasing 1% in the quarter and coming in favorable to expectations.\nFull year 2024 sales totaled $5.2 billion, advancing 5% and ahead of the prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth. Adjusting for the impact of William sales growth in the quarter would have been approximately 9% and approximately 7% for the full year. Within NPT, fourth quarter sales from our infusion therapies and Technologies division totaled $1.0 billion and decreased 1%.\nSales in the quarter benefited from significant growth for our U.S. infusion systems portfolio as the rollout of our Nova IQ pub platform continues to build momentum with orders coming in from both new and existing customers. Nutrition sales in the quarter advanced double digits globally reflecting the strength in the U.S. as we continue to build out our alternate site portfolio. Finally, as anticipated, IV Solutions declined in the quarter due to the impact of Hurricane Helene. Q4 sales of Advanced Surgery totaled $292 million and grew 6% globally. Results in the quarter reflected solid demand and positive pricing for our portfolio of [indiscernible] and sealant across the globe. MPT's adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, coming in better than expected due to the sales outperformance.\nMargins declined year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of the hurricane. In Healthcare [indiscernible], or HST, sales in the quarter were in line with expectations and totaled $784 million decreasing 1%. Full year 2024 sales totaled $3 billion and declined 2%. Within the HFC segment, sales in the quarter for our Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division were $504 million, advancing 3% globally. Performance in the quarter was driven by 9% growth in the U.S. for CCS due to continued momentum in our Patient Support Systems or PSS business. which once again delivered strong growth and reflected a benefit from competitive wins in both our men's Search and ICU product lines as well as upgrades for existing customers.\nTotal U.S. capital orders for CCS rose 9% in the quarter and increased 15% for the full year. We are exiting leader with a healthy backlog and strong funnel [indiscernible] to build a positive momentum over the course of 2025. Performance for this division was partially offset by weaker sales outside the U.S., reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year period, we saw growth of 12% as well as softness in both China and France in the current year. Frontline Care sales in the quarter were $280 million and declined 8%. Consistent with commentary over the course of this year, performance in the quarter was impacted by the backlog reductions, which positively contributed to sales in the prior year period. Results in the quarter also reflected the impact of certain market exits and supply constraints, which collectively impacted sales by approximately $15 million in the quarter. We expect the supply constraints that impacted the fourth quarter to be largely resolved for most products in the first quarter of 2025.\nWe believe that performance for this division will also benefit from stabilization in the primary care market over the course of 2025 as well as the launch of central products in the second half of this year that are expected to contribute to positive performance for FLC in 2025 and beyond. HSE fourth quarter adjusted operating margins of 18.5% increased sequentially, continuing the trend of sequential margin improvements.\nMargins declined year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher investments. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Sales in the quarter came in favorable to expectations and totaled $643 million, increasing 8%. Full year 2024 sales were $2.4 billion, advancing at 7%. Fourth quarter sales with an injectable and anesthesia of $383 million, grew 8%. Performance in the quarter reflected mid-teens growth in our specialty injectables portfolio, an anticipated rebound from the third quarter, which was impacted by the timing of some orders.\nGrowth was driven by strong demand for U.S. premixed products and the continued rollout of new products as well as the benefit from targeted sales and marketing initiatives that have been implemented. As expected, lower sales of inhaled anesthesia, which declined mid-single digits, slightly tempered overall performance for the injectables and anesthesia. Within drug compounding, continued demand for services resulted in strong growth of 9% for the quarter.\nPharmaceutical adjusted operating margins were 15.9% for the quarter increasing 600 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margins decreased 370 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact from the MSA entered into following the BPS sales and increased operating expenses to support the new and upcoming launches. The pharmaceuticals team remains focused on expanding margins through improved mix, stabilizing the anesthesia business, driving cost improvements, compounding business and executing our margin improvement initiatives in the integrated supply chain. Other sales, which represent sales not allocated to those segments and primarily include sales and products and services provided directly to certain of our manufacturing facilities were $12 million in the quarter and totaled $67 million for full year 2024.\nBefore moving on to the rest of the P&L results, I wanted to make some comments regarding our continuing operations as reported going forward. I mentioned last quarter, due to the change of moving Kidney Care business results to discontinued operations, corporate costs that have previously been allocated to the Kidney Care segment that would not convey with the Kidney Care business in the sale are now reported in unallocated corporate costs.\nAs we previously commented, we plan to offset a large portion of these expenses in 2025 through income to be received from Vantiv under the transition services agreements, or TSAs, as well as cost containment initiatives the company is already in the process of undertaking. Our goal remains to fully offset the impact of stranded costs and the loss of TSA income by the end of 2027. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin from continuing operations was 44.5%, coming in favorable to expectations and reflecting a sequential improvement of 80 basis points.\nOn a year-over-year basis, adjusted gross margins declined slightly by 10 basis points driven primarily by the impact of Hurricane Helene, higher spend within [indiscernible] manufacturing plants to support product growth as well as the impact of the manufacturing supply agreement following the sale of PS.\nPositive contributors to margin in the quarter were ongoing benefits from our margin improvement programs within our integrated supply chain network as well as favorable product mix and printing initiatives in select markets. Adjusted gross margin from continuing operations for the year totaled 43.5%.\nFourth quarter adjusted SG&A from contingent operations totaled $679 million or 24.7% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 190 basis points from the prior year period as we continue to make select investments to support our growth objectives and new product launches. This increase also included approximately $30 million of select discrete items that are not expected to repeat, including increased employee health care expenses due to high-cost medical claims incurred during the quarter, fees associated with our tax optimization program and phasing of stock compensation expenses. These higher expenses were offset by benefits from lower stranded costs. Full year 2024 adjusted SG&A totaled $2.66 billion and represented 25% of sales. Adjusted R&D spending from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $131 million and represented 4.8% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the prior year period, and reflects our continued investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and bringing innovation to patients across our 2024 full year adjusted R&D totaled $510 million or 4.8% as a percent of sales.\n[indiscernible] compared to the prior year, adjusted operating margins from continued operations decreased 190 basis points, driven by the factors I just discussed as well as the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Full year 2024, adjusted operating margin from continuing operations was approximately $1.5 billion or 13.9% of sales. Net interest expense from continuing operations totaled $90 million in the quarter, an increase of $18 million versus the prior year period, reflecting lower interest income.\nFor the full year, net interest expense totaled $341 million, decreasing $98 million and reflecting the benefit of our debt repayment initiatives. Adjusted other nonoperating income totaled $4 million in the quarter compared to income of $10 million in the prior year period. For the full year, adjusted other nonoperating income that continue operations tax rate was 17.5%, both the full year and fourth quarter tax rates reflect the benefit of initiatives we have undertaken to optimize our global tax rate.\nAnd as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.58 per share for the quarter and decreased 11% versus the prior year. Positive contributions to earnings included improved commercial performance from new product launches and positive pricing. In the quarter, these drivers were offset by the negative impact of Hurricane Helene, which we estimate impacted our results by approximately $0.10 per share and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and interest expense of approximately $0.06 per share.\nFull year 2024 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $1.89 per share, an increase of 11% as compared to the prior year period. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the full year of 2025 and the first quarter of 2025, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. All guidance provided excludes the impact of Kidney Care discontinued operations. For full year 2025, Baxter expects total sales growth of 5% to 6% on a reported basis. This guidance includes an approximate 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange based on current rates as well as approximately $345 million of anticipated MSA revenues from Vantive\nOperationally, Baxter expects sales to grow 4% to 5%. This guidance excludes the impact of foreign exchange, MSA revenues and the planned exit of IP solutions from China as the company continues to focus on driving profitable growth. The negative impact from exiting the IV solutions business in China is approximately 50 basis points to growth. Operational sales guidance for the full year by reportable segment is as follows: For MPT, we expect sales to increase approximately 5%, driven by continued momentum in our Mogam LVP launch, the benefit of positive pricing in the U.S. and other underlying business from Baxter.\nThis guidance excludes the impact of exiting the ID solutions market in China, which is estimated to impact sales growth by 120 basis points. Sales in our HFC segment are expected to increase approximately 3%, and is expected to be balanced across both CCS and FLC. We expect pharmaceuticals to increase approximately 5% to 6% and driven by mid-single-digit growth in both Specialty Injectables and drug compounding.\nNow I'll turn to our outlook for other P&L line items. As previously shared, we expect full year adjusted operating margin from continuing operations to total approximately 16.5% and includes TSA income of approximately $125 million. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense. So total between $250 million to $270 million. On a continued operations basis, we anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 19.5%.\nWe expect our diluted share count to average approximately 55 million shares for the year, which does not contemplate any share repurchases. Based on all these factors, we now anticipate full year adjusted earnings on a continuing operations basis, of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share. This outlook includes an estimated negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from foreign exchange based on current rates. A couple of other quick comments I'd like to make regarding our outlook for 2025. First, I'd point out that our current guidance includes a slight impact from tariffs enacted in China, but does not reflect any impact from potential tariffs that are contemplated for Mexico and Canada, given the fluidity of the situation and potential for further delays implementation and possible exemptions. Second, in 2024, [indiscernible] has previously been allocated to kidney care that did not convey with the discontinued operations presentation were reported in unallocated corporate costs.\nStarting in 2025, these costs will be allocated to the 3 segments, along with related TSA income. Specifics in the first quarter of 2025, we expect continued operational sales growth of approximately 3% to 4% on a reported basis. and approximately 4% on an operational basis. For the first quarter, foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact the top line by more than 200 basis points and MSA revenues are expected to total approximately $60 million.\nThe China ID Solutions exit is expected to impact top line growth by approximately 60 basis points in the first quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.50 per share. This guidance reflects the impact of closing Vantive on January 31 and which negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04 in the quarter as compared to the closing of the sale on December 31 had we been able to close on that date.\nWith that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission.\nIf you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trackman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Jose Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2024 results along with our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2024. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2024. The status and anticipated timing of our ongoing strategic actions, including the proposed Kidney Care separation and the potential impact of our recent pricing actions, regulatory matters, and the macroeconomic environment on adults of operations, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nAnd of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and also available in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Claire, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our second quarter 2024 results reflect the continued progress and momentum of our ongoing strategic transformation. Our performance in the quarter was strong, reinforcing the benefits of our redesigned operating model fueled by the commitment and hard work of our outstanding Baxter team.\nI will start the call today with some brief commentary on our strong second quarter performance before turning the call over to Joel to provide more detail on our results as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. Then as always, we open up to your questions. As you saw in this morning's earnings release, Baxter's second quarter results exceeded our previously issued guidance on both the top and bottom line.\nThis performance further enhances our confidence in our ability to continue executing against our strategic priorities and build upon this underlying momentum. As such, we have increased our full year sales outlook and adjusted EPS guidance accordingly. Our second quarter performance provides further evidence that the steps we have taken to date to centralize and streamline our operating model are yielding results. These actions allow for improved visibility, both externally and internally to our markets as well as increased accountability for our segment leaders.\nThese benefits, coupled with enhanced operational rigor have enabled our teams to better identify opportunities to accelerate innovation to drive growth and expand margins. Turning to some of the highlights from the quarter. Second quarter sales from continuing operations grew 3% on a reported basis and 4% at constant currency rates.\nAs a reminder, continuing operations exclude the impact of our biopharma solutions business, BPS, which we divested at the close of the third quarter of 2023, in line with our strategic transformation road map. Sales growth was broad-based with all 4 Baxter segments delivering growth above our expectations, reflecting positive demand and improved pricing for products across much of the portfolio.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.68. These results were driven by our top line performance, combined with our continued on operational efficiency across the company with ongoing contributions from our integrated supply chain network. Our strong operational performance more than offset the negative impact from foreign exchange and a higher-than-expected tax rate in the quarter.\nNow looking at performance by segment. Medical products and therapies are MPT-delivered, second quarter sales growth of 4% at reported rates and 5% constant currency rates. Growth was fueled by demand across the segment and results included first U.S. sales of our leading-edge Novum IQ large-volume pump with those IQ safety software.\nCustomer interest is high for the Novum platform, including both large volume and syringe pumps with their ability to advance connectivity and intelligent infusion therapy. These pumps are already live and in use and multiple sites, making a difference for caregivers and the patients they serve.\nWe have a healthy funnel of opportunities and anticipate continued strong steady uptake from Novum across the balance of 2024 and beyond through the upgrades of existing customers and conversions of new customers. Our Pharmaceuticals segment grew 9% at reported rates and 11% at constant currency rates.\nPerformance was driven by double-digit growth in our specialty injectables portfolio, reflecting the recent launches of a range of new differentiated injectables as well as significant growth in our drug compounding business. Growth in the segment was partially offset by lower sales of inhaled anesthetics. Health care systems and technologies, or HST performance advanced to 1% at both reported and constant rates.\nOur Care and Connectivity Solutions division delivered mid-single-digit growth, reflecting positive market demand and strong U.S. capital orders, which increased meaningfully both sequentially year-over-year. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by an expected decline in the Front Line Care division, primarily due to a difficult comparison though the prior year period and continued softness in the U.S. primary care market.\nOverall, HST results in the quarter benefited from the operational improvements that we are in process of implementing to enhance ongoing performance. As we discussed last quarter, we expect to see these efforts continue to yield positive results as 2024 continues and going forward. Finally, Kidney Care was flat year-over-year at reported rates and grew 3% at constant currency rates.\nPerformance continues to be fueled by demand for our acute therapies portfolio plus strong growth for peritoneal dialysis products due to positive volume and pricing globally. Growth was partially offset by an expected decline in sales of in-center hemodialysis products due to select product and market exits.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident and excited about the future of our company and our potential to continue to accelerate sales growth, expand our margins and drive innovation that will deliver benefits to our customers shareholders and many other stakeholder communities. As you all know, we launched our strategic transformation in January of 2023 to recast as a more simplified, more agile, a more focused company, passionate in its commitment to operational excellence and better positioned to accelerate growth customer-inspired innovation.\nAmong the elements central to our plan was the separation of the KidneyCare business from Baxter in order to provide both companies with improved strategic clarity and greater flexibility to pursue the unique investment priorities. We are continuing to make steady progress towards the separation and while the ultimate pathway has not yet been determined.\nWe currently expect the separation will occur in late 2024 or early 2025. With the separation of Kidney Care, we have a unique opportunity to redefine ourselves while also remain firmly grounded in what has powered our success for nearly a century. Our life sustaining mission our focus on essential health care, our commitment to innovation and at the heart of it all. our employees whose unparalleled dedication in terms our aspirations into impact. Together, we are united energized and eager to take Baxter into a future of sustained health care leadership. With that, I'll pass it over to Joel to provide more detail on our results for the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year.\n\nJoshua Thomas Jennings\n\nMD & Senior Research Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our second quarter results, which came in ahead of our expectations and further reinforce our goal of consistently meeting and exceeding our financial objectives. Second quarter 2024 global sales of $3.8 billion increased 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis and, as mentioned, compared favorably to our previously issued guidance.\nOutperformance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales in many product categories and particularly in patient support systems, infusion therapies, peritoneal dialysis and pro compounding. As compared to the prior year period, sales excluding Kidney Care, increased approximately 5% on a constant currency basis.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.68 per share, increasing 24% versus the prior year period and ahead of our prior guidance of $0.65 to $0.67 per share. Results in the quarter were driven by strong operational performance, with continued momentum commercially partially offset by a negative impact from nonoperational items totaling $0.05 per share due to foreign exchange and a higher-than-anticipated tax rate.\nNow I'll walk through our results by reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will affect growth at constant currency rates. Sales of our Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT segment, were $1.3 billion increasing 5%. Within MPT, second quarter sales from our infusion therapies and Technologies division totaled $1 billion and increased 5%.\nSales in the quarter benefited from strong growth internationally across the division, particularly for our IV solutions and Infusion Systems products, which benefited from both volume and pricing gains. Solid demand for nutrition globally also contributed to growth in the quarter. Sales from Advanced Surgery totaled $277 million and grew 4%, reflecting solid growth internationally. For our Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $748 million and increased 1% coming in ahead of our expectations.\nWithin the HST segment, sales in our care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS, division were $452 million, growing 4% or Performance rebounded in the quarter driven by a significant growth in orders, both sequentially and year-over-year for our CCS products. As Joe mentioned, the actions we are taking to enhance our operational rigor and improved execution are early results.\nThese factors contribute to orders growth across our CCS division of more than 40% compared to the prior year and over 60% sequentially. Results in the quarter included upgrades to both existing customers and competitive gains within our Patient Support Systems business. We are very encouraged by the growth of orders in the U.S. this quarter, which will be phased in over the course of the second half of this year and into 2025.\nOverall, we believe the initiatives we are implementing to improve commercial execution will continue to lead to improved performance, both in the second half of this year and beyond. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $296 million, declining 4%, in line with our expectations and represented a double-digit improvement sequentially. We Growth in the quarter continued to be impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year as backlog reductions positively contributed to growth in the prior year period.\nPerformance in the quarter was also impacted by ongoing softness in the primary care market, which negatively impacted growth in both our connected monitoring and intelligent diagnostics product portfolios. The timing and release of government orders in the U.S. also impacted growth in the quarter. We expect this division to return to growth in the second half of the year as growth for products in other settings such as cardiology and acute is anticipated to more than offset the continued softness in primary care and lower government orders.\nThe adverse to the prior year impact from the backlog reduction will also benefit performance in the second half of the year. Moving on to Pharmaceuticals. Sales in this segment were $602 million increasing 11%. Performance in the quarter reflects double-digit growth in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches as well as strong demand for services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally, which has benefited from supply constraints for certain customers that are expected to ease in the second half of the year.\nPerformance in the quarter was partially offset by lower sales of inhaled anesthetics globally. Sales in the quarter for our Kidney Care segment totaled $1.1 billion increasing 3%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $917 million, increasing 1%. Strong PD growth in the quarter was partially offset by the expected negative impact from certain product and market exits in our in-center HD business as well as lower sales in China due to government procurement initiatives.\nWe estimate that these items negatively impacted sales by just over $50 million in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $201 million representing growth of 9%, driven by strong demand and competitive conversions in the United States. Other sales, which represent sales not allocated to the segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly to certain of our manufacturing facilities were $22 million and declined 5% during the quarter.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totaled 1.2% and represented an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the strong operational efficiencies we are realizing within our integrated supply chain network, resulting from execution of the margin improvement programs we're implementing and the anniversary of the negative margin impacts from inflationary pressures that drove higher cost of goods sold in the prior year period.\nPricing initiatives in select markets also positively contributed to margin improvement in the quarter. Product mix and foreign exchange partially offset margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $873 million or 22.9% as a percentage of sales an increase of 10 basis points from the prior year period as we are making select investments to support our growth objectives and new product launches.\nSG&A leverage is expected to continue to improve as sales ramp over the course of the year. Adjusted R&D spend in the quarter totaled $175 million, and represented 4.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the prior year period and reflects our continued investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and bringing innovation to patients across our segments.\nThese factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year driven by the factors above, which more than offset a negative impact on operating margins of approximately 70 basis points due to foreign exchange. Net interest expense totaled $85 million in the quarter, a decrease of $39 million versus the prior year period, driven by debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the proceeds of our BPS divestiture.\nWe plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities. During July, faster finalized a bank finance bridge loan in the form of a delayed draw term loan or DTTL and move a public bond financing with a total size of $2.05 billion.\nThe DTTL provides certainty and ability to fund debt maturities coming due in the fourth quarter and the events we haven't completed the Kidney Care separation by that time. We expect to utilize proceeds from the separation to repay the loan, if outstanding. We felt this was a better option as compared to bond financing given the more temporary nature of the cash need and the high cost of issuance in new term debt in current markets.\nAdjusted other nonoperating income totaled $20 million in the quarter compared to an expense of $22 million in the prior year period, which included losses on both foreign exchange and marketable securities. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 23.9% came in higher than expectations and increased as compared to the prior year tax rate of 17.8%. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, decreased utilization of foreign tax credits in the current year period and a nonrecurring foreign tax incentive in the prior year period.\nAnd as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continued operations totaled $0.68 per share and increased 24% versus prior year primarily driven by improved commercial performance and a reduction in interest expense, offset by the impact of foreign exchange and a higher tax rate. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance.\nOn a constant currency basis, this increase reflects the outperformance we realized in the second quarter and continued momentum for our businesses. Constant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segment is as follows: For MPT, we now expect sales growth of approximately 5%. This is an increase from the prior guidance of 4% to 5% and reflects the outperformance year-to-date and continued momentum for our Novum platform.\nSales in our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment are expected to be approximately flat to prior year, consistent with prior guidance. This guidance reflects improved performance in the second half of the year but also assumes the installation of some CCS orders are phased to 2025. In addition, our guidance assumes FLC performance also improves in the second half of the year, put that both primary care and government orders declined in 2024, neither of which we believe represent market share losses.\nWe expect both the primary care market and orders for the government will improve in 2025. We now expect pharmaceutical sales growth of approximately 7%, which compares favorably to prior guidance of 6% to 7% and reflects the strong start to the year and continued momentum for our new product launches as well as increased contribution from drug compounding.\nThe contribution from drug compounding is expected to meaningfully slow in the second half of the year as supply constraints for certain hospital customers ease and the business focuses on driving more profitable growth. Collectively, sales for these 3 remaining Baxter segments are now expected to increase approximately 4% in 2024 and exit the second half of the year at the higher end of our prior expectation of 4% to 5%.\nFor Kidney Care, we now expect sales growth of 1% to 2% as compared to 2023. This also compares favorably to prior guidance and reflects the underlying momentum of this business. Now turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase by more than 50 basis points in 2024.\nWe expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total approximately $330 million in aggregate during 2024. We now anticipate a full year adjusted [indiscernible] of approximately 23%. We expect our diluted share count to average 511 million shares for the year.\nBased on all these factors, we now anticipate full year adjusted earnings excluding special items of $2.93 to $3.01 per diluted share, which also compares favorably to prior guidance of $2.88 to $2.98 per diluted share and reflects the outperformance we realized in the second quarter and expect for the remainder of the year, and includes an incremental headwind from nonoperational items totaling approximately $0.02 per share.\nSpecific to the third quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of 3% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.77 to $0.79 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter 2024 results along with our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024; new product development, including the potential impact of recent regulatory clearances with status and potential impact of our ongoing strategic and recent pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters and the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on improving supply chain conditions and evolving customer capital spending trends; contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and also available in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results and then provide some updates regarding our ongoing strategic transformation. Joel Grade will follow with a closer look at our financials as well as our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Then, as always, we'll open it up to your questions.\nBaxter started the year on a positive note, delivering solid results, which exceeded previously issued guidance on both the top line and bottom line first quarter sales from continuing operations with 2% on a reported basis and 3% at constant currency rates. This compares to our original outlook of approximately 1% reported and 1% to 2% constant currency.\nOverall revenue growth was driven by positive demand and pricing for a broad range of Baxter products. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations of $0.65 came in above our prior guidance range of $0.59 to $0.62 per share. This performance was fueled by top line results, combined with our intense focus on driving improved supply chain execution across our manufacturing network.\nOverall, performance is clearly benefiting from the streamlining and strategic clarity afforded by our newly implemented operating model, as we leverage the advantages of improved visibility globally, increased accountability and function of verticalization. Crisp execution of our margin improvement initiatives, along with a more stable macroeconomic backdrop, is driving enhanced performance across our integrated supply chain operations.\nAnd as always, Baxter benefits from its emphasis on essential health care needs in combination with the diversity and durability of our portfolio. This is clearly affecting our overall performance this quarter as the strength of our results across Medical Products and Therapies, Pharmaceuticals and Kidney Care helped offset underperformance in our Healthcare Systems & Technology segment.\nTaking a closer look at our performance by segment. Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT, delivered first quarter growth of 6% at both reported and constant currency rates. Growth was fueled by both pricing and volume gains amid stable market conditions globally.\nWe believe we're well positioned to build on our momentum in MPT with the recent U.S. FDA clearance of our leading-edge Novum IQ volume infusion pump and Dose IQ Safety Software. This integrated platform, which also includes our previously cleared syringe pump, comprises a single connected intelligent system offering a broad range of benefits for nurses, physicians and other clinicians as well as the patients who depend on them.\nOur Novum IQ technology is now available to order in the U.S. as part of our expanding portfolio of connected care solutions. Customers are excited about the Novum platform's ability to advance connectivity and intelligent infusion therapy. And the team is already engaged with many customers interested in this new technology.\nIn fact, the large existing Novum syringe [indiscernible] customer will begin implementing the full Novum platform in the next few months. In just last week, we secured a 100% competitive account conversion to Baxter pumps with a top-tier multistate health system.\nAs you may remember, Novum LVB clearance was not factored in our original FY 2024 outlook. Given the time of the approval, we expect the contribution from Novum launch to be more notable in the second half of the year, even as it displaces, to some degree, sales of our Spectrum IQ pump and the outlook we are sharing today reflects this expected benefit along with the outperformance in the first quarter.\nAlso in late-breaking MPT news last week, we received FDA approval of an expanded indication for Clinolipid, our mixed oil [indiscernible] that provides a source of calories and essential omega fatty acids for parenteral nutrition patients.\nClinolipid is now indicated for use in pediatric patients, including preterm and term neonates. This is an example of our continued commitment to meeting the nutritional needs of patients of all ages and is expected to be a positive addition to our nutrition portfolio.\nOur Pharmaceutical segment achieved a growth of 11% in the first quarter at both reported and constant currency rates. Results for the quarter reflect a benefit from our recent new product launches in the U.S., including 5 new injectables in key therapeutic areas, including anti-infective and antihypertensive medications.\nTogether, these new product introductions demonstrate our continued focus on innovation and delivering differentiated products that address areas of need with proprietary ready-to-use presentations, they can simplify the preparation process and support patient safety. Our performance in this segment was also strengthened by heightened demand outside the U.S. for our drug compounding services.\nThis overall momentum more than offset declines from inhaled anesthesia products. Our Kidney Care segment delivered 3% growth at reported rates and 4% at constant currency. Growth was driven by pricing benefits as well as a strong demand for our Acute Therapies portfolio and steady gains of peritoneal patients in nearly all markets.\nGrowth in this business was tempered by the impact from select product and market exits and reduced volumes in China due to government-based procurement initiatives and a lower patient sensors. As noted, positive results across these 3 segments helped offset disappointing performance in Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST, which declined 9% at both reported and constant currency rates. This decline was driven to some extent by order timing as well as operational factors.\nOur new operating model has been vital in helping us isolate underlying challenges affecting this segment. The size of steps are already underway to address and enhance performance in this business and help realize our full opportunity in this space. These include forging a deeper partnership between the commercial and enterprise account teams focused on the value and quality of the broader portfolio.\nImplementing new tools and processes focused on increasing visibility to historical purchases, creating greater differentiation in customer engagement practices and related measures. We expect these steps collectively to improve operational performance for HST, particularly in the second half of the year. I remain excited about HST and the positive contribution it is expected to deliver to the overall Baxter portfolio. The team is working incredibly hard to address this challenge and turnaround performance in this business and I'm grateful for their dedication and efforts.\nBefore I pass it to Joel, I will share an update on our proposed Kidney Care separation as we announced in the March 4th 8-K filing, we are now pursuing dual pathways in the proposed separation of this business, including potentially selling the business to a private equity investor.\nThe ultimate path forward will be determined consistent with our objective to accelerate performance for both entities and maximize shareholder value. We currently expect the separation to take place in the second half of 2024.\nLooking ahead, I want to express my excitement about Baxter overall trajectory. Our life sustaining mission is as always our North Star and our colleagues around the world making it come alive tenacious focus on execution and operational excellence.\nOur progress against our strategic transformation initiative showcases our ability to deliver on what we set out to accomplish. The benefits are clear in our overall outperformance for the quarter. Our building momentum, our recent innovation milestones and the progress of our proposed Kidney Care separation journey. We will continue to maintain the pace and intensity of our transformation and take the necessary steps so that all of our segments are well positioned to power our performance going forward.\nI will now pass it to Joel to provide more detail on our performance and outlook.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which came in ahead of our expectations. First quarter 2024 global sales of $3.6 billion increased 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, and as mentioned, compared favorably to our previously issued guidance.\nPerformance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales across all our product divisions, with the exception of those within our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.65 per share, increasing 33% versus the prior year period and ahead of our prior guidance of $0.59 to $0.62 per share. These results reflect the meaningful operational improvements we are recognizing both commercially as well as within our integrated supply chain network, and these factors drove our outperformance in the quarter.\nNow I'll walk through our results by reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products & Therapies, or MPT segment, were $1.2 billion, increasing 6%.\nWithin MPT, first quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies & Technologies division totaled $966 million and increased 6%. Sales in the quarter benefited from strong growth internationally across the division, including in our IV solutions, nutrition and infusion systems portfolios.\nSolid demand in the U.S. for IV solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. Sales of Advanced Surgery totaled $263 million and grew 8%, coming in ahead of expectations, and reflecting strong growth internationally.\nFor our Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $667 million and declined 9%. Within the HST segment, sales in our Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division, were $402 million, declining 7%. Performance in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including the phasing of product installations, particularly for care communications, which is expected to accelerate later in the year by the timing of capital orders, which increased mid-single digits in the quarter but are expected to ramp more meaningfully over the course of the year.\nBy lower rental revenues, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $5 million. And finally, by certain operational challenges, for which the team is in the process of implementing clear plans to improve performance and enhance commercial rigor. Given all these factors, we expect to see significant improvements for CCS in both orders and revenue in the second half of the year, which is similar to the [indiscernible] we experienced last year in this division.\nFront Line Care sales in the quarter were $265 million, declining 12%. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison in the prior year as backlog reductions positively contributed to growth in the prior year period. Performance in the quarter was also affected by softness in the primary care market which negatively impacted sales in both our connected monitoring and intelligent diagnostics product portfolios.\nSimilar to CCS, we expect performance to meaningfully improve in the second half of the year as market conditions for primary care are anticipated to ease, the pace of customer orders are expected to increase, and we anniversary the prior year impact from the backlog reduction.\nSales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $578 million, increasing 11%. Performance in the quarter reflected double-digit growth in both our U.S. and international injectables portfolio, driven by new product launches as well as continued strong demand for services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally.\nMoving on to Kidney Care. Sales in the quarter were $1.1 billion, increasing 4%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $888 million, increasing 2%. Solid PD growth in the quarter was partially offset by the negative impact from certain products and market exits in our in-center HD business as well as reduced sales in China due to government procurement initiatives and lower patient census volumes following the pandemic.\nWe estimate that these items negatively impacted sales by approximately $50 million in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $214 million, representing growth of 15%, driven by strong demand and competitive wins in the U.S. and solid performance internationally.\nOther sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily includes sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities, were $16 million and declined 47% during the quarter, in line with our expectations and reflecting reduced demand for certain contract manufacturing volumes.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totaled 42.5% and represented an increase of 170 basis points over the prior year and was favorable to our expectations. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the strong operational efficiencies we are realizing within our integrated supply chain network, resulting from execution of the margin improvement programs we're implementing and the anniversary of the negative margin impacts from inflationary pressures that drove higher cost of goods sold in the prior year period.\nPricing initiatives in select markets also positively contributed to margin improvement in the quarter. First quarter margins also reflected a benefit from the closure of our dialyzer facility as production in the facility was increased in advance of the closure, resulting in better absorption and lower costs for these dialyzers.\nThis benefit is expected to be isolated to the first quarter. Overall product mix in the quarter did partially offset margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $856 million or 23.8% as a percentage of sales consistent with the prior year period as ongoing transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies were offset by higher spend in select investments in sales and marketing initiatives.\nSG&A leverage is expected to improve as sales ramp over the course of the year. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter totaled $160 million and represented 4.5 as a percentage of sales, similar to the prior year period and reflects our continued investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and bringing innovation to patients across our [indiscernible].\nThese factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 14.3%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense totaled $78 million in the quarter, a decrease of $39 million versus the prior year period, driven by debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2023 with proceeds from our BPS divestiture.\nWe plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities. Adjusted other nonoperating income totaled $7 million in the quarter, compared to income of $2 million in the prior year period. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.0% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a valuation allowance recognized in the quarter.\nAnd as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.65 per share and increased 33% versus the prior year, primarily driven by commercial performance and operational efficiencies within our integrated supply chain.\nLet me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2024, Baxter now expects total sales growth of approximately 2% on a reported basis and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis, which is an increase from prior guidance of approximately 2% on a constant currency basis.\nConstant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows: For MPT, we expect sales growth of 4% to 5%. This is an increase from the prior guidance of 3% to 4% and reflects the first quarter outperformance and the inclusion of Novum, which is currently expected to contribute an incremental $25 million to infusion pump sales and reflects some cannibalization of prior planned sales of Spectrum.\nSales in our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment are expected to be flat to the prior year as compared to previous guidance of approximately 3%. As mentioned earlier, we expect performance to meaningfully improve in the second half of the year, driven by the factors discussed, including timing of installations, order phasing and improved operational execution. We expect pharmaceutical sales growth of 6% to 7%, which compares favorably to prior guidance of 4% to 5% and reflects the strong start to the year and continued momentum for our new product launches.\nCollectively, sales for these Baxter businesses are expected to increase 3% to 4% in 2024. For Kidney Care, we expect sales growth of flat to 1% as compared to 2023. This also compares favorably to prior guidance and reflects the underlying momentum of this business.\nNow turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 50 basis points in 2024. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense, to total approximately $350 million in aggregate during 2024.\nWe continue to anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate between 22.0% and 22.5%. We expect our diluted share count to increase slightly and average 511 million shares for the year. Based on all these factors, we now anticipate full year adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.88 to $2.98 per diluted share, which also compares favorably to prior guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share and reflects the outperformance we realized in the first quarter.\nSpecific to the second quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call will be recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, Baxter's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results along with our financial outlook for 2024. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, new product development including the impact and status of pending regulatory approvals, the status and potential impact of our ongoing strategic and recent pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters in the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on improving supply chain conditions and evolving customer capital spending trends contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.\nPlease refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation, along with our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with a brief overview of Baxter's performance for the quarter and the year. After this, I will review our progress against the transformational actions we laid out for you just over a year ago, including the planned separation of our Kidney Care business. I will then turn it over to Joel Grade, who will walk through our results and outlook in more detail. Finally, we will open it up for your questions.\nAs you saw this morning, Baxter reported strong performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 with top line sales exceeding our projections and bottom line results coming in at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, continuing operations exclude the impact of our biopharma solutions business, which we divested at the close of the third quarter. Sales from continuing operations rose 4% on a reported basis ahead of our outlook of 1% to 2% growth. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, also ahead of our guidance, which projected a growth of approximately 1%.\nStrength in the quarter was broad-based with year-over-year growth in the health care systems and technologies, medical products and therapies and pharmaceuticals, which was slightly offset by an expected decline in Kidney Care. Relative to expectations, both of our chronic therapies and [indiscernible] divisions reported better-than-expected sales. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.88 at the top end of our prior guidance range of $0.85 to $0.88.\nOur fourth quarter results further reinforce our building momentum. In 2023, we focused on consistently meeting and/or exceeding our financial outlook, particularly in light of the significant supply chain and macro environmental challenges we encountered during 2022. As a testament to this focus, over the course of 2023, we were able to deliver sequential improvement every quarter, and we believe this performance provides us with a solid foundation to build off in 2024.\nTurning to the full year sales from continuing operations of $14.8 billion advanced 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by sales growth for all of our segments at constant currency rates.\nFirst, looking at the constant currency sales growth in the segment set to comprise our future Baxter portfolio following the planned Kidney Care separation. Sales in Healthcare Systems & Technologies were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year. Medical Products and therapy sales rose 4% in both the quarter and for the year, and sales in Pharmaceuticals were up 7% for both the quarter and the year. Performance in these segments was filled by strong execution across our commercial and manufacturing teams. New product launches increased the availability of electromechanical component and a more stable supply chain and macroeconomic environment relative to the significant volatility experienced last year.\nWith respect to hospital capital spending, while we still believe there may be pockets of softer spending, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we experienced every quarter in 2023 within our Care and Connectivity Solutions division. Our Kidney Care segment, which will be called Vantive post separation, declined 1% in the quarter and grew 1% for the year at constant rates.\nStrong growth in Acute Therapies was offset by flat growth in chronic therapies, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison due to certain discrete items that benefited sales in the prior year as well as lower sales in China due to the impact of government based procurement initiatives and the lower patient sensors due to the pandemic.\nThe underlying state of the Kidney Care business continues to improve and the momentum we are building is evident. Among key indicators, we are seeing renewed growth in the peritoneal dialysis patient population following the earlier impact of pandemic-driven mortality issues. Our strategic rationale and hypothesis for an independent Kidney Care business remains as strong as ever. Our team is executing and gearing up for a successful separation this year.\nGiven overall business performance and environmental dynamics, I'm optimistic as we look ahead to the prospects for both Baxter and [ Vantive ] as separate entities. Our solid financial performance was achieved in parallel with meaningful progress against the strategic priorities we announced to open 2023. We kicked off the year with an urgency to rethink both the scope and velocity of our transformation. Since then, our team delivered executing on a range of goals to position a separated Baxter and [ Vantive ] for a new era of enhanced patient and shareholder impact, enabled by heightened strategic clarity, operational efficiency and innovation.\nWe realigned our businesses into newly streamlined simplified operating model based on globally integrated business segments. Each segment is led by a seasoned and knowledgeable executive who has profit and loss accountability, inclusive of dedicated commercial research and development, manufacturing, supply chain and functional teams. We are already seeing the benefits of improved line of sight to our customers and greater agility to recognize and capture growth opportunities.\nWe completed the divestiture of our biopharma solutions business at the close of Q3, which further allowed us to streamline our strategic focus on our core businesses. We are in the process of utilizing the after-tax proceeds of approximately $3.7 billion to pay down debt in line with our stated capital allocation priorities, including $2.8 billion of repayments in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, we continue to make progress [ store ] separating Vantive out of Baxter. As we have consistently stated, we believe this separation will ultimately empower both companies to pursue their own unique strategic and investment priorities. Many of you had the opportunity to meet the [indiscernible] CEO, Chris Toth the JPMorgan conference last month. Chris has been hard at work building out his organization, meeting customers and setting near-term and long-term strategies. Among recent developments, Chris has onboarded [ Matt Harbor ] as designated Vantive CFO. Many of you may know Matt from his days as CFO at [ NuVasive].\nMeanwhile, we continue to hit key separation milestones across operational, legal, regulatory, supply chain IT domains. In summary, 2023 was a year of rebuilding and renewing our momentum. We made significant progress on an ambitious slate of strategic initiatives coupled with solid financial performance while never losing focus on our foundational commitments to our customers and patients.\nAdditionally, we have created a new potential to embrace more exciting opportunities to come. I do not take the accomplishments of this past year for granted, I want to thank and recognize all of the employees who hard work and commitment helped us to achieve our objectives. I have never been more impressed by what a team could achieve in a single year, and that is why I'm so energized by our potential to seize on opportunities we have created together. Now we turn it over to Joel for a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance as well as our 2024 outlook.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call this morning to provide some additional details on Baxter's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance, as well as commentary on our financial outlook for 2024.\nAs Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which represented another step forward in our ongoing business transformation. Fourth quarter 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 4% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis and compared favorably to our previously issued guidance of 1% to 2% reported and approximately 1% constant currency. Outperformance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales in many product categories and particularly in chronic therapies and drug compounding.\nAs compared to the prior year period, we reported solid quarterly growth in health care systems and technologies, pharmaceuticals and medical products and therapies. And collectively, sales for these 3 businesses, which will comprise Baxter post the separation, increased approximately 5%. As expected, Kidney Care sales declined slightly in the quarter due to the factors Joe mentioned earlier.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings totaled $0.88 per share, increasing 13% versus the prior year period. These results reflect the ongoing operational improvements we are recognizing both commercially as well as within our supply chain network as that team successfully executes on its margin improvement programs. Lower interest expense and a benefit from foreign exchange also contributed favorably to the quarter, partially offset by the impact of a higher tax rate compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter came in at the high end of our expected range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share, primarily driven by better sales and operational performance.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies segments were $1.3 billion, increasing 4%. Full year 2023 sales totaled $5 billion also advancing 4%. Within Medical products and therapies, fourth quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies and Technologies division totaled $1 billion and increased 4%. Sales in the quarter benefited from strength in our IV Solutions portfolio, particularly outside the United States as well as solid performance in our infusion system portfolio. Sales from Advanced Surgery totaled $278 million and grew 6%, coming in ahead of expectations and reflecting strong growth internationally.\nFor our Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $795 million and increased 7%. Full year 2023 sales totaled $3 billion, advancing 3%. Within the HST segment, sales in our care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division or $492 million, increasing 11%. Performance in the quarter benefited from double-digit growth in all key product categories within the division, including our care communications, surgical solutions and Patient Support Systems product offerings. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower contribution from rental revenues.\nFourth quarter United States orders within CCS continued to improve sequentially, but notably also grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time in 2023. While we are encouraged by the improvement in capital spending we've seen from our U.S. hospital customers, we continue to believe there may still be select pockets of cautiousness in the marketplace.\nFront Line Care sales in the quarter were $303 million, increasing 2%. Given the improvements in electromechanical component availability over the course of 2023, we're able to successfully address our elevated backlog and exited the year at more normalized levels. Sales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $596 million, increasing 7%. For the full year, sales were $2.2 billion, also advancing 7%. Performance in the quarter reflected double-digit growth in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches as well as continued strong demand for our services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally.\nOther sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities were $18 million and declined 58% during the quarter, in line with our expectations. This lower level of sales reflects reduced demand for certain contract manufacturing volumes and the termination of a royalty arrangement.\nMoving on to Kidney Care. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion and declined 1%. Full year 2023 sales totaled $4.5 billion and increased 1%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $950 million, declining 3%, though as mentioned earlier, came in better than expected. Sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which included certain discrete items in the U.S. that totaled approximately $25 million.\nFinally, performance in chronic therapies continues to be impacted by lower sales in China due to certain government-based procurement initiatives and a lower patient census due to the pandemic. We estimate that collectively, these country-specific factors negatively impacted sales by approximately $35 million in the quarter.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $206 million, representing growth of 6% with strength across most regions, including double-digit growth in the United States, where we've now rebased this business following the pandemic-related benefits we previously experienced.\nNow moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totaled 42% and represented an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the stabilization of macroeconomic factors and inflationary pressures that previously contributed to higher cost for raw materials, overhead and labor that impacted our margins earlier in the year. Margin improvement in the quarter also benefited from pricing initiatives in select markets and ongoing margin improvement programs in our integrated supply chain network.\nPerformance for the quarter was in line with our expectations as top line outperformance in the quarter was driven by lower-margin divisions, which drove a slightly negative gross profit mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $829 million or 21.3% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year period. Performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies, offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans compared to the prior year, and select investments in sales and marketing initiatives.\nAdjusted research and development spending in the quarter totaled $172 million, and represented 4.4% as a percentage of sales, increasing 20 basis points versus the prior year. We have ramped up our R&D efforts, particularly increasing our investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and, like SG&A, R&D expenses include the impact of higher employee incentive accruals as compared to the prior year period. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 16.2% and an increase of 30 basis points.\nOverall, we are very pleased with the second half margin expansion we're able to realize with operating margins improving approximately 300 basis points in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of 2023. Net interest expense totaled $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of $44 million versus the prior year and down $55 million sequentially, driven by debt repayment of approximately $2.8 billion associated with the utilization of the proceeds from our BPS divestiture. We plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities.\nAdjusted other nonoperating income totaled $11 million in the quarter compared to an expense of $11 million in the prior year period. Year-over-year improvement was largely due to lower foreign exchange losses incurred as compared with the prior year period. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.0% compared to 14.6% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by statute expirations on certain tax positions benefiting the prior year period.\nThe tax rate in the quarter came in higher than expected, primarily driven by changes in geographic earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings totaled $0.88 and increased 13% versus the prior year, primarily driven by better-than-expected sales and operational efficiencies as well as lower interest expense, partially offset by the tax rate in the quarter.\nFor the full year, Baxter's adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased 14% to $2.60 per diluted share, reflecting the impact of higher cost of goods sold driven primarily by the macro environmental factors we previously discussed, greater annual employee bonus accruals as well as increased nonoperating expenses. These factors were partially offset by our operational and supply chain savings initiatives.\nWith respect to cash flow, we generated free cash flow for the year of over $1 billion from continuing operations compared to $411 million in the prior year period. Going forward, cash flow generation and, in particular, improving our working capital metrics is a key priority both for me and the Baxter team.\nTo close on our full year results, we are pleased with our operating performance through 2023, which reflected both consistent progress and building momentum. And it is important to note that our teams were able to achieve this performance while also making meaningful progress against our strategic initiatives designed to enhance our future performance and drive incremental value for all stakeholders. We look forward to building on that positive momentum as we enter 2024.\nLet me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance.\nFor full year 2024, Baxter expects total sales growth of 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, as the impact from foreign exchange is currently expected to be minimal on a full year basis. Constant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows: for medical products and therapies, we expect sales growth of 3% to 4%; sales in our Healthcare Systems and Technology segments are expected to increase approximately 3%; we expect pharmaceuticals sales growth of 4% to 5%; Collectively, sales for these remaining Baxter businesses are expected to increase 3% to 4% in 2024; for Kidney Care, we expect sales growth to decline 1% to 2% as compared to 2023.\nFactors impacting year-over-year growth are primarily driven by select market and product exits in connection with our margin expansion initiatives for this segment which we estimate will negatively impact sales by approximately $150 million. Additionally, the incremental impact from the ongoing government procurement initiatives in China is expected to total approximately $70 million in 2024.\nNow turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We expect adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 50 basis points in 2024. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total approximately $350 million in aggregate during 2024. We anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate between 22.0% and 22.5%, which reflects an approximate 100 basis point impact to the 2024 tax rate from the implementation of [ Pillar 2]. We expect our diluted share count to increase slightly and average 510 million shares for the year.\nBased on all these factors, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and 1% to 2% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.59 to $0.62 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Jose Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Joel Grade, Baxter's newly appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Stevens, Baxter's Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller and former Interim CFO.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter 2023 financial results along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Please note that we closed the sale of our BioPharma Solutions or BPS business at the end of the third quarter and results in the current and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect BPS as discontinued operations. Restated schedules reflecting that discontinued operations presentation are included in the appendix to our earnings presentation and available in the IR section of our website.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. new product developments, including the impact and status of pending regulatory approvals, the status and potential impact of our ongoing strategic and recent pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters and the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on continuing supply chain challenges and evolving customer capital spending trends, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.\nPlease refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, -- on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. I am pleased to be joined this morning by Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, Brian Stevens, and to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Joel Grade, to the call. .\nI will begin the call today with an overview of our third quarter performance and the continuing momentum of our ongoing transformational initiatives. I will also share a perspective on the progress and potential of our proposed kidney care spin-off, including some context around recent developments in that therapeutic area. Brian will provide a more detailed account of Baxter's third quarter and financial outlook. And as always, we will close with your questions. To get started, Baxter reported solid third quarter results that came in ahead of our projections, both on the top and bottom line sales from continuing operations rose 3% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis.\nAs Clare noted earlier, sales from continuing operations exclude Baxter's BioPharma Solutions, or BPS business, which Baxter divested at the close of the quarter. Sales in the aggregate, including discontinued operations also increased 3% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis. Our better-than-expected top line performance was driven by positive demand for many of Baxter's products combined with continued abatement of supply chain challenges. On the bottom line, third quarter aggregate adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.82, comprising EPS of $0.68 for continuing operations and $0.14 for discontinued operations. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations exceeded the top end of our outlook range of $0.65 to $0.67, driven by end market stabilization and good sequential margin improvement across our business, which reflects strong execution against our strategic priorities.\nOverall, and especially when compared to what we've seen in recent quarters, we view the current market environment as relatively stable, though we continue to monitor hospital capital spending, particularly in light of an elevated interest rate environment. While we have seen sequential improvement in orders within our Care and Connectivity Solutions division, we continue to expect hospitals to exercise some degree of caution with their capital budgets. The momentum we are building in financial performance is also reflected in the progress we're experiencing across the strategic priorities we laid out for you earlier this year, these initiatives, in combination are focused on enhancing strategic clarity, increasing operational efficiency and accelerating innovation to deliver greater value for all of our stakeholders.\nDuring the third quarter, we achieved some pivotal milestones towards driving this improved performance. First, we've been hard at work realigning the businesses to simplify and streamline our operating model. These efforts are resulting in a more agile company with better visibility to our global markets and customers. In line with this realignment, today is the first time we formally report our results under the new operating model as 4 global vertically integrated business segments; Medical Products & Therapies, Healthcare Systems & Technologies, Pharmaceuticals and Kidney Care. Each segment now has global profit and loss accountability, dedicated commercial operations and fully aligned research and development, manufacturing, supply chain and functional support teams.\nThis reorganization is already creating meaningful advantages in helping us set priorities, build alignment and operationalize our strategy, advantages they have already in our expected to continue to pay dividends going forward. Our new segments are also a reminder of our highly diversified portfolio with strong brands a global presence and high trust among clinicians and patients. The diversity and durability of our portfolio focused on essential health care needs helps fuel sustained demand on multiple fronts, allowing us to better weather challenges that can emerge while continuing to deliver on our mission of saving and sustaining lives.\nAs discussed, this quarter, we also completed the divestiture of our BioPharma Solutions business, further streamlining our focus on our core businesses. We are deploying substantially all of our estimated net after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.7 billion to pay down debt in accordance with our stated capital allocation priorities. The third transformational actions we laid out at the start of the year was the planned separation what is now our Kidney Care segment. We are making significant progress and currently expect to launch Kidney Care as an independent publicly traded company by July 2024.\nI continue to be impressed with the leadership of Chris Toth, who joined us in June as President of our Kidney Care segment and designated CEO of Vantive. In just 5 months, he has already proven himself as an astute, decisive, engaging leader. He has already surrounded himself with an outstanding team of experienced direct reports drawn from across Baxter and externally, and we expect to finalize the organizational structure for the new company by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the hard work of separating kidney care from Baxter is ongoing across commercial, legal, regulatory, supply chain and numerous other key operational channels.\nJust like Baxter, post separation, Kidney Care will be positioned to benefit from heightened focus and the ability to pursue its unique investment priorities to serve patients and clinicians drive growth and innovation and create added value for shareholders. With this as context, I wanted to briefly share some perspectives on recent headlines regarding GLP-1s including Novo Nordisk's October announcement about its Foley study and broader speculation about the future of dialysis therapy.\nWe, like the rest of the dialysis community, continue to follow developments closely. And we are eager to see the Foley study results, which are expected to be published in the first half of 2024. Given Baxter's life-sustaining mission, we welcome any new therapeutic approaches that have the potential to improve the lives of patients, particularly those with chronic conditions. We also believe that it's premature to assume that these drugs, particularly given the full trial results have yet to be published, will bring about any material shift in the need for dialysis services from a global market perspective. We believe that dialysis therapy will remain in demand in a critical element of patient care for the foreseeable future.\nLet me highlight a couple of data points that we believe are relevant. The existing data on demographics and disease patterns continue to consistently suggest that the global incidence of end-stage kidney disease or ESKD will continue to rise over the next 15 to 20 years. To provide a bit more context, current data suggests that the global ESKD incidence, overall, will continue to grow, driven by a greater than 35% expected increase in the prevalence of diabetes by 2040.\nAt the same time, global demographic data show that the number of people over 65 years old should be increasing by approximately 75% globally between now and 2040, which is also expected to increase the number of potential patients at risk of developing ESKD. Collectively, these macro changes suggest the global incidence of ESKD is expected to continue to rise over the next 15 to 20 years, even with important innovations in CKD therapeutics.\nWe also believe these new drugs are doing important work in raising the awareness and prevalence of primary care discussions about CKD diagnosis and management. We welcome this focus because better informed and empowered patients drive better preparation for dialysis. And studies have shown that the more informed the patient is about their treatment options, the more likely they are to choose home dialysis over other forms of dialysis when given the option.\nTo that end, we are looking forward to seeing the new study data and understanding how it may provide additional options and benefits for patients with CKD. My excitement for the trajectory of Kidney Care remains high. Our thesis and sense of opportunity for an independent stand-alone Kidney Care business remain unchanged from the day we first announced the spin. This has been a year of investment of transformation of important and sometimes difficult steps taken to strengthen our presence and we define our future. We knew when we first laid out this transformation in January that we had to get it right. And less than a year later, our progress is evident and our path forward is clear.\nWe have delivered on our BPS divestiture. We have implemented our verticalized segment structure, and we are well on our way towards achieving the planned Kidney Care separation. Our continued progress on this transformational journey is a credit to the exceptional hard work and commitment of our Baxter colleagues worldwide, who, as always, have my profound thanks.\nI'm confident that these actions are strongly positioning Baxter and in turn, Kidney Care to unlock meaningful long-term value for all stakeholders.\nNow before we take a closer look at our third quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to recognize Brian Stevens for serving so well as interim CFO for over the past 5 months. We're also pleased to welcome incoming CFO, Joel Grade, whose wide-ranging experience and track record make him an outstanding fit at this time of transformation. I will first hand the call over to Joel for a few introductory comments before Brian then provides a more detailed overview of our results for the quarter.\n\nJoel T. Grade\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sysco Corp.\n\nThanks, Joe. Let me start by saying how excited I am to join all of you today for my first earnings call as Baxter's new CFO, and more importantly, how motivated I am to be joining Baxter during such an important point in its transformational journey. For many years, I've admired Baxter as an iconic company with an incredible mission to save and sustain lives. When the opportunity arose to join the team, I recognize that this is the right next step in my career. The position presented me with the ability to utilize my broad experiences in finance, operations, strategy and transformation to help the company deliver on its strategic actions that Joe outlined earlier. While early, I've been extremely impressed with the talented and dedicated employees at Baxter and their unwavering passion for and commitment to our mission. In addition, I'm very optimistic about the numerous opportunities that exist for the company to increase long-term value for our stakeholders.\nFinally, I look forward to both speaking with and meeting many of you over the next coming months. Your perspective on our business and the surrounding market landscape will be incredibly valuable as we move forward in our transformation journey. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to take us through the Q3 results. Brian, over to you.\n\nBrian Stevens\n\nThanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call this morning to provide some additional details on Baxter's third quarter financial performance as well as commentary on our updated financial outlook. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which came in ahead of our expectations. Third quarter 2023 global sales included $3.71 billion from continuing operations and $191 million from discontinued operations. Sales in the quarter increased 3% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis and compared favorably to our guidance.\nSales performance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales in Medical Products and Therapies, particularly our infusion systems and IV solutions products as well as continued strength in our Pharmaceuticals business, driven by injectables and drug compounding. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.68 a share, decreasing 4% versus the prior year period and reflecting the ongoing operational improvements, primarily offset by the impact of increased interest expense.\nAdjusted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter came in ahead of our expectations of $0.65 to $0.67 per share, primarily driven by sales and operational performance and partially offset by higher-than-expected tax rate. In the aggregate, inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year and totaled $0.82 per share.\nNow walk through the performance by our new reportable segments. Sales in our Medical Products & Therapies segment were $1.26 billion, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Within Medical Products & Therapies, sales from our Infusion Therapies and Technologies division, which includes our 4 Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses totaled $1 billion and increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Sales in the quarter benefited from strong growth in our infusion systems portfolio, driven by continued demand for our infusion pump hardware, including the spectrum LVP. Sales from Advanced Surgery totaled $255 million and grew 3% on a constant currency basis, in line with expectations and surgical procedure growth.\nMoving on to Kidney Care. Sales in the quarter were $1.1 billion and were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $921 million, declining 3% on a constant currency basis. Sales performance in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year period which benefited from certain discrete items that totaled approximately $20 million. In addition, and consistent with our plans to enhance performance in our HD business, sales in the quarter reflect the exit of a distribution agreement in the U.S. earlier this year.\nFinally, performance in Chronic Therapies continues to be impacted by government-based procurement initiatives in China and the lower patient census in the region due to the pandemic. We estimate that collectively, these region-specific factors negatively impacted sales by more than $40 million in the quarter.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, representing growth of 12% on a constant currency basis, with double-digit growth across all regions and reflecting a more stabilized environment for this business following significant heightened demand during the pandemic. For our Healthcare Systems & Technology segment, sales in the quarter were $744 million and were flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis.\nWithin this segment, sales in our Care & Connectivity Solutions division, which includes our former Patient Support Systems and Surgical Solutions businesses were $443 million, decreasing 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by a lower contribution from rental revenues and lower hospital capital spending as compared to the prior year period. Orders within our Care & Connectivity Solutions division continued to improve sequentially, increasing more than 10% as compared to the second quarter.\nFront Line Care sales in the quarter were $301 million, increasing 8% on a constant currency basis and reflecting the continued benefit of easing supply constraints. During the quarter, the business was able to continue to reduce its backlog, and we expect to exit the year with a more normalized backlog level. Sales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $580 million, increasing 9% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter reflected continued strength in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches as well as continued strong demand for our services within our hospital compounding portfolio internationally.\nOther sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities, declined more than 50% during the quarter. This lower level of sales reflects reduced demand in 2023 for certain contract manufacturing volumes and the termination of a royalty arrangement following our acquisition of the rights to the underlying product. BPS third quarter sales reported as discontinued operations, were $191 million, increasing 11% on a constant currency basis.\nNow moving to the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin from continuing operations totaled 41.7% and represented a decline of 70 basis points over the prior year, but improved 130 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline in gross margin reflects the impact of higher costs for raw materials overhead and labor driven by the elevated inflationary impacts we've absorbed over the last couple of years. We were able to partially offset these cost increases through pricing and ongoing margin improvement programs in our integrated supply chain network.\nAdjusted SG&A totaled $820 million or 22.1% of sales, a decrease of 50 basis points versus the prior year period. Performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies, partially offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans compared to the prior year. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter totaled $161 million and represented 4.3% of sales, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year. We have ramped up our R&D efforts particularly increasing our investments in advancing our connected care technologies.\nAnd like SG&A, R&D expenses include the impact of higher employee incentive accruals as compared to the prior period. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a decrease of 50 basis points versus the prior year but a sequential improvement of 200 basis points in operating margin as compared to the second quarter. Operating margin came in ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by top line performance and enhanced execution on our initiatives focused on driving improved operational efficiency.\nNet interest expense totaled $128 million in the quarter, an increase of $24 million versus the prior year, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on our variable rate debt. Adjusted other nonoperating income totaled $7 million in the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year period. Results were unfavorable to expectations driven mostly by losses in foreign exchange.\nThe adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.8% compared to 22% in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease as well as the unfavorability versus expectations was primarily driven by changes in geographic earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.68 and declined 4% versus the prior year, primarily reflecting the increase in cost of goods sold due to inflation as well as higher interest expense and foreign exchange headwinds. With respect to our prior guidance, earnings favorability was driven by better-than-expected sales and operational efficiencies, partially offset by negative impacts from FX and a higher-than-expected tax rate in the quarter.\nTotal company adjusted earnings of $0.82 per diluted share, which includes discontinued operations, was flat versus the prior year period. With respect to cash flow, in the first 9 months of 2023, we've generated free cash flow of $666 million, including discontinued operations, compared to $293 million in the prior year period. And we remain on track to more than double our free cash flow in 2023 from prior year levels.\nNow let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, including some key assumptions underpinning that guidance. For full year 2023, Baxter expects total sales growth from continuing operations of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and approximately 2% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange is expected to be an approximate 50 basis point headwind to reported results on a full year basis. On a continuing operations basis, we expect full year adjusted operating margin of 14.3% to 14.5%. With the closing of the BPS transaction and related debt payout, we expect a reduction of net interest expense of approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $450 million.\nWe anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate of 20.5% to 21%. And lastly, we expect diluted average share count of 508 million shares. We now expect full year adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.57 to $2.60 per share.\nSpecific to the fourth quarter of 2023 we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% to 2% on a reported basis and approximately 1% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.85 to $0.88 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trackman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Stevens, Baxter Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2023 financial results along with our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2023. Please note, results in the current period and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the pending sale of our biopharma solutions or BPS business.\nWhile the closing of this transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. That business is now reported as a discontinued operation. We have posted restated schedules reflecting that presentation for prior periods to our IR website. In addition, we will be providing a walk to reconcile our prior guidance for full year 2023 for updated financial outlook for continuing operations and in the aggregate.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2023, new product development including the impact of pending regulatory approvals; the potential impact of our in-flight strategic and pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters, in the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on continuing supply game challenges and evolving customer capital spending contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nAnd of course, our actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Sector's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's call. I will begin with an overview of Baxter's second quarter 2023 performance followed by a look at the progress we're making across the strategic actions we announced earlier this year. I will then turn it over to our interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, Brian Stevens, who will walk you through our quarterly performance and outlook in more detail. Finally, as always, we will welcome your questions.\nSecond quarter sales rose 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis both measures exceeding our prior guidance of 1% to 2% and 2% to 3%, respectively. As a reminder, and as Clare noted, we are reporting results of our biopharma solutions or BPS contract manufacturing business as discontinued operations in light of its pending sale which I will touch on shortly. I would note there was no impact in the quarter on top line growth rates from discontinued operations on either a reported or constant currency basis.\nOur top line outperformance was driven by solid demand across the portfolio. On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $0.55 a and discontinued operations totaled $0.11. In the aggregate, adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.66 and exceeded our outlook range of $0.59 to $0.61 and driven by a combination of top line performance and operational efficiencies. Several factors combined to help bolster both top line and bottom line results. First and foremost, I want to highlight positive demand and greater stability across most corners of the health care marketplace.\nFollowing the erratic impact of the pandemic and its recurrent surges over the past few years. Overall, we are continuing to see sustained recovery in hospital admissions and procedural volumes as well as in alternate sites of care, which are contributing to solid performance across the portfolio. The more stable inflationary environment is also contributing to an improved macroeconomic backdrop, further helping to steady our operational performance. while positive signs are emerging, we remain cognizant of the potential for inflationary disruptions consistent with our approach this year.\nAnd in general, we have tried to capture these potential risks in our updated financial outlook. Similar with last quarter, we are also seeing continued improvements in availability of key electromechanical components. This reflects a combination of overall environmental impacts and steps we have taken to shore up supply within our own integrated supply chain operations while there is still work to do with these factors and actions are contributing to enhanced cost management and greater predictability on the supply chain front.\nAs we have previously commented, we continue to see a degree of cost in hospital capital spending, which has impacted our patient support systems or PSS performance, Encouragingly, we saw a significant sequential improvement in the second quarter for orders and are building momentum with the recent launches of our Progressa plus ICU bed and enhanced features to our segment-leading Centrella band. [indiscernible] is the latest version of our unique ICU focused bed which now offers a range of additional features developed to help health care professionals address the complex critical needs of ICU patients. Our current expectation is for hospital capital spending to improve in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year as hospitals reevaluate their budgets and reprioritize areas of spend. We are building momentum and making significant progress across the transformative strategic actions we announced to kick off 2023. The proposed spin-off of our renal care and acute therapies businesses into an independent publicly traded company, the pending sale of our BPS business and the implements for the remainder [Audio Gap] progress, these efforts are already enhancing strategic clarity across the company, increasing account [Audio Gap]\n\nBrian C. Stevens\n\nSenior VP, Interim CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Controller\n\nJoe mentioned, we are pleased with our second quarter results, which came in ahead of our expectations. Second quarter 2023 global sales included $3.71 million from continuing operations and $142 million from discontinued operations. Sales in the quarter increased 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis and compared favorably to our guidance. Sales performance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales across nearly every business line with particular outperformance realized in Medication Delivery, Pharmaceuticals and patient support systems. On a year-over-year basis, we recognized solid growth across much of the portfolio, which was partially offset by a 1% decline in Patient Support Systems, primarily reflecting lower rental revenues and reduced hospital capital spending as compared to prior periods.\nWe also generated lower sales in BPS, which is now reported in discontinued operations due to a reduction in revenues from COVID vaccine manufacturing. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings in the aggregate, inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, decreased 24% to $0.66 and reflecting the impact on our results of the increased cost of materials, labor and freight we've absorbed due to the significant inflationary environment experienced over the past few years. Adjusted EPS for the quarter came in ahead of expectations of $0.59 to $0.61 per share, primarily driven by sales and operational performance.\nA lower-than-expected tax rate offset the negative impacts from foreign exchange and losses on equity investments. Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories, starting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas grew 5% compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 3% on a constant currency basis, and sales in our APAC region increased 4% constant currency. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect performance in APAC to be negatively impacted by a decline in China sales resulting from the effect of excess mortality on ESRD patient volumes due to the pandemic as well as the impact from the ongoing implementation of value-based procurement initiatives.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal Care were $936 million increasing 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth in our U.S. PD business, partially offset by lower U.S. in-center HD sales following the exit of a distribution agreement at the end of last year consistent with our optimization plans for this business. Globally, both PD and in-center HD sales advanced low single digits. Results in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales in China due to the factors just mentioned, including government-based procurement initiatives and the lower patient census in the region due to the pandemic.\nSales in Medication Delivery of $761 million grew 7% year-over-year at constant currency rates, driven by strength globally for both infusion systems and IV solutions products. We continue to experience healthy demand in the U.S. for our Spectrum LVP pump. As we continue to work to improve the availability of components for spectrum, we expect sales to ramp in the second half of the year, and we also continue to focus on growing our Novan syringe base. Pharmaceutical sales of $550 million increased 6% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter reflected strength in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches, including Zosen, [indiscernible] room temperature and bendamustine as well as increased sales internationally for our hospital compounding portfolio.\nTotal sales for Clinical Nutrition were $243 million, increasing 7% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by a strong performance internationally, partially offset by declines in the U.S., reflecting a difficult comparison against the prior year period. Sales in Advanced Surgery were $272 million, advancing 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflects an improvement of surgical procedures globally with particular strength internationally partially offset by the impact from exiting a distribution agreement in the U.S. as well as select supply constraints that hampered performance in the quarter.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $180 million, representing growth of 6% on a constant currency basis and represented a return to growth in the U.S. and strength in our APAC region. Sales in our Patient Support Systems business were $359 million, decreasing 1% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by lower contribution from rental revenues and lower hospital capital spending as compared to the prior year period. In the quarter, we realized better-than-expected sales for ICU beds in the U.S., driven by the launch of Progressive Plus.\nWe have experienced positive demand for that new entrant to our smart bed portfolio since its debut. As Joe mentioned, we saw a significant sequential improvement in orders, increasing approximately 30% and driven by demand for our segment-leading hospital beds and care communications products. We currently expect this momentum to continue with orders increasing in the second half of the year as compared to the first half. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $307 million, increasing 9% on a constant currency basis.\nThis growth reflects demand for our intelligent diagnostics, respiratory health and connected monitoring portfolios. We saw continued improvement in supply availability of electromechanical components during the quarter, which enabled us to address a portion of the backlog associated with the Front Line Care business. While we are pleased to see improvements in our supply constraints, the business continues to have an elevated backlog level, which we will continue to work down over the course of the year as anticipated demand remains strong for this portfolio of products.\nGlobal Surgical Solutions sales in the quarter were $77 million, increasing 9% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by continued geographic expansion and increased hospital access. BPS second quarter sales, which are now reported as discontinued operations, were $142 million, decreasing 7% on a constant currency basis. This decline was in line with expectations due to lower COVID vaccine-related revenues of approximately $27 million compared to the prior year period. Underlying business momentum continues to build with strong growth, excluding the vaccine impact realized in the quarter.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin from continuing operations totaled 40.4% in line with our expectations and represented a decline of 160 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year decrease reflects increased cost of goods sold, primarily driven by material and labor inflation, freight and supply constraints partially offset by favorable pricing in select areas of the portfolio. The impact of discontinued operations reduced Q2 2023 adjusted gross margins by 40 basis points and Q2 2022 adjusted gross margins by 50 basis points.\nAdjusted SG&A totaled $844 million or 22.8% as a percentage of sales, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies, partially offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans versus the prior year. On an aggregate basis, inclusive of discontinued operations, adjusted SG&A was 22.1% as a percentage of sales in Q2 '23 and 22.4% as a percentage of sales in Q2 '22.\nAdjusted R&D spending in the quarter totaled $165 million and represented 4.5% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 40 basis points versus the prior year. We have ramped up our R&D efforts, particularly increasing our investments in advancing our connected care technologies on an aggregate basis, inclusive of discontinued operations, adjusted R&D was 4.3% as a percentage of sales in Q2 '23 and 4.0% as a percentage of sales in Q2 of '22. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 13.2% and a decrease of 150 basis points versus the prior year.\nOn an aggregate basis, inclusive of discontinued operations adjusted operating margin was 14.4% as a percentage of sales in Q2 of '23 and 16.2% as a percentage of sales in Q2 of '22. Operating margin came in ahead of our expectations primarily driven by top line performance and enhanced execution on our transformational initiatives driving improved operational efficiency. Net interest expense totaled $124 million in the quarter, an increase of $35 million versus the prior year, driven by the impact of increased interest rates on our variable rate debt.\nAdjusted other nonoperating expense totaled $22 million in the quarter compared to $33 million of income in the prior year period. Results were unfavorable to expectations and driven by losses in both foreign exchange and marketable securities compared to gains in the prior year. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.8% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period.\nThe year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by changes in geographic earnings mix. With respect to cash flow, in the first half of 2023, we generated free cash flow of $485 million, including discontinued operations compared to $171 million in the prior year period. we expect to remain on track to more than double our free cash flow year-over-year in 2023. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.55 and declined 25% versus the prior year.\nAdjusted earnings, including discontinued operations of $0.66 per diluted share declined 24% versus the prior year period, reflecting the increased cost of raw materials freight and labor as well as the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt, foreign exchange headwinds and higher bonus accruals. With respect to our original guidance, earnings favorability was driven by better-than-expected sales and SG&A savings as the benefit from the lower tax rate offset the negative impacts from FX and losses on marketable securities.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2023, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. As mentioned, we are pleased with the operational performance to date and positive momentum we have seen through the first half of the year. While we continue to work to mitigate the macroeconomic challenges that have impacted our results to date, the latest signs are reassuring. Our business fundamentals remain solid and demand for the portfolio is broad-based. Taking into account our positive second quarter results, I'll now walk through our updated guidance.\nOur current expectation is that the pending sale of VPS is likely to close towards the end of the third quarter. However, as the ultimate timing of completion is uncertain, we are providing adjusted operating margin and EPS guidance for full year 2023 that contemplates 2 scenarios, 1 where the deal does not close in 2023 and another that assumes it closes at the end of the third quarter. For full year 2023, Baxter now expects total sales growth from continuing operations of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and approximately 2% on a constant currency basis. We now expect foreign exchange to be a 50 basis point headwind to reported results on a full year basis.\nAssuming that BPS were to remain a part of Baxter through year-end 2023, our outlook for sales growth in the aggregate, including discontinued operations, would be the same as continuing operations growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. If BPS were to remain a part of Baxter through year-end, we will continue to expect full year adjusted operating margin in the aggregate, including discontinued operations, of 15.5% to 16%. On a continuing operations basis, we expect full year adjusted operating margin of 14.1% to 14.6% and which would not be significantly impacted by the timing of the pending BPS closure.\nIf the pending BPS transaction does not close by year-end, we would expect to incur interest expense of approximately $500 million for fiscal 2023. However, if the BPS transaction closes by the end of September as currently anticipated, we would expect a reduction of interest expense of approximately $40 million, which would result in a benefit to continuing operations in the fourth quarter. We now anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate of 20.5% to 21% on both an aggregate and continuing operations basis. Given current foreign exchange rates, we expect to absorb a negative earnings impact of $0.05 to $0.07 per share in the second half of the year relative to prior expectations.\nLastly, we expect a diluted average share count of 508 million shares. Under this scenario, where BPS remains a part of Baxter through year-end 2023, we now expect 2023 adjusted earnings on an aggregate basis, including discontinued operations to total $2.92 to $3 per diluted share, which includes adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.49 to $2.57 and adjusted earnings from discontinued operations of $0.43. If the pending BPS sale were to close at the end of the third quarter as currently anticipated, we would expect full year adjusted earnings in the aggregate, including discontinued operations of $2.87 to $2.95 per diluted share, adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.54 to $2.62 and adjusted earnings from discontinued operations of $0.33.\nThis outlook excludes estimated fourth quarter adjusted earnings attributed to BPS consistent with the assumed September 30 closing date and includes a benefit of approximately $0.05, primarily due to reduced interest expense after giving effect to the anticipated debt repayment plan associated with closing of the pending BPS sale. Specific to the third quarter of 2023, we expect global sales growth from continuing operations of approximately 2% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis and we expect adjusted earnings from continuing operations, excluding special items, of $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share.\nWe expect adjusted earnings of $0.13 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Taking this into account, we would expect adjusted earnings in aggregate of $0.78 to $0.80 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter 2023 financial results, along with our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023, new product developments, the potential impact of our in-flight proposed strategic and pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters and the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on anticipated customer capital spending, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nAnd of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJosé E. Almeida\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join today's call. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter performance and trajectory. Jay will follow with a closer look at our financials as well as our outlook for Q2 and the remainder of 2023. After that, we will open up the lines for Q&A.\nFirst quarter sales declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and rose 2% at a constant currency, exceeding our original outlook, driven primarily by better-than-expected sales in Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals and Front Line Care.\nOn the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 also came in above our guidance range of $0.46 to $0.50 per share, again, driven primarily by operational performance in the quarter.\nResults in the quarter were impacted by the expected declines in two of our legacy Baxter businesses. Biopharma Solutions and Acute Therapies, reflecting the tough comparisons to the prior year period due to COVID.\nLooking at our legacy Hillrom businesses. Strength in Front Line Care and Global Surgical Solutions was offset by a decline in Patient Support Systems, or PSS performance. This reflects what we believe to be softness in certain hospital capital spending patterns in the current economic environment.\nFollowing what I will candidly describe as a difficult 2022, we begin 2023 with a solid quarter and on a strong footing for future momentum. From a macroeconomic perspective, while the high rates of inflation we absorbed last year continued to impact our performance, most notably in the first half of the year, we are beginning to see more stability in the overall market.\nWe are also starting to see an improvement on the supply chain front, which includes the increased availability of electromechanical components, creating more predictability in our operations in a reduced need for premium cost spot purchasing.\nSpecifically, in terms of the health care marketplace, admissions and procedural volumes continue to recover from pandemic lows, contributing to positive demand. We also continue to see steady improvement in PD patient growth in many markets following several quarters of this lower demand linked to pandemic-related mortality issues.\nIn another crucial signal, health care staffing levels have stabilized or are rising at hospitals and other facilities following some concerning lows. With that said, we believe, based on conversations with our U.S. customers, the hospital capital spending has been deprioritized for certain product areas, which has impacted near-term performance of our PSS business.\nOur current expectation is that the situation starts to improve over the course of the year. We're nearing the launch of our next version of our market-leading ICU beds, Progressa+. Progressa+ is the only true ICU bed with new features to help clinical staff address complications and provide the best care possible for patients. We are already seeing strong customer interest in the new solution and look forward to the anticipated launch this quarter.\nLastly, regarding this topic, I will highlight that we are not currently seeing the softness in capital spending extend to our other businesses, such as Infusion Systems or Front Line Care, where demand remains strong for the products.\nAlongside these trends, we are, of course, moving full speed ahead on the critical strategic initiatives I announced at the outset of the year, focused on enhancing our impact and long-term shareholder value.\nOur plan to spin off our Renal Care and Acute Therapies business into a stand-alone Kidney Care company is well underway. The stand-alone company will emerge as a leader in a growing market segment with 2022 sales of approximately $4.5 billion and more than 1 million patients across more than 70 countries.\nYou will hold leading positions across its portfolio and a well-established presence in homes, hospitals and clinics worldwide. Perhaps most importantly, as a stand-alone entity, it will benefit from increased management focus and the pursuit of its unique investment priorities, better positioned to accelerate growth and innovation, emphasizing its distinct market drivers.\nWe are finalizing our search process to identify the future CEO of our spin-off company and hope to share more information on this front shortly.\nWe currently expect the spin-off Kidney Care to occur by July 2024 or earlier, and we'll continue to keep you informed of our progress.\nLast week marked the initial launch phase of the new operating model we previewed for you last quarter, realigning our current portfolio of 10 businesses into four vertically integrated global business segments. Each segment is being led by an experienced, passionate senior executive with a proven track record of success and compelling vision for the future.\nMedical Products and Therapies, led by Group President, Heather Knight, comprises our current medication delivery, Advanced Surgery and Clinical Nutrition portfolios.\nHealthcare Systems and Technologies led by Group President, Reaz Rasul, includes our legacy Hillrom businesses, including Patient Support Systems, Global Surgical Solutions and Front Line Care.\nPharmaceuticals, led by Group President, Alok Sonig, includes our current Pharma portfolio as well as our BioPharma Solutions business. And finally, Kidney Care comprises our Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses.\nEach of these segments has global profit and loss accountability, dedicated commercial operations and fully aligned research and development, manufacturing, supply chain and functional support teams. Note that our global manufacturing sites are being aligned to each business to help fuel greater transparency, foresight and resilience across the supply chain.\nWhile we are in the early stage of this implementation, our teams are moving fast, eager to capitalize on the tighter alignment that can help fuel enhanced strategic clarity, agility and innovation.\nEven as we advance organizational and efficiency efforts, we also know that high-impact innovation is a critical factor to delivering accelerated growth among recent innovation milestones.\nWe're very pleased to share that we have resubmitted our leading-edge Novum IQ large volume pump for FDA 510(k) clearance. The Novum IQ syringe pump is now in use in the United States. As a reminder, we have not included any U.S. sales for the Novum IQ LVP in our guidance.\nI'm also pleased to report that our newly launched Zosyn premix is experiencing solid uptake in the U.S. hospital pharma marketplace. Other recent launches include Baxter's new patient warming system, which minimizes risks associated with forced air warming, reduces noise and waste in the operating room and lessens the burden on clinician workflows.\nFloseal + Recothrom, the first and only active flowable hemostat with a recombinant thrombin, resulting in 1.5x faster preparation ReadyConnect System for Baxter's Centrella Smart+ Bed, which delivers reliable cable-free connectivity between the hospital bed and most nurse-call systems on the market.\nAnd finally, ExactaMix Pro, the next-generation automated nutrition compounder designed to enhance security and improve customer experience and offer stronger data reporting capabilities.\nLooking ahead, while macro environmental factors show signs of improvement, we remain cautious and balanced about the pace of recovery. This is why our current transformational initiatives are so vital.\nOur goal is to redefine our operations for sustained success in a rapidly evolving environment, while always remaining true to our life sustaining mission and focus on medically essential health care.\nOur momentum today and tomorrow is fueled entirely by our employees. I thank them for their dedication and resilience, which are vital to the transformation journey we are taking together.\nNow I will pass it on to Jay for a closer look at our performance and outlook.\n\nJames K. Saccaro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Baxter International, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results, which came in ahead of our previous guidance range.\nFirst quarter 2023 global sales of $3.6 billion declined 2% on a reported basis and increased 2% on a constant currency basis. This compared favorably to our guidance, which called for constant currency sales to decline approximately 1%.\nAs mentioned earlier, sales performance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales in Renal Care and Pharmaceuticals as well as Front Line Care, which have reflected improvement in availability of electromechanical components.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings decreased 37% to $0.59 per share, reflecting the increased cost we've recognized due to the significant inflationary impacts on materials, labor and freight, along with certain supply chain constraints.\nAdjusted EPS for the quarter also came in ahead of our expectations of $0.46 to $0.50 per share, driven by improved operational performance and a benefit from lower-than-expected interest expense.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Starting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas declined 1% compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis.\nSales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad-based recovery in hospital admissions and surgical procedures across the region.\nAnd sales in our APAC region increased 3% constant currency. APAC sales reflected strength across the region, offset by a decline in China due to the impact from various government-based procurement initiatives being implemented in that market.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal Care were $892 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis.\nPerformance in the quarter was driven by mid-single-digit growth globally in our PD business, partially offset by lower U.S. in-center HD sales following the exit of a distribution agreement at the end of last year. Results in the quarter also reflected the negative impact from ongoing government-based procurement initiatives in China.\nSales in Medication Delivery of $687 million were flat year-over-year at constant currency rates. Strong international growth in Solutions was offset by lower infusion system sales. As mentioned, we've resubmitted our Novum IQ large-volume pump for FDA 510(k) clearance.\nIn the meantime, we continue to promote our Spectrum IQ LVP, which has been impacted by supply constraints for electromechanical components. Our teams have been and will continue to work diligently to secure additional parts to meet customer demand for the Spectrum IQ large-volume pump.\nPharmaceutical sales of $523 million increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter reflected increased demand for our drug compounding portfolio internationally as well as double-digit growth in our U.S. injectables portfolio. This helped offset lower sales internationally for injectables.\nMoving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $224 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our nutrition compounding services.\nSales in Advanced Surgery were $246 million, advancing 11% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflects an improvement of elective procedures globally. Surgical volume recovery was strong across all regions.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $180 million, declining 1% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year, where we had experienced elevated demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases.\nBioPharma Solutions in the quarter were $139 million, decreasing 9% on a constant currency basis. This decline was in line with expectations due to lower COVID vaccine-related revenues of approximately $35 million compared to the prior year period last year.\nSales in our Patient Support Systems business were $348 million, decreasing 8% on a constant currency basis. As Joe mentioned earlier, we believe performance in this business has been impacted by a slowdown in capital spending with respect to certain product categories.\nIn addition, this business is experiencing lower rental revenues as compared to the prior year period. For the year, we expect growth will continue to be dampened by these factors, but we expect our order rate to improve over the course of the year.\nIn addition, our backlog remains elevated and to date, we have not had any material cancellations. We're excited to launch Progressa+ this quarter and expect it to positively contribute to future performance.\nFront Line Care sales in the quarter were $302 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. This reflects demand for our intelligent diagnostics portfolio. We saw a slight improvement in supply availability of electromechanical components during the quarter, which enabled us to address a portion of the backlog associated with the Front Line Care business.\nWhile we're pleased to see improvement in our supply constraints, the business continues to have an elevated backlog level, which we hope to continue to work down over the course of the year as anticipated demand remains strong for this business.\nGlobal Surgical Solutions sales in the quarter were $81 million, increasing 8% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by increased international placements in the quarter.\nMoving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 41.2% decreased 380 basis points over the prior year, reflecting cost of goods sold, primarily driven by the factors we've discussed around material and labor inflation, freight and supply chain constraints.\nAdjusted SG&A of $845 million represent 23.2% of sales, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year period, reflecting higher annual employee-based compensation accruals.\nAdjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $157 million represented $4.3 million as a percent of sales, an increase of 30 basis points versus prior year, as we increased our investments in innovation, particularly around advancing our connected care technologies. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 13.8%, a decrease of 420 basis points versus the prior year.\nNet interest expense totaled $117 million in the quarter, an increase of $32 million versus the prior year, driven by the impact of increased interest rates on variable rate debt.\nOther nonoperating income totaled $1 million in the quarter compared to $16 million of income in the prior year period. Results in the quarter reflect a benefit from the amortization of pension benefits as well as an equity gain, which we were offset by foreign exchange losses.\nThe adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 20.8% in the prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by a change in stock-based compensation impacts. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share declined 37% versus the prior year period.\nEarnings in the quarter reflected the increased cost of raw materials, freight and labor as well as the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and foreign exchange headwinds.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance.\nAs mentioned, we're pleased with the solid start to the year, after the challenging macroeconomic environment we experienced in '22, the challenges of which we continue to address.\nOur business fundamentals are solid, and we're seeing positive trends externally. We're cautiously optimistic and continue to work to position ourselves to see improved performance in the years ahead, and we remain steadfastly focused on execution.\nTaking into account first quarter results, I'll now walk through our guidance and expectations. For full year 2023, we expect global sales growth of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and approximately 1% growth on a constant currency basis.\nWe now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be between 15.5% and 16%. Interest expense is now expected to total approximately $500 million. We continue to anticipate an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% and a diluted average share count of 508 million shares. Based on these dynamics, we expect 2023 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.85 to $3 per diluted share.\nSpecific to the second quarter of 2023, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% to 2% on a reported basis, 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.59 to $0.61 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

Joe?\n\nJose E. Almeida\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with a brief overview of Baxter's performance for the quarter and year, and then provide some additional information on the strategic road map we announced on January 6. These actions, further outlined in this morning's press release, will help Baxter to emerge as a more agile, innovative market responsive enterprise with expanded opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. Jay will follow with a deeper dive on our 2022 results and outlook for 2023, and we will close with Q&A.\nStarting with our financial results. Sales for the fourth quarter 2022 were $3.9 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis, 17% at constant currency and 2% on an operational basis. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 came in below our expectations, primarily driven by foreign exchange losses and product mix in the quarter. For the full year sales of $15.1 billion advanced 18% on a reported basis, 23% at constant currency and 2% on an operational basis.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the year were $3.50. Jay will provide more granularity on the numbers, but some themes are clear. Demand across our portfolio remains solid and sales rose across the majority of our legacy Baxter and Hillrom businesses, offsetting modest or expected declines in others, driven by factors such as generic competition or challenging year-over-year comparisons.\nAs we've discussed previously, this top line growth was offset by weighing of macroeconomic and supply chain factors that has continued to put pressure on the cost of doing business. And as I have stressed many times, we will never pursue reduced costs in ways that could compromise our fundamental mission to save and sustain lives. But even factoring in these headwinds, we did not perform at the level we expected and demand of ourselves.\nAnd our ability to advance our mission is grounded, first and foremost, in our capacity to deliver steady, solid performance as a sustainable corporate enterprise. This is precisely why, earlier this year, we announced plans to accelerate our transformation journey, the actions we announced on January 6, and are expanding on today are as necessary as they are timely.\nAs I shared in January, we spent the latter part of 2022 undertaking a comprehensive review of our operations focused keenly on opportunities to improve our commercial responsiveness, reinvigorate our innovation engine and streamline our operations. This work led to last month's announcement of our intention to spin off a new kidney care company, explore options for our BioPharma Solutions contract manufacturing business and implement a new operating model for our remaining Baxter businesses. These are 3 distinct initiatives with a single agenda, increase stakeholder impact with improved long-term shareholder value.\nCutting across these actions are common goals, enhancing refining strategic clarity, increased accountability and line of sight, enhance agility and bring our global businesses even closer to the patients, clinicians and customers they serve. Today, I will share the next level of detail on the Baxter business model, we expect to begin implementing next quarter.\nThis work entails a fundamental reconfiguration of how we operate and deliver products to the customers and markets we serve. This new operating model is focused on 4 vertically integrated global business units, or GBUs, grouped along general therapeutic areas encompassing multiple sites of care. These GBUs, which will become Baxter's core operating and reporting segments when implemented, include medical products and therapies, comprising our current Medication Delivery, Advanced Surgery and Clinical Nutrition portfolios.\nHealthcare Systems and Technologies comprising our legacy. Hillrom businesses, including Patient Support Systems, Global Surgical Solutions and Front Line Care, pharmaceuticals, which will include our current pharma portfolio as well as our BioPharma Solutions business until its potential separation. And finally, Kidney Care comprising our current Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses to reiterate our intention subject to satisfaction of customary conditions used to spin Kidney Care into an independent publicly traded company in the next 12 to 18 months. Until then, this GBU will benefit from the strategic work we are doing right now helping to hone a well-focused and streamlined entity in preparation for its anticipated launch as a stand-alone company.\nIn this way, we can think of Baxter as having 4 GBU structure, or perhaps a 3 plus 1 GBU structure once the model is in place later this year. Each new GBU will have its own President, reporting directly to me. Each will have full global P&L accountability. We will begin to realign our current 3 region global commercial structures. So the global commercial teams will report directly into each GBU.\nThe dedicated R&D manufacturing and supply chain and functional support teams will also be embedded by GBU to optimize visibility and oversight. This restructure is designed to generate more direct, clear accountability across each business and promote more agile decision-making across sales, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and innovation.\nSo what you see upon completion of this process is that each of the GBUs will have more autonomy and agility than the current businesses do today. GBUs will be able to respond to market dynamics faster, more effectively, accelerate commercial investments, design and produce products and prioritize R&D spending, all to help meet critical market needs and accelerate business performance.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, Baxter will become more nimble with manufacturing sites mapped directly to each GBU leading to an optimized manufacturing footprint in a more resilient supply chain. Preparation for the new operating model is already surfacing opportunities for streamlining and efficiency that are intended to further bolster bottom line performance. The redesign being contemplated, coupled with additional actions the company has undertaken to enhance performance, are expect to deliver more than $300 million in total savings during 2023 and a workforce reduction of less than 5%. We plan to begin implementing our new operating model early in the second quarter.\nLooking ahead to 2023. More broadly, we expect to continue navigating a challenging operational environment, hand-in-hand with our transformation effort. We have been taking a hard look at our forecasting models and processes as we reflect on our performance last year and the lessons learned in an era of unprecedented macroeconomic challenges.\nWe have taken the stance of incorporating more financial downside risks into our financial outlook for 2023. Jay will provide additional details on our outlook and various assumptions included.\nBefore I pass it out to Jay, I want to close by reinforcing my confidence and optimism for the future in our commitment to continue to maintain the important work we do every day. Baxter holds a fundamental place in global health care, with a durable portfolio of essential products, market-leading position and passionate employees who bring our mission to life.\nWe're setting out on a well-considered plan to redefine our operations and potential in pursuit of incremental long-term value for the stakeholders and shareholders that rely on us. 2023 now becomes a pivotal year. We are on our way to creating -- to leading health care companies with robust portfolios and strong market momentum. We look forward to sharing our progress and performance in the quarters to come.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Jay.\n\nJames K. Saccaro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Despite in line sales results, our fourth quarter earnings performance came in below our expectations. This variance was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses and product mix in the quarter.\nAs Joe mentioned, we're not satisfied with our results, and as such, we're taking a number of actions to improve our performance. Some of these initiatives are already underway and will be further enhanced with the cost reduction program that we are in the process of finalizing, in parallel with our operating model redesign. These actions are necessary and are expected to accelerate future performance.\nCollectively, these actions are expected to deliver more than $300 million in savings in 2023.\nTurning to our financial performance. Fourth quarter 2022 global sales of $3.9 billion, advanced 11% on a reported basis, 17% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally. Sales performance in the quarter continues to underscore the strength of our broad portfolio of core therapy and connected care offerings across the care continuum.\nAs we've discussed previously, supply for select products remains constrained, and we estimate that these constraints impacted our revenues by approximately $50 million in the quarter or approximately 140 basis points. These supply constraints are a mixture of electromechanical components and shortages from other third-party suppliers.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings decreased 15% to $0.88 per share outside our guidance range of $0.92 to $0.99 per share.\nAs mentioned earlier, this was due to unfavorable product mix and an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange losses on balance sheet positions, primarily due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble during the quarter.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Note that constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, in Baxter's 3 legacy geographic regions.\nStarting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas were flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales in our APAC region increased 2% constant currency.\nQuarterly sales in the region reflected strength in geographic segment sales offset by relatively flat growth in China due to the impact from various government-based procurement initiatives being implemented in that market.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal were $981 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by solid growth in our PD business, where we observed an increase in PD patients globally, particularly in the U.S., which saw a sequential improvement in growth of 100 basis points and ended the year with patient growth of approximately 4%.\nMid-single-digit PD growth in the quarter benefited from incremental revenues of nearly $20 million, resulting from a customer that was looking to build out a new business and did not meet its contractual minimum purchase requirements. This arrangement has been terminated and the related revenues will not recur in future periods.\nPerformance in the quarter was partially offset by lower in-center HD sales due to HD monitor and associated consumable component supply challenges. Sales in Medication Delivery of $745 million declined 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was affected by a difficult comparison to the prior year, which benefited from higher levels of infusion pump placements.\nDemand remains strong for Baxter's smart infusion pumps, and as we have discussed, is currently outpacing our ability to supply, given continued challenges sourcing components. Our IV therapy portfolio grew low single digits globally, driven by strong demand internationally. During the quarter, we did not see pronounced impact from flu-related cases, which, although reported case numbers were high, did not translate into increased hospital admissions.\nPharmaceutical sales of $552 million declined 1% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter reflects the continued impact of generic competition in the U.S., which was partially offset by increased demand for our drug compounding portfolio internationally.\nMoving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $243 million, increasing 6% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our broad multi-chamber bags and vitamins product portfolio. Sales in Advanced Surgery were $260 million, advancing 8% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflects an improvement of electric procedures globally. Surgical volume recovery was strong across all regions.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $182 million, declining 3% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a tough comparison to the prior year, where we had experienced elevated demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases. BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $153 million, increasing 12% on a constant currency basis. Demand for non-COVID services more than offset the decline in COVID vaccine-related revenue compared to the same period last year. COVID vaccine sales for the quarter totaled $22 million.\nLegacy Hillrom contributed $734 million in sales in the quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year period after the acquisition closed on December 13, 2021. Hillrom sales included $360 million of sales in Patient Support Systems, $293 million of sales in Front Line Care and $81 million of sales in Global Surgical Solutions. Legacy Hillrom sales grew mid-single digits on a pro forma and FX-neutral basis as compared to Q4 2021.\nThis growth reflects demand for the physical assessment and cardiology portfolios within the Front Line Care business. Within the quarter, we were able to secure some additional electromechanical components on the spot market, which enabled us to address a portion of the backlog associated with the Front Line Care business.\nSales in Patient Support Systems declined low single digits in the quarter, primarily driven by lower rental revenues in the quarter as the prior year period benefited from more than $10 million in sales due to COVID-related rentals.\nMoving through the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 41.6% decreased 270 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting increased cost of goods sold, primarily driven by the factors we've discussed around inflation, freight and supply chain constraints. Adjusted SG&A of $797 million represented 20.5 as a percentage of sales, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as higher freight expenses.\nAdjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $157 million represented 4% of sales, an increase of 10 basis points versus prior year. Both SG&A and adjusted R&D reflected a benefit from lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans, which are directly tied to Baxter's performance. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 17.1%, a decrease of 310 basis points versus the prior year.\nAdjusted net interest expense totaled $117 million in the quarter, an increase of $73 million versus the prior year, driven by higher outstanding debt balances related to the acquisition of Hillrom and the impact of interest rates on the variable rate debt. Adjusted other nonoperating expense totaled $12 million in the quarter, a decrease of $9 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by amortization of pension benefits. As I mentioned earlier, nonoperating expenses were unfavorable to our expectations primarily due to foreign exchange losses.\nThe adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16.1% compared to 18.6% in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by statute expirations on certain tax positions, partially offset by an increase due to a change in geographic earnings mix following the Hillrom acquisition. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share declined 15% versus the prior year period. Earnings in the quarter reflected the increase of cost of raw materials, freight and labor as well as the impact of rising interest rates and foreign exchange headwinds.\nTurning to full year 2022. Sales of $15.1 billion increased by 18% on a reported basis, 23% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally. Legacy Hillrom's Front Line Care, Patient Support Systems and Global Surgical Solutions businesses contributed $2.9 billion to full year sales on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis and after adjusting for foreign exchange, full year legacy Hillrom sales were flat as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the impact of supply constraints for electromechanical components.\nOn the bottom line, Baxter's adjusted earnings decreased 3% to $3.50 per diluted share, reflecting the impacts we just highlighted. On a full year basis, we generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $532 million. Throughout 2022, we remain focused on debt repayment following our Hillrom acquisition with 900 million paid boards deleveraging. We also returned approximately $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs we execute on our strategic actions outlined in the beginning of 2023, we are first and foremost committed to meaningfully improving our cash flow generation. Our priorities for cash deployment are focused on accelerating debt repayment, maintaining our dividend and resuming share repurchases over time. We are also actively pursuing strategic alternatives for our BioPharma Solutions business, while continuing to assess additional inorganic growth factors for products, therapies and connected care platforms for our new streamlined operations.\nAs we progress towards the proposed spin-off of Kidney Care company, we'll look to utilize proceeds from these actions to accelerate Baxter's debt repayment schedule. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating profile, including taking actions towards achieving our previously stated commitment to achieve 2.75x net leverage. Although current business conditions might challenge our ability to satisfy that commitment, by the end of 2024, we do expect to make significant progress towards achieving the target during 2023 and 2024.\nAdditionally, given the proposed spin-off and potential sale of BPS, we expect to provide additional information regarding our forward-looking outlook for both Baxter RemainCo and KidneyCo at a Capital Markets Day prior to completion of the proposed spin-off.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, including some key assumptions underpinning our guidance. On the top line, 2023 is expected to benefit from underlying volume growth, the pricing actions taken last year as well as new product launches across our GBUs. Some of these new planned product introductions include more than 5 injectable drug launches, a next-gen ICU bed, ExactaMix Pro, Nutrition Compounder, continued rollout of our Novum IQ LVP and syringe pump in Canada and launch of the Novum IQ syringe pump in the U.S.\nAt this time, our 2023 guidance does not contemplate any U.S. revenues for the Novum IQ large-volume infusion pump. We anticipate submission of our final responses to FDA within the quarter. We continue to be very excited about the prospect of this launch and the benefits it offers our customers. Our objective remains to launch this pump in 2023.\nThroughout 2022, demand for our products and therapies remained solid, but supply chain challenges impacted our ability to fully supply this demand. We experienced record levels of backorders and backlog, particularly for the legacy Hillrom business. And while we observed positive development and supply availability in the fourth quarter of 2022, we currently anticipate component availability will remain challenging and will continue to hamper top line sales in 2023. We are working relentlessly to secure components and address order backlog, and our expectation is that supply for electromechanical components will improve in the second half of the year.\nAs Joe outlined, we're implementing a series of changes across our organization that are designed to meaningfully simplify the operating model and manufacturing footprint drive strategic clarity, improve operational efficiencies and accelerate future growth.\nIn addition to consolidating our operations into 4 vertically integrated global business units, we're also evaluating additional strategic actions, including potential product line and country exits to better position the company for more profitable growth over the mid to long term These exits are expected to reduce sales by more than $100 million as compared to full year '22.\nLastly, as it relates to the top line 2022 results, included approximately $140 million of sales that are not expected to repeat in 2023 as well as the benefit of approximately $50 million due to lower customer rebate costs, this includes lower COVID vaccine revenue of approximately $100 million and 2 contractual payments, which benefited Renal Care sales by approximately $40 million in the second half of 2022.\nMoving on to dynamics impacting the rest of the P&L. First, I want to point out a couple of factors that are impacting our 2023 performance as compared to 2022, such as higher annual incentive compensation payments for employees, increased interest expense and a higher tax rate assumption.\nIn addition, while we see some improvement in the external macro environment, with select indices coming down from the peaks seen last year, our cost base is still elevated relative to historic norms. As such, cost of goods sold is expected to be a headwind compared to 2022. This is due to the rollout in the first half of 2023 of manufacturing-related costs capitalized into inventory in the second half of 2022 as well as a challenging comparison to the first half of 2022 prior to the start of significant increases in inflation.\nWe expect the impact from these inflationary pressures to begin to ease in the second half of the year. Also, as mentioned earlier, in response to the significant macro challenges the company has experienced over the last 2 years, we will be implementing a cost reduction program in parallel with our operating model redesign that is expected to be finalized later this quarter. This initiative and additional actions the company has undertaken to enhance performance are expected to deliver more than $300 million in total savings during 2023.\nThese savings are expected to increase over the course of the year, with the majority of the savings being realized in the second half of the year. The lower cost of goods, coupled with the increased savings, are expected to drive meaningful margin expansion and earnings growth in the second half of the year as compared to the first half. We also expect the impact from foreign exchange to lessen in the second half of the year.\nFinally, as Joe mentioned, with respect to our outlook for 2023, we biased our guidance towards capturing additional potential downside risks. We recognize that our performance last year disappointed investors and us alike. While we are confident the actions we are undertaking will set us on force for improved performance longer term, we have recognized that 2023 will be a transition year on our path to achieving this objective.\nIncorporating all of these factors, I'll now walk through our guidance and expectations. For full year 2023, we expect global sales growth of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and flat to 1% growth on a constant currency basis. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be between 15% and 16%. Interest expense is expected to total approximately $540 million, which reflects pass and potential future rate increases and adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% and a diluted average share count of 508 million shares.\nBased on these dynamics, we expect 2023 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.75 to $2.95 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2023, we expect global sales to decline by approximately 3% on a reported basis and approximately 1% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.46 to $0.50 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open the call up for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rerecorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVP of IR, Baxter International Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter 2022 financial results and full year financial outlook for 2022. With that let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our 2022 to 2025 long-range plan, the acquisition of Hillrom, new product development, the potential impact of proposed pricing actions, business development, portfolio optimization and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website. On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth, which adjusts for the impact of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Hillrom. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJose E. Almeida\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's call. I will start with a look at our third quarter performance, including some perspective on the macro environmental factors impacting our near-term trajectory. Jay will provide a deeper dive on our financials and outlook, after which we will open up the lines for your questions.\nQ3 2022 represents the third full quarter since the close of our Hillrom acquisition. Total company sales of $3.8 billion grew 17% on a reported basis and 23% at a constant currency rates. Legacy Hillrom contributed $735 million to sales in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hillrom and foreign exchange, third quarter sales rose slightly on an operational basis.\nOn the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 were at the higher end of the guidance range we had provided previously. Both top line and bottom line performance in the quarter reflect the continued impact of macroeconomic headwinds, including significant inflationary pressures as well as ongoing global supply chain constraints, consistent with what many others are encountering globally.\nWith further regard to the macroeconomic environment, I want to note the impairment charge in our third quarter financials related to the Hillrom acquisition. Jay will provide additional details. But in short, this charge relates to many of the shifting market dynamics, including rising interest rates and lower valuation multiples that they have reduced equity values broadly along with the increased supply chain-related costs that we've previously discussed.\nWith that said, and with 10 months of progress in perspective, I want to underline our continuing confidence in the potential of the Hillrom acquisition. This is already playing out as an opportunity to expand the reach of both legacy portfolios geographically and across the continuum of care. It is also accelerating our connected care journey, expanding our digital footprint and helping to unlock the next wave of innovation across our R&D pipeline.\nIntegration of our legacy organization is advancing swiftly, and as previously shared, we are achieving even greater value capture through cost synergies than initially anticipated. Additionally, overall demand across the Baxter and legacy Hillrom portfolios remains solid, but we continue to experience meaningful back orders and backlogs due to reduced access to a variety of raw materials and electromechanical components. As I have shared previously, this has resulted not only in higher cost spot purchases but also expedited freight costs as we work steadfastly to get our life-sustaining products to the patients and clinicians who depend on us.\nWhile we see signals that some of these macro factors may begin to ease next year, our current expectation is that select supply constraints will persist into 2023, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, where we continue to see high levels of volatility in supply.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced several decommits from various suppliers, meaningfully impacting our overall demand planning process. We have also seen supply constraints from other raw materials, which has further impacted performance. In total, we estimate that the semiconductor and raw material constraints we've experienced negatively impacted Baxter top line performance in the quarter by more than $100 million or approximately 400 basis points. And on a year-to-date basis, we estimate this figure to be approaching $300 million. We continue to take decisive action to help mitigate these constraints and position the company for improved future performance.\nSome of the actions we have already undertaken include extending the horizon of our demand forecast out to 24 months for supply-constrained categories to allow our suppliers to allocate capacity and inventory to Baxter over a long horizon; validating alternate supply options to provide flexibility in sourcing; establishing direct buy relationships with critical secondary component suppliers; enhancing our manufacturing processes to further optimize material usage and reduce waste; and meeting with the management teams of our key suppliers and select government officials to reinforce the criticality of Baxter's products.\nWe are confident that these actions will further enhance our ability to help mitigate supply chain impacts on Baxter's near and midterm performance. At the same time, we remain focused on improving the operational efficiency across the organization. We've already implemented several initiatives that I expect to drive improved future performance, including ensuring that we have the optimal organization structure and business processes in place. In addition, we are pursuing some near-term actions to help offset the increased expenses we're experiencing.\nThese actions, including recent restructuring initiatives, broad hiring freeze, reduced discretionary spending and accelerating our Hillrom integration efforts. Additionally, we do expect to realize savings this year through lower annual employee incentive bonuses, which are directly tied to business performance.\nAlso, as mentioned last quarter, we have already passed on a portion of the incremental costs we've absorbed to our customers and are collaborating with them to finalize agreements, which include revised pricing terms to address continued cost pressures. We deeply value these relationships and appreciate the challenges that our customers themselves are facing. Upon successful execution and implementation of these agreements, we anticipate the related reviews will be reflected in our results next year. We believe that these actions will help underscore our unwavering commitment to our patients and customers. Collectively, these initiatives are fueled by the sustained emphasis on operational efficiency and cost base optimization that has powered our transformation to date. And as I will continue to stress, we will never pursue any actions that compromise our fundamental mission to save and sustain lives.\nWe are also actively advancing our strategic review of the portfolio to ensure the optimal structure to execute on our vision of transforming health care, to improve patient outcomes, enhance workflow efficiency and enable cost-effective care. We anticipate that we will be in a position to provide more details on these ongoing activities early next year. I want to reiterate that our strategic core and prospects remain firm, as is our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and the many other stakeholders we serve.\nBaxter's strength is founded on our diverse, durable portfolio of essential health care products, which will continue to be enhanced by our focus on driving innovation in connected care and core therapies.\nBaxter's industry leadership and increased scale, combined with our rapidly advancing digital capabilities, create a spectrum of prospects to help advance our impact in line with our life-saving mission and, in turn, to share our success with our shareholders and other stakeholder communities.\nFinally, I want to recognize and thank our employees for their remarkable effort always and especially as we navigate the current macro environment. Our global team consistently embraces our life-saving mission above all, rising to meet each new challenge with dedication, passion and a keen focus on serving the many stakeholders who depend on us.\nNow Jay will provide more details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nJames K. Saccaro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our results for the quarter came in largely as expected, with some impact to sales due to select supply chain-related constraints. As discussed earlier, our teams have been and continue to identify opportunities to help mitigate the unprecedented macroeconomic headwinds we continue to face, and we remain committed to delivering on our long-term objectives.\nTurning to our financial performance. Third quarter 2022 global sales of $3.8 billion advanced 17% on a reported basis, 23% on a constant currency basis and rose slightly on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings decreased 20% to $0.82 per share falling within our guidance range of $0.79 to $0.83 per share. Earnings in the quarter reflect the increased cost of raw materials, freight and labor as well as the impact of rising interest rates, foreign exchange headwinds and a higher tax rate.\nBefore I review our financial performance for the quarter, I wanted to spend a moment discussing the noncash impairment charge that we recorded related to the Hillrom acquisition. When we purchased Hillrom, we valued the business based on anticipated cash flows, Baxter's prevailing cost of capital and market EBITDA multiples at the time of the transaction. As Joe mentioned, the primary reason for the write-down was due to changes in external factors that have occurred since the acquisition date, specifically, the significant increase in interest rates we have seen and the reduction in market-based EBITDA multiples.\nAs we evaluated these environmental factors and coupled them with the supply chain impacts we've incurred, which we carry forward in our projections, we deemed it appropriate to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets associated with Hillrom.\nI want to reinforce Joe's earlier comments that we continue to see tremendous potential for our combined portfolios. We have accelerated our cost synergy targets, which continue to track ahead of our expectations, and our commercial leaders are driving actions to unlock the growth of the combined company.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Note that constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses and Baxter's 3 legacy geographic regions. Starting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas were flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 3% on a constant currency basis, and sales in our APAC region decreased 2% on a constant currency basis. Quarterly sales in that region reflected a slowdown in growth in China due to the country's Zero COVID policy, which we estimate impacted sales by approximately $10 million in the quarter, as well as the anticipated impact from various value-based procurement initiatives being implemented in the region.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal Care were $942 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by solid growth in our PD business, where we observed an increase in PD patients globally. PD growth was augmented by 2 discrete items totaling approximately $20 million.\nPerformance in the quarter was partially offset by lower in-center HD sales partially due to HD monitor supply challenges due to component availability. Sales in Medication Delivery of $725 million were at similar level to prior year sales on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we observed strong demand for products in our IV Therapy portfolio. This growth was more than offset by lower infusion system sales as component availability remain challenged, coupled with a large hospital system order in Q3 in 2021, which created this difficult comparator to the prior year.\nPharmaceutical sales of $525 million declined 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter reflects declines in our global generic injectables portfolio due to continued increased competitive activity, which were partially offset by increased sales of inhaled anesthesia globally.\nMoving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $231 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our broad multichamber product offering, partially offset by supply-related challenges for our vitamins.\nSales in Advanced Surgery were $247 million, advancing 6% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflects recovery of elective procedures relative to pre-COVID levels. Surgical volume recovery was strong in Europe, while procedures in the U.S. and APAC region came in slightly below our expectations. Within the U.S., we observed a slow start to July with an uptick in August and September.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $158 million, declining 9% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a tough comparison to the prior year, where we had experienced elevated demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases. BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $172 million, declining 10% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a step-down in sales of COVID vaccines compared to the same period last year. COVID vaccine sales for the quarter totaled approximately $30 million. Hillrom contributed $735 million in sales for the quarter, which included $380 million of sales in Patient Support Systems, $279 million of sales in Front Line Care and $76 million of sales in global Surgical Solutions.\nHillrom declined mid-single digits on a constant currency basis as compared to Q3 2021, when the company was a stand-alone entity. Performance in the quarter reflects a difficult comparison to the prior year period as well as the impact of the semiconductor supply constraints we've discussed. We continue to experience record levels of backlog for the legacy Hillrom business. Our order book remains strong. And to date, we have not seen any significant cancellations from customers. As mentioned last quarter, we remain somewhat cautious on capital spending as hospitals continue to assess their budgets in light of the current market environment.\nMoving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.9% decreased by 110 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased cost of goods sold primarily driven by the factors we've discussed around inflation, freight and supply chain constraints. Adjusted SG&A of $821 million represented 21.8 as a percentage of sales, an increase of 200 basis points versus prior year driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as higher freight expenses. As mentioned earlier, we continue to tightly manage SG&A base.\nAdjusted R&D spend in the quarter of $148 million represented 3.9 as a percentage of sales, a decrease of 10 basis points versus prior year. Both adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D reflect a little benefit from lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans, which is directly tied to Baxter's performance. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 17.2%, a decrease of 300 basis points versus the prior year.\nAdjusted net interest expense totaled $104 million in the quarter, an increase of $72 million versus the prior year driven by higher outstanding debt balances related to the acquisition of Hillrom. Adjusted other nonoperating income totaled $2 million in the quarter compared to a $12 million loss in the prior year period driven by -- primarily by amortization of pension benefits.\nThe adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23.8% as it compared to 14.8% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the mix of earnings in the quarter, which has changed following the Hillrom acquisition. In addition, during the third quarter of 2021, the company recognized a benefit in its effective tax rate from a discrete item due to a reserve release resulting from a favorable tax ruling. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.82 per diluted share declined 20% versus the prior period.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, including some key assumptions underpinning our updated guidance. We have adjusted our full year earnings per share outlook primarily to account for a strengthening U.S. dollar and the resulting foreign exchange headwind, increased interest expense assumptions given rising interest rates and a higher expected full year tax rate due to earnings mix.\nAs discussed, we anticipate electromechanical component availability will remain challenged in the fourth quarter and into 2023, which will continue to hamper sales growth for select businesses, including Medication Delivery, Front Line Care and Patient Support Systems.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect global sales growth of mid- to high single digits on a reported basis, mid-teens on a constant currency basis and approximately flat on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.92 to $0.99 per diluted share. For full year 2022, we now expect global sales growth of 17% to 18% on a reported basis, approximately 23% on a constant currency basis and low single digits operationally.\nMoving down to P&L. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be between 17% and 17.5%, reflecting the impact of all of the various dynamics we've discussed today. For the year, we now expect interest expense to total approximately $400 million, given rate increases and adjusted tax rate of approximately 20% and a diluted share count of 508 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2022 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.53 to $3.60 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

Joe?\n\nJose E. Almeida\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's call. I will begin with an overview of the macroeconomic factors they have and will continue to impact our performance in 2022. I will then provide some commentary on the second quarter. Jay will take a closer look at our financials and outlook, after which we will open up the lines for your questions.\nI want to start by thanking many of you for joining us at our 2022 investor conference, whether in person or virtually. Our goal was to share our strategy to drive leading-edge health care innovation create compelling value for patients, clinicians, employees and investors. It was also a great opportunity to showcase how the acquisition of Hillrom is helping power the next phase of our transformation journey by fueling connected care innovation, expanding the global reach of our combined portfolio and growing our presence across the continuum of care.\nAnd our innovation hall offered a firsthand look at how this momentum is already coming to life in tangible ways in hospitals, homes and physicians' offices worldwide.\nWith respect to our current environment, overall demand remains strong across our combined portfolio. At the same time, we're experiencing significant back quarters and backlogs for certain products due to ongoing supply chain challenges like those impacting industries globally. This is affecting access to a variety of raw materials and components, including electromechanical components used in many of our products. Securing these necessary components has resulted in an incremental spot purchases with costs that are meaningfully above and beyond what we had anticipated earlier this year.\nIn addition, the delays in receiving many of these materials and/or components have forced unplanned temporary shutdowns in our manufacturing facilities, which negatively impact our absorption rates.\nTaken together, the negative impact of these increased spot purchases and temporary shutdowns will primarily be realized in Baxter's results during the second half of the year. In addition, ongoing inflationary pressures, coupled with increased freight expenses, primarily driven by the rapid rise in diesel and jet fuel prices has created incremental pressures on the cost of doing business for the company. As the quarter progressed, we saw both diesel and jet fuel prices diverging from crude oil increasing at a much faster pace. Historically, changes to both diesel and jet fuel prices have trended in line with the degree of change seen in crude oil prices.\nAnd with our mission to save and sustain lives, we will never compromise on doing what is right to address the urgent needs of the patients and clinicians that depend on us. This means utilizing more expedited shipping channels than anticipated as we work relentlessly to ensure products get to where they are most needed. It also means carrying higher levels of inventory than normal as many of our raw materials and finished goods are held up in transit given ongoing global supply chain challenges.\nAt our investor conference, you heard some of the significant actions we have been implementing in response to unprecedented challenges. Our actions reflect the unrelenting commitment to operational excellence, there has been a signature of our multiyear transformation. This tenacity is helping us navigate and mitigate near-term pressures to the degree possible as we stay focused on driving long-term value and growth for our shareholders and other key stakeholders.\nAs always, we remain committed to ensuring we have the optimal cost structure. And to that end, we are actively identifying opportunities to further optimize our expense base to enhance performance, including pulling forward certain Hillrom cost synergies.\nGiven the significant increase in costs that we have absorbed and continue to incur in the production and delivery of our portfolio of life-saving products, we are preparing to pass through a portion of this incremental cost to our customers in the second half of 2022 and beyond.\nShifting now to our second quarter financial performance, which is the second full quarter since the close of our Hillrom acquisition. Sales for the quarter grew 21% and on a reported basis and 26% at constant currency rates. Legacy Hillrom sales contributed $715 million to our total $3.7 billion in sales for the second quarter.\nExcluding the impact of Hillrom and foreign exchange, second quarter sales increased 3% on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 were up 9% year-over-year. Growth on both the top and bottom line continues to be constrained by the macroeconomic factors shared previously.\nThis said, performance across our businesses in the second quarter reflects our overall positive trajectory amid the broader state of the market demand. This includes solid growth at constant currency rate in Renal Care, Medication Delivery, Pharmaceuticals, Clinical Nutrition and Advanced Surgery.\nWith specific regard to Pharmaceuticals, I want to flag that we are continuing to experience price erosion in the U.S. due to generic competition as well as some pressure from supply constraints and a shift in demand for inhaled anesthesia. As we noted at our investor conference, we are continuing to emphasize differentiated generic formulations and packaging as well as international opportunities to drive growth for this business moving forward.\nI'm also pleased to share that Alok Sonig joined us a few weeks ago as our new President of Pharmaceuticals. Alok brings to Baxter more than 25 years of experience in the life sciences industry, most recently serving as the U.S. CEO and Global Head of Research and Development and Biosimilars at Lupin. We are excited to welcome Alok to the team and look forward to realizing the benefits of the experience he brings to this business.\nBoth Acute Therapies and BioPharma Solutions declined mid-single digits year-over-year at constant currency rates, reflecting a challenging comparison to last year due to pandemic-related sales for both of these product categories. As compared to Q2 2021, when our newly acquired Hillrom business was a stand-alone company, its sales rose low single digits at constant currency rates. This demand reflects mid-single-digit growth in Front Line Care, offset by softness in Patient Support Systems and Global Surgical Solutions. Sales in all 3 of the legacy Hillrom businesses have been impacted by significantly higher than normal backlogs, reflecting challenges in accessing components as well as delays in certain product installs because of hospital staffing concerns and challenges.\nOn a positive note, our integration process continues to proceed rapidly with key milestones on track or ahead of expectations. And as you saw at our investor conference, we are moving swiftly on our opportunities to expand access across our combined portfolio and embrace our heightened potential in connected care.\nNow looking ahead, given the factors I outlined earlier in my remarks, external conditions, expectations and the market's ability to project trends continue to evolve rapidly, both upstream and downstream. Even in the months between our investor conference and today, and this is impacting our business. As such, we're adjusting our guidance for the balance of 2022, as indicated in our press release. Jay will share additional commentary in his remarks.\nAt the same time, we continue to foresee long-term stabilization of conditions. Given this anticipated stabilization and our updated 2022 guidance, I want to reiterate my confidence in our long-term outlook and prospects as provided in May. Baxter has proven its resilience time and again over the course of its 90-plus years, our durable portfolio focus on essential care and vast global footprint remain the strategic core of our underlying strength and stability.\nThe acquisition of Hillrom has expanded the scope of our essential portfolio and has also created additional opportunities in connected care they are vital to accelerating our future impact as a health care leader and innovator.\nFinally, I hope that you have had a chance to review Baxter's annual corporate responsibility report issued in June. It highlights our progress towards our 2030 corporate responsibility goals, which reflect our commitment to empower patients, protect our planet and champion our people and communities. If you have not yet had the opportunity, you can find the report posted on our website, baxter.com.\nNow I will pass it to Jay to share more on our performance and outlook.\n\nJames K. Saccaro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're continuing to navigate a dynamic and ever-changing macro environment. This near-term volatility has created certain challenges for our business and led us to lowering our full year outlook. But we're committed to working through these headwinds and delivering on our long-term commitments off this new base.\nMost importantly, demand for our Baxter products remain strong, and our integrated supply chain and commercial teams are working tirelessly to get products in the hands of our customers and patients to fulfill our mission.\nTurning to our financial performance. Second quarter 2022 global sales of $3.7 billion advanced 21% on a reported basis, 26% constant currency and 3% operationally. As the U.S. dollar strengthened over the quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted reported sales by approximately 500 basis points. And as Joe mentioned, sales within the quarter were constrained due to lack of both raw materials and component availability particularly as it relates to electromechanical components.\nSecond quarter sales were also impacted by a lack of hospital access, which is needed to install select products, particularly in our Patient Support Systems product category. We estimate these constraints negatively impacted sales by over 300 basis points in the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, operational sales grew 3%, reflecting a gradual recovery in hospital admission rates and elective surgeries, strength in our Medication Delivery and Nutrition businesses and solid growth in PD. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 9% to $0.87 per share, falling within our guidance range of $0.86 to $0.89 per share.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Note that constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses and Baxter's 3 legacy geographic regions.\nStarting with sales by operational segment. Sales in the Americas increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 6% on a constant currency basis, and sales in our APAC region increased 1% on a constant currency basis. Sales in our APAC region were negatively impacted in the quarter by the resurgence of COVID cases in the region, particularly in China, which we estimate was an impact of approximately $15 million.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal Care were $931 million, increasing 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by solid growth in our PD business, where we observed both a sequential and year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes. This growth was partially offset by lower in-center HD sales, partially due to HD monitor supply challenges due to component availability.\nSales in Medication Delivery of $710 million, increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this business reflects strong global demand for our products in our IV therapy portfolio. This was partially offset by lower sales in APAC driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China and the resulting impact on utilization. This product category was also impacted by lower sales of large-volume pumps in the quarter due to constrained demand from the lack of component availability.\nThe Pharmaceutical sales of $528 million grew 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by increased sales internationally for inhaled anesthetics offsetting increased competition within our U.S. generic injectables portfolio as well as supply constraints for select molecules.\nMoving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $230 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our broad multi-chamber product offering, vitamins and automated compounding.\nSales in Advanced Surgery were $263 million, advancing 8% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflects continued gradual recovery of elective procedures in the U.S. and Europe as well as strong demand for RECOTHROM given competitive constraints. Recovery in our APAC region remains subdued with several countries experiencing somewhat depressed levels of surgical volumes.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $173 million, declining 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year period where we experienced elevated demand for CRRT given the rising COVID cases.\nBioPharma Solutions in the quarter were $163 million, declining 5% on a constant currency basis and reflecting an expected step down in sales of COVID vaccines compared to the same period last year. COVID vaccine sales for the quarter totaled approximately $35 million.\nHillrom contributed $715 million in sales in the quarter, which included $364 million of sales in Patient Support Systems, $282 million of sales in Front Line Care and $69 million of sales in Global Surgical Solutions. Hillrom grew 2% on a constant currency basis as compared to Q2 2021 when the company was a stand-alone entity.\nDespite solid growth in the quarter, sales came in below our expectations, largely due to the supply constraints for electromechanical parts, primarily impacting Frontline Care as well as select delays in product installations in patient support systems and global surgical solutions due to lack of hospital access.\nAs a result, we're experiencing unprecedented levels of product backlog throughout these businesses. Demand remains strong, though, and we'll continue to monitor the situation and work this backlog as rapidly as possible. And while to date, we haven't yet seen an impact on the flow of capital orders, we are taking a more conservative approach for the second half given delays related to hospital staffing challenges as well as more cautious commentary from customers regarding hospital CapEx.\nMoving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.5% decreased by 10 basis points over the prior year, reflecting the impact of increased expenses primarily driven by inflation and freight. Adjusted SG&A of $839 million represented 22.4 as a percent of sales, an increase of 150 basis points versus prior year, driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as higher freight expenses partially offset by lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans.\nAdjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $148 million represents 4% as a percent of sales, a decrease of 50 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points versus the prior year primarily driven by incremental freight expenses in the quarter, resulting from higher fuel prices and inflation, partly offset by actions we are taking to improve productivity and reduce spend.\nAdjusted net interest expense totaled $89 million in the quarter, an increase of $55 million versus the prior year, driven by higher outstanding debt balances related to the acquisition of Hillrom. Given the current interest rate environment, we now expect net interest expense to be slightly higher than we had previously forecasted.\nAdjusted other nonoperating income totaled $33 million in the quarter, an increase of $31 million compared to the prior year period, driven by foreign exchange and equity investment gains as well as amortization of pension benefits. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% as compared to 17.8% in the prior period. The year-over-year increase was driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as lower stock-based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.87 per diluted share advanced 9% versus the prior year period.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022, including some key assumptions underpinning our revised guidance. As discussed, throughout the second quarter, Baxter experienced increased inflationary pressure related to fuel, commodity and labor prices. Our prior outlook did not assume the divergence we are experiencing between diesel and crude oil, but did assume an easing commodity pricing in line with external indices forecast.\nOur current outlook now assumes pricing for these key raw materials remains at current levels for the remainder of the year. We anticipate component availability remains challenging through the second half of 2022, which will continue to impact our overall production volumes and absorption rates.\nWe anticipate our order backlog will stay at elevated levels, resulting in a phasing impact to top line sales, primarily for infusion pumps in the Frontline Care business. Our teams are working tirelessly to secure key electronic components to lower our backlog to more normalized levels. In addition, we project a potential slowdown in hospital capital spending in the second half of the year, which will impact our PSS and GSS businesses.\nFor the third quarter of 2022, we expect global sales growth of high teens on a reported basis, mid-20s on a constant currency basis and low single digits operationally, and we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.79 to $0.83 per diluted share.\nFor full year 2022, we now expect global sales growth of high teens on a reported basis, mid-20s constant currency and 2% to 3% operationally. As mentioned earlier, operational growth for Baxter excludes the impact of foreign exchange and Hillrom. The reduction in our sales guidance reflects increased foreign exchange headwinds, a lower sales outlook for our Pharmaceuticals business and the legacy Hillrom business.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be between 17% to 17.5%, reflecting the impact of all the various macroeconomic dynamics I've discussed today. For the year, we now expect interest expense to total approximately $400 million, given rate increases and adjusted tax rate of approximately 19% and a diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares.\nIn addition, we expect the incremental FX top line headwinds will negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.05 in the second half of the year. Based on these factors, we now expect 2022 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.60 to $3.70 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trackman, Vice President, Investor Relations at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.\n\nClare Trachtman\n\nVP of IR, Baxter International Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer; Giuseppe Accogli, Baxter's Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Borzi, Baxter's Chief Supply Chain Officer.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's first quarter 2022 financial results and full year financial outlook for 2022. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022, the recent acquisition of Hillrom, new product development, business development and regulatory matters including ones related to the 510(k) review of the NOVUM IQ infusion platform contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nIn addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website. On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth, which adjusts for the impact of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Hillrom.\nBefore I turn the call over to Joe, I wanted to let everyone know that the registration link for our 2022 Investor Conference, which is being held on Wednesday, May 25 in Glenview, Illinois is now available on our website. Please visit the Investor Relations section of Baxter's website to register for the event.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Joe?\n\nJose E. Almeida\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I will get started with an overview of first quarter performance, trajectory and a quick preview of what you can expect in our upcoming investor conference in May. Jay will take a closer look at our financials as well as our outlook for the current quarter and balance of the year. Then we will close with your questions. As you know, first quarter 2022 represents our first full quarter since the close of Hillrom acquisition. I'm pleased to report solid results for the combined company on both the top and bottom line, reflecting the ongoing momentum of legacy Baxter businesses as well as the early promise and potential of our Hillrom integration.\nFirst quarter sales grew 26% on a reported basis and 29% at constant currency. With legacy Hillrom sales contributing $755 million to our total $3.7 billion in reported sales for the quarter. Excluding the impact of Hillrom and foreign exchange, first quarter sales rose 3% on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 increased 22%, exceeding our guidance of $0.79 to $0.82.\nPerformance in the quarter reflects the contribution from Hillrom. First quarter performance continued to reflect the ongoing erratic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled demand in some of our businesses, while dragging on performance in others. As ever, the diversity and durability of our portfolio in combination with our global footprint act as buffers that help us weather the extremes in these factors are only bolstered with at its scope and opportunity created through the addition of Hillrom.\nWe continue to see solid demand across both legacy Baxter and Hillrom businesses. We are still experiencing pockets of back orders and backlogs due to the significant supply chain challenges that have made it increasingly difficult at times to access a range of raw materials and components, particularly electromechanical components. Similarly, we continue to experience increased inflationary pressures and rising freight costs, which have only intensified in the wake of the war between Ukraine and Russia.\nOur focus on efficiency and disciplined expense management has gone a long way to partially offset these challenges. And I'm proud of our integrated supply chain team for its strategic moves in procurement and logistics that are helping us meet the needs of patients and clinicians while helping to support sustained value and growth of our shareholders.\nTaking a deeper dive by business, performance was led by BioPharma Solutions, which advanced 21% at constant rates. This was driven by a favorable year-over-year comparison related to revenues from the manufacture of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Our Medication Delivery business increased 10% at constant rates, driven by growth in IV therapies. As you saw in this morning's release, we shared a status update on our NOVUM IQ large-volume infusion pump with Dose IQ Safety Software, which has been under review by FDA. We received the letter from the agency last Friday with a request for additional information. As a result of the 510(k) review window has been placed on hold so that our team can address accordingly.\nThe team currently plans to respond to FDA within the calendar year. We remain on track to submit responses on the NOVUM IQ syringe pump filing to FDA in the second quarter of 2022. I want to emphasize why we can speak for FDA or the eventual outcome of their review process, we are confident in our leading-edge NOVUM IQ technology. We are committed to responding to FDA's request and to bringing the benefits of NOVUM IQ to patients and clinicians in the U.S. and beyond.\nAdvanced Surgery performance was up 8% at constant rates, driven by year-over-year improvement in the rate of surgical procedures following depressed rates due to the pandemic. Renal Care rose 1% at constant currency rates, with a mid-single-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by a low single-digit decline internationally. Growth in the quarter was driven by global demand for our home peritoneal dialysis products, partially offset by lower sales of dialyzers internationally. As we have discussed previously, PD patient demand has been constrained due to the pandemic-driven factors, including higher mortality rates for kidney disease patients and the lower rate of new patients diagnosis.\nWe remain confident of renewed uptake in PD therapy over the upcoming years as well as in the health and lifestyle factors that make home-based therapy a compelling choice for patients and clinicians. Clinical Nutrition also grew 1% at constant currency, reflecting improving demand for selected parenteral nutrition products, growth in the quarter was dampened by ongoing supply constraints for vitamins globally. Pharmaceuticals declined 2% at constant currency, reflecting continued increased competitive activity for certain U.S. generics as well as the impact of supply constraints that impacted production volumes during the quarter. We continue to focus on launching new molecules in complex formulations as well as embracing our international growth opportunities to help accelerate performance in the business moving forward.\nFinally, among our legacy business, Acute Therapies declined 7% at constant currency, reflecting a challenging year-over-year comparison due to the last year's surging demand for continuous renal replacement therapy or CRRT products amid the pandemic. Underlying performance in this product category continues to build momentum with the pandemic only further highlighting the vital role of CRRT products in the ICU. As I stated earlier, our newly acquired Hillrom businesses contributed $755 million to sales in the quarter. Our global integration is proceeding on course, and we are starting to seize our key opportunities to expand global access to our growing portfolio as well as uniting our capabilities to expand our presence in connected care.\nLooking ahead, I want to note that our regional outlook for 2022 did not anticipate the tragic outbreak of a war in Ukraine. The conflict is partially disrupting our ability to serve patients locally, although we are working hard to serve Ukrainian patients and refugees directly and through our humanitarian aide partners. We are also, like many other companies, assessing our profile in Russia, although as a health care company, there are certain life-sustaining products that we are continuing to make available to patients in line with current sanctions. The conflict has also caused a ripple effect across the supply chain network globally resulting in rising oil prices, which we expect to negatively impact freight material and utility costs this year. In addition, given the current time line anticipated for NOVUM IQ, we have made the decision to remove any related sales contribution in 2022. These factors, coupled with ongoing increased inflationary pressures have resulted in adjustments to our guidance for the balance of the year as Jay will review in a moment.\nOur teams are working diligently to find potential offsets to these increased expenses. And as we mentioned last quarter, we have identified opportunities where it may be possible to pass through some of these costs in select geographies. While the global macroeconomic landscape continues to present unique challenges, we are, nonetheless, excited about our overall prospects, momentum and capacity to make a difference for our many stakeholders. We look forward to giving your deeper insights on our trajectory next month at our 2022 investor conference. We will share a broader look at our growth strategy fueled by advances in connected care as well as our commitment to ongoing therapeutic innovation. We will also provide more detail on how expanded global access and uncompromising portfolio management should contribute to profitable growth.\nIn addition, we will highlight the rapid evolution of our integrated supply chain function as we work to address today's operational challenges head on and continue to evolve for the future. You'll see Baxter's health care innovations firsthand at our interactive innovation hall, and as always, we'll be including plenty of time for your questions and informal networking with our senior leadership team. I look forward to seeing many of you in person in the event will also be webcast for online viewing.\nNow I will pass it to Jay who will take a closer look at our first quarter results and '22 outlook.\n\nJames K. Saccaro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter performance especially in light of the geopolitical unrest and macroeconomic headwinds causing incremental supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and elevated freight costs. We're working through these headwinds with consistent focus on operational efficiency and disciplined expense management.\nTurning to our financial performance. First quarter 2022 global sales of $3.7 billion advanced 26% on a reported basis, 29% on a constant currency basis and 3% on an operational basis. Sales came in at the high end of our guidance range this quarter, with growth reflecting recovery in hospital admission rates and elective surgeries, the benefit from revenues associated with the manufacturing of COVID vaccines and strength in our Medication Delivery business, which benefited from growth of IV therapies as well as lower customer rebate costs during the quarter.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 22% to $0.93 per share. This compared favorably to our guidance of $0.79 to $0.82 per share, driven by better-than-expected gross margins, which was driven by product mix as well as disciplined execution on cost synergies associated with the acquisition.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Note that constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses and Baxter's 3 legacy geographic regions. Starting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 2% on a constant currency basis and sales in our APAC region were flat on a constant currency basis. Sales in our APAC region were negatively impacted in the quarter by the resurgence of COVID cases in the region particularly in China, we are continuing to monitor the situation in China and the potential impact on our operations from further lockdowns.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Global sales for Renal Care were $894 million, increasing 1% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth in our PD business as global patient volumes increased on a year-over-year basis despite persistent pressures from increased mortality rates in ESRD patients, delays in new patient diagnoses and market-wide staffing shortages. This growth was offset by lower dialyzer sales in our international in-center HD business.\nSales in Medication Delivery of $706 million increased 10% on a constant currency basis. Strong U.S. growth in this business reflects continued recovery in the pace of hospital admissions compared to pre-COVID levels as well as increased demand for IV administration sets and solutions. Sales also benefited from lower customer rebates in the quarter. For the quarter, we estimate that U.S. hospital admissions were down low single digits compared to pre-COVID levels.\nPharmaceutical sales of $521 million declined 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was negatively impacted by increased competition for select molecules in our U.S. generic injectables portfolio, lower sales of inhaled anesthetic and pandemic-related supply constraints driven in part by labor shortages at certain of our manufacturing facilities.\nMoving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $227 million, increasing 1% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of new product launches within our broad multi-chamber product offering.\nSales in Advanced Surgery were $228 million, advancing 8% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter reflected elective procedure recovery in the U.S. and Europe. We've seen recovery stall in our Asia Pacific region with Australia, Korea, Japan and Taiwan experiencing somewhat depressed levels of surgical volumes. In the U.S., we saw surgical procedures come under pressure in January as a result of the Omicron variant, but the impact on volumes was short-lived with procedural volumes improving into February and March. Our current assumption is for U.S. surgical procedures in the U.S. to remain above pre-COVID levels for the remainder of the year.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 7% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2021 when we experienced heightened demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases.\nBioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $156 million, representing growth of 21% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, which totaled approximately $45 million in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, vaccine sales are forecasted to be approximately $60 million lower than prior year sales.\nHillrom contributed $755 million in sales for the quarter, which included $383 million of sales in Patient Support services, $294 million of sales in Front Line Care and $78 million of sales in Global Surgical Solutions. On a constant currency basis as compared to Q1 2021, when Hillrom was a stand-alone company, its sales were flat year-over-year, reflecting a challenging comparison as sales in the first quarter of 2021 benefited from COVID-related sales of approximately $40 million.\nMoving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 45% increased by 300 basis points over the prior year, reflecting the contribution of Hillrom within the quarter and lower rebate costs. Adjusted SG&A of $855 million, representing $23.1 million as a percentage of sales, an increase of 240 basis points versus prior year, driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as higher freight expenses. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $149 million represented 4% as a percentage of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points versus prior year. Increased levels of SG&A and R&D spend reflect the contribution from Hillrom. We're on track with our cost synergies target for the year, and we're able to pull forward certain initiatives resulting in a benefit to operating expenses in the first quarter.\nAdjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 18%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the various factors I just discussed. Adjusted net interest expense totaled $85 million in the quarter, an increase of $51 million versus the prior year, driven by higher outstanding debt balances related to the acquisition of Hillrom. Given the current interest rate environment, we now expect net interest expense to be higher than we had previously forecasted. Other nonoperating income totaled $16 million in the quarter, an increase of $21 million compared to the prior year period, driven by foreign exchange gains and amortization of pension benefits. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 20.8% as compared to 16% in the prior period.\nThe year-over-year increase was driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as the prior year tax rate reflected a discrete benefit. The tax rate in the quarter was unfavorable to our expectations due to the mix of earnings within the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.93 per diluted share advanced 22% versus the prior year period.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022, including certain key assumptions around phasing for the year. As Joe mentioned earlier, we have made the decision to remove any NOVUM IQ infusion system sales in 2022, which is reflected in our updated sales outlook. At this time, we are not able to offset the expected NOVUM sales with Spectrum as we are supply constrained on certain electromechanical parts for the Spectrum pump. In addition, the global macro disruptions emerging from new COVID outbreaks in China, the war between Russia and Ukraine and continued supply chain constraints across our network have created challenges to our ongoing operations. While we continue to evaluate opportunities to drive better efficiency in our integrated supply chain as well as pass through some of these costs to our customers, these factors have resulted in increased expenses, which are expected to negatively impact our results throughout the remainder of the year.\nThese incremental expenses, which are primarily related to higher oil prices and increased inflationary pressures are reflected in our updated financial outlook. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect global sales growth of approximately 26% on a reported basis, 29% to 30% on a constant currency basis and approximately 4% operationally. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.86 to $0.89 per diluted share. For full year 2022, we now expect global sales growth of 23% to 24% on a reported basis, 25% to 26% on a constant currency basis and approximately 3% on an operational basis. As mentioned earlier, operational growth for Baxter excludes the impact of foreign exchange and Hillrom.\nMoving down the P&L., we expect full year adjusted operating margin to be similar to the prior year period. For the full year, we now expect interest expense to total approximately $375 million and adjusted tax rate of 19% to 19.5% and a diluted average share count of 508 million to 510 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2022 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $4.12 to $4.20 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial Officer; and Giuseppe Accogli, Baxter's Chief Operating Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results along with our financial outlook for 2022.\nWith that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, including the anticipated impact of COVID and inflationary pressures on this outlook, the recent acquisition of Hillrom, including anticipated cost synergies from future net leverage targets, new product developments or launches, business development and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Hillrom financial results for these periods are reported as the new operating segment in addition to Baxter's existing 3 geographic segments.\nOn the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth, which for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 adjusts for the impact of foreign exchange, the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom and the February 2021 acquisition of the rights to Caelyx and Doxil for specified territories outside of the U.S. Later in the call, Jay will discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022. Operational sales growth for 2022 will exclude the impact of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Hillrom. Historical 2021 quarterly sales for Hillrom have been posted to the Investors section of our website.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJose E. Almeida\n\nChairman of the Board, President & CEO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThank you, Clare. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As always, I hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We start this morning with some perspective on our performance last year and future trajectory. Jay will take a closer look at the financials and share our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, then we'll take your questions.\nAs you all know, this is our first earnings call since acquiring Hillrom, the next inflection point in Baxter's multiyear transformation. The combination further extends our already diverse med tech portfolio and provides opportunities to broaden our reach, both geographically and across the care continuum.\nImportantly, it also unlocks exciting new possibilities for connected care innovation across our product lines with the potential to spark clinical insights, enhance patient outcomes and increase workflow efficiencies. In short, it holds the promise of greater value for all of our stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our employees and investors. The deal closed on December 13. So our Q4 and full year 2021 financials reflect 19 days of contribution from Hillrom.\nLooking at company-wide performance. Baxter delivered fourth quarter 2021 sales growth of 10% on a reported basis, 12% at constant currency and 4% at operational rates. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.04, up 30% year-over-year. Hillrom contributed $212 million in sales and $0.08 of adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. For full year 2021, sales growth was 10% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an operational basis.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $3.61 increased 17% year-over-year, which also reflects the contribution of Hillrom. Growth for both the quarter and year reflect the ongoing somewhat erratic impact of COVID-19, which negatively affected top line sales for certain businesses while fueling demand for others, particularly later in the fourth quarter as the Omicron variant surged.\nOur top line performance for the year continues to demonstrate the diversity and durability of our portfolio, which allowed us to deliver operational sales growth of 5% for the year. Demand across both our legacy Baxter and legacy Hillrom businesses is strong. During the fourth quarter and continuing through the start of this year, we have been experiencing a higher-than-normal rate of back orders due to certain supply chain limitations and staffing-related challenges in our plants resulting from high rates of absenteeism amid the rising cases of COVID. We are working expeditiously to address the situation and anticipate continued improvement in the coming weeks.\nAs we have discussed throughout the year, our cost structure has been negatively impacted by rising rates of inflation as well as an increasingly challenging supply chain network, which has at times resulted in expedited shipments and extraordinary steps to procure necessary components. While our teams have worked diligently to offset many of these pressures, our fourth quarter results reflect higher-than-expected freight costs given the critical and essential nature of our products.\nWe made decisions to expedite product to our customers to ensure we stay true to our mission, which means prioritizing the needs of patients and clinicians who depend on steady access to our life-saving products. We will never compromise on this commitment.\nWe are realistic about the supply chain challenges that continue to test the global industry as a whole. And we are laser-focused on addressing them successfully now and going forward. We are in the process of implementing new measures in procurement and logistics, including evaluating opportunities to pass through certain costs in selected geographies that will enhance performance and deliver value to our stakeholders, both in the near term and long run.\nWe are focused on making sound choices to promote our long-term success as a viable growing enterprise. We're building off our solid foundation and remain focused on executing against our multiyear transformation. This transformation has bolstered our operational efficiency and giving us the tools to navigate through these challenging times where the resilience and tenacity this team has demonstrated over the course of the last 2 years.\nBeyond this, the acquisition of Hillrom introduced crucial growth drivers across multiple fronts. The integration process is moving forward productively. We are already identifying opportunities for geographic expansion as well as synergies to drive meaningful cost reduction and margin expansion. And we are advancing connected care across our newly expanded capabilities.\nAs always, we continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure the businesses we operate are aligned with our long-term strategic objective to accelerate top line growth and expand margins. This commitment was clearly demonstrated with the Hillrom acquisition, which augmented and strengthened our underlying portfolio.\nAs part of this ongoing process, to the extent we identify areas that do not align with our long-term objectives, we will look to exit or divest these businesses while also continuing to identify new opportunities to enhance future performance. We recognize that innovation is at the core of any successful enterprise, and we are focused on introducing new products to address the evolving needs of our customers and patients.\nSome of these include the anticipated U.S. launch of our NOVUM IQ smart pump this year as well as our TrueVue connected digital solutions for our PrisMax 2 continuous renal replacement therapy technology, which is in early stage launch right now in the U.S. and Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nObviously, we assess our performance across multiple dimensions just as we must continually strengthen our performance as a thriving and resilient enterprise. Our mission also demands our continued leadership as a corporate citizen. 2021 marked the launch of our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment, comprising 10 key goals for the next decade and beyond, focused on 3 key action areas: empower our patients, protect our planet, and champion our people and communities.\nWe have also taken significant steps in the past year to advance our Activating Change Today or ACT initiative to advance racial justice within Baxter and across the communities and markets we serve. Our progress as both a business and as a corporate citizen is due entirely to the commitment of our employees worldwide. This outstanding team has achieved so much in several years from building our transformation to stepping up tirelessly in the face of COVID-19.\nNow it stands prepared our new chapter of momentum and growth. With this team's proven track record, I'm confident in our ability to deliver on the opportunities we have worked so hard to create. We will be sharing much more about our strategic trajectory at our investor conference later this year.\nNow I will turn it over to Jay to share a closer look at our performance and outlook.\n\nJames K. Saccaro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Baxter International Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results, particularly in light of ongoing pandemic and global supply chain disruptions that we experienced during the quarter.\nFourth quarter 2021 global sales of $3.5 billion advanced 10% on a reported basis, 12% on a constant currency basis and 4% operationally. Sales came in at the high end of our guidance range, which is in line with the commentary we shared in early January and underscores the essential nature and durability of our portfolio.\nSales growth this quarter reflects the benefits of revenues associated with the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, strength in Medication Delivery, Renal Care, OUS sales of Caelyx, Doxil, which totaled approximately $35 million in the quarter, and a contribution of $212 million from Hillrom. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 30% to $1.04 per share. Results in the quarter reflected a contribution of $0.08 per share from Hillrom, inclusive of incremental interest expenses related to the transaction as well as unplanned foreign exchange losses totaling $0.04 and higher-than-expected freight costs of $0.05. As Joe mentioned, we incurred significant expedited freight costs late in the quarter as cases of COVID-19 surged.\nNow I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Starting with sales by operating segment. Sales in the Americas increased 5% on both the constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 5% on a constant currency basis and 1% operationally. And sales in our APAC region advanced 6% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an operational basis. As Clare mentioned, Hillrom's financial results are reported as a new operating segment in addition to Baxter's existing 3 geographic segments.\nMoving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for our Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusting for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx, Doxil.\nGlobal sales for Renal Care were $1 billion, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in both our HD and PD businesses. PD benefited from year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes despite persistent pressures from increased mortality rates in ESRD patients, delays in new patient diagnoses and market-wide staffing shortages. Patient growth improved sequentially throughout the year, with Q4 representing the highest patient growth in 2021.\nRenal Care sales in the quarter also benefited from mid-single-digit growth in our HD business primarily driven by increased international sales of dialyzers. We expect that higher mortality rates and delays in new patient diagnoses resulting from the pandemic will continue to somewhat dampen the rate of new patient growth in 2022, although we do anticipate these rates to improve from 2021 levels.\nSales in Medication Delivery of $784 million increased 6% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects continued recovery in the pace of hospital admissions compared to pre-COVID levels as well as increased demand for large volume infusion pumps and small volume parenterals. For the year, we estimate that U.S. hospital admissions were down mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID levels.\nPharmaceutical sales of $604 million advanced 8% on a constant currency basis and 2% operationally. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our international pharmacy compounding business, growth in anesthesia as our international markets continue to recover from COVID-19 and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx, Doxil. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. generic injectables portfolio business related to lower surgical procedures and increased competitive activity for certain molecules.\nMoving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $249 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of new product launches within our broad multi-chamber product offering.\nSales in Advanced Surgery were $255 million or flat on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we saw a strong growth in some of our international businesses. But this was offset by performance in the U.S. as surgical procedures, particularly in the second half of December, came in below our expectations due to the impact from pandemic along with staffing shortages.\nSales in our Acute Therapies business were $202 million, declining 7% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a challenging year-over-year comparison. Despite this, performance in the quarter did exceed our expectations as we continue to see elevated demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases associated with new variants.\nBioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $145 million, representing growth of 31% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, which totaled approximately $50 million in the quarter.\nWhile our results only include Hillrom's financial results for the final 19 days of the quarter, for transparency and completeness, we're providing some sales commentary for Hillrom's full quarter ended December 31, which would have represented their first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unaudited Hillrom sales for the full quarter were $724 million. Sales in the quarter reflect a difficult comparison from prior year period following the exit of the international surgical OEM business as well as significant supply constraints, which impacted Hillrom's ability to ship products within the quarter.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 44.3% increased by 290 basis points over the prior year, reflecting the favorable product mix, operational improvements in manufacturing and the contribution from Hillrom to our financial results.\nAdjusted SG&A of $710 million increased 14% as compared to the prior year and represented 20.2 as a percentage of sales. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $133 million increased 1% versus the prior year and represented 3.8 as a percent of sales. Adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both include the incremental contribution from Hillrom.\nIn addition, adjusted SG&A expense in the quarter reflects the higher freight expenses we absorbed in the quarter as well as higher bonus accruals compared to the prior year under our annual employee incentive compensation plan. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 20.3%, an increase of 260 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the factors I just mentioned.\nAdjusted net interest expense totaled $44 million in the quarter, an increase of $6 million versus prior year driven by higher outstanding debt balances related to the financing of the Hillrom acquisition. Other nonoperating expense totaled $21 million in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior year period.\nFourth quarter 2021 reflects unplanned expenses related to foreign exchange losses from our subsidiary in Turkey as a result of the devaluation of the Turkish lira as well as an unrealized loss on an equity investment. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18.5%, above our expectations driven primarily by the mix of earnings in the quarter. The tax rate in the quarter also reflects the inclusion of Hillrom's income, which carries a higher tax rate than legacy Baxter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share advanced 30% versus the prior year period.\nTurning to full year 2021. Sales of $12.8 billion increased by 10% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 5% operationally. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 17% to $3.61 per diluted share.\nOn a full year basis, we generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. Throughout 2021, we remain focused on strategically redeploying capital to advance our performance and position Baxter for future success.\nWe returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and deployed over $12 billion to inorganic investments to fuel growth, including our acquisition of Hillrom. With the acquisition now closed, our capital allocation priority will be to aggressively delever through the next 2 years to reach our net leverage target of 2.75x by year 2 post close.\nLet me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, including some key assumptions around phasing for the year. We currently anticipate that many of the factors that impacted our fourth quarter results, including increased inflationary fractures, supply chain disruptions, staffing challenges across our manufacturing network and ongoing impact of the pandemic, will continue to weigh on performance with the anticipated impact expected to be most pronounced in the first quarter.\nWe're working expeditiously to address order backlog and anticipate a strong ramp in sales into the second quarter and the remainder of 2022 driven by new product launches and easing of COVID-19 dynamics globally. In addition, we're continuing to implement actions to increase operational effectiveness within our integrated supply chain network as well as evaluating opportunities to pass through certain costs in select geographies.\nWe anticipate these actions, coupled with the improving sales performance, will result in meaningful margin expansion and earnings growth for the company, particularly in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of 2022. Given these dynamics for the first quarter of '22, we expect global sales growth of 24% to 25% on a reported basis, 27% to 28% on a constant currency basis and low single-digit revenue growth on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.79 to $0.82 per diluted share.\nFor full year 2022, we expect global sales growth of 24% to 25% on a reported basis, 26% to 27% on a constant currency basis and approximately 4% on an operational basis.\nMoving down the P&L, we expect adjusted operating margin for the year of approximately 19% with first half margins below this estimate and second half margins above as we expect performance to significantly improve throughout the year. For the year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 19% and expect diluted average share count to stay consistent with 508 million shares exiting 2021. Based on these factors, we expect 2022 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share.\nWith that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

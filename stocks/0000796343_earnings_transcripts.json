Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Day, SVP DX, CFO, and Corporate Finance, Interim Head of IR. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Day\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Shantanu Narayen, Adobe's Chair and CEO, David Wadhwani, President of Digital Media, Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience, and Dan Durn, Executive Vice President and CFO. On this call, which is being recorded, we will discuss Adobe's first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results. You can find our press release, as well as PDFs of our prepared remarks and financial results, on Adobe's Investor Relations website.\nThe information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans, is as of today, 12 March 2025, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For more information on those risks, please review today's earnings release and Adobe's SEC filings. On this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur reported results include GAAP growth rates, as well as constant currency rates. During this presentation, Adobe's executives will refer to constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Non-GAAP reconciliations are available in our earnings release and on Adobe's Investor Relations website.\nI will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe hit a record first quarter. We achieved $5.71 billion US dollar in revenue in Q1, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $4.14 US dollar, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $5.08 US dollar, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Our performance reflects the ongoing critical role that Adobe products play in powering the global digital economy. In addition, given Q1 performance, we are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal 2025 targets. Next week is Adobe Summit, our flagship digital experience conference, where we will unveil the latest innovations across our portfolio.\nIn addition, we will host our annual investor meeting on 18 March 2025, and we wanted to preview what we will share about our growth strategy. Adobe's success over the past decade has been driven by the exponential growth of the creative economy and the customer-focused innovations we've delivered across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Our groundbreaking solutions are empowering an ever-expanding universe of users to imagine, create, and deliver standout content that drives exceptional experiences.\nAdobe's mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences is more critical than ever, as digital continues to rapidly transform work, life, education, and entertainment. AI represents a generational opportunity to reimagine our technology platforms to serve an increasingly large and diverse customer universe. With creativity at the core, we have been evolving our offerings and routes to market to anticipate the distinct needs of creative professionals and next-generation creators, marketing professionals, agencies, and enterprises, and the broader set of consumers and business professionals.\nWe believe this will drive continued growth and profitability. Creative professionals and creators need power and precision to bring their ideas to life across any media type. The next generation of creators want the flexibility of web and mobile tools, in addition to the power of the desktop. They will benefit from the variety of AI models to ideate and explore creative possibilities. Adobe will serve this growing community with the most comprehensive set of web, mobile, and desktop applications, delivered through various subscription tiers.\nIn addition to Creative Cloud, we will offer new Firefly web app subscriptions that integrate and are an on-ramp for our web and mobile products. While Adobe's commercially safe Firefly models will be integral to this offering, we will support additional third-party models to be part of this creative process. The Firefly app will be the umbrella destination for new creative categories, like ideation.\nWe recently introduced and incorporated our new Firefly video model into this offering, adding to the already supported image, vector, and design models. In addition to monetizing standalone subscriptions for Firefly, we will introduce multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Marketing professionals need to create an unprecedented volume of compelling content and optimize it to deliver personalized digital experiences across channels, including mobile applications, email, social media, and advertising platforms.\nThey're looking for agility and self-service, as well as integrated workflows with their creative teams and agencies. To achieve this, enterprises require custom, commercially safe models, and agents tailored to address the inefficiencies of the content supply chain. With Adobe GenStudio Firefly Services, adobe is transforming how brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns, unlocking new levels of creativity, personalization, and efficiency.\nThe combination of the Adobe Experience Platform and apps in Adobe GenStudio is the most comprehensive marketing platform to deliver on this vision. In addition to our direct sales force, we will leverage an ecosystem of partners and agencies to sell, implement, operate, and deliver business outcomes to companies of all sizes. We have accelerated One Adobe deals by increasingly integrating our creative and marketing products into a single enterprise solution.\nWe will continue to invest in sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education, and government. Business professionals and consumers want ease of use across web and mobile through a freemium model. They're looking for quick and easy, AI-first, category-defining creative applications to help them stand out. While the need for creative expression continues to grow exponentially, the real value is in integrating creativity and productivity in an all-in-one solution.\nThe combination of Express and Acrobat is Adobe's opportunity to make the journey from document creation to consumption smoother than ever. AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader, and Express will accelerate the delivery of new conversational and agentic interfaces to add value to this combined offering. Revenue growth will be driven by distribution across web and mobile app stores, partnerships with major software providers, and focus on SMB and enterprise sales.\nOur generative AI innovation is infused across the breadth of our products, and its impact is influencing billions of ARR across acquisition, retention, and value expansion, as customers benefit from these new capabilities. This strength is also reflected in our AI-first standalone and add-on products such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly app and services, and GenStudio for performance marketing, which have already contributed greater than $125 million US dollar book of business exiting Q1 fiscal 2025, and we expect this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.\nIn summary, by leveraging the breadth of our products and technology platforms in the era of AI, and delivering new tailored offerings and solutions by customer groups, we will drive the engine of growth for the next decade. We will win by focusing on business professionals and consumers, and creative and marketing professionals, with a unified product strategy and go-to-market. We will start to provide financial visibility in these two new groups starting this quarter, and expand on this at our Investor Day at Summit next week.\nI'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $4.23 billion US dollar, which grew 12% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with $17.63 billion US dollar of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 12.6% year-over-year. We continue to see healthy performance in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Creative growth was driven by broad-based adoption across our routes to market and product portfolio, with particular strengths in new offerings Firefly Services, an increasing number of one Adobe deals, and a growing base of web and mobile users.\nDocument Cloud continued to see strong organic demand, continued optimizations in free-to-pay conversion journeys, and AI Assistant being released in additional languages. We drove strong performance across digital media in emerging markets. The results represent a good start to the fiscal year. Creativity is going mainstream, and I want to provide more color on the audiences we serve.\nWe live in a visual-first world where creative expression has become pervasive in every facet of life. Business professionals and consumers alike aim to produce visually rich, engaging content, whether it's a presentation, birthday invitation, or social post. At the same time, creative professionals, creators, and marketers are competing on the quality of their online presence and the personalized experiences they deliver to customers. They turn to Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud to achieve their content goals.\nGoing forward, as a result of AI advancements, we see incredible opportunity to serve customers with audience-specific offerings. Business professionals and consumers are increasingly benefiting from deep integration between Acrobat, Express, and Firefly, while creative professionals, creators, and marketers are investing in powerful workflows across Creative Cloud, our new web and mobile creative applications, Firefly, and GenStudio.\nPDF continues to be the global standard for digital documents for business professionals, and Adobe Acrobat is revolutionizing the way people engage with them across mobile, web, and desktop. Features like AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader have been a game changer for everyone from sales teams to students looking for faster insights and smarter document editing. The ability to share links and collect comments has increased document productivity and helped drive additional adoption.\nThese new capabilities and our cross-surface investments have paid off, with Acrobat and Reader monthly active usage growing 23% year-over-year. Our success with Acrobat has also shown us that whether for a sales presentation, a school project, or a social media post, business professionals and consumers are looking for an easy-to-use solution that helps them create visually compelling content that stands out from the crowd of generic templates.\nIn fact, a significant number of all documents created in Acrobat are visual documents, things like marketing content, sales pitches, presentations, infographics, and cover pages. We're making good progress in addressing this need by embedding Express capabilities as a native experience in Acrobat, with the goal of boosting productivity and making the journey from document consumption to content creation smoother than ever.\nThe integration of Adobe Express features in Acrobat allows users to create richer PDFs with AI-generated cover pages, embedded infographics, and customized images, and empowers users to create fully formed animated videos and other rich digital output. We see numerous early indicators of user demand as Express usage through Acrobat has grown 10x year-over-year.\nOther highlights for business professionals and consumers include Acrobat AI Assistant support for languages now includes English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese. Acrobat AI Assistant support for legal workflows with contract-specific features.\nNew AI capabilities in Express, like Clipmaker, for auto-generation of video highlights and text rewrite to help produce more effective copy. Expanded Acrobat integrations with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Gmail, and Google Drive, and strong adoption of link sharing for richer collaborative experiences have led to approximately 50% year-over-year growth in Acrobat web monthly active usage. Expanded Express integrations now include Miro, Box, Slack, Webflow, and HubSpot.\nThe Express ecosystem also expanded to 225 plugins, more than doubling in the last year. Strong business and student adoption. Express onboarded nearly 6,000 new businesses in Q1, representing approximately 50% quarter-over-quarter growth. Students with access to Express Premium grew 85% year-over-year. Key global customer wins include AT&T, Delta Airlines, Disney, Ernst & Young, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Paramount, and Qatar Airlines.\nCreative professionals and the next generation of creators who make their living by designing and producing content are focused on standing out and bringing their unique creative visions to life with pixel-perfect precision. As we mark the 35th anniversary of Photoshop, Adobe Creative applications remain the solutions of choice for the world's creative professionals across imaging, design, photography, video, illustration, and 3D. We also see increasing demand from the next generation of creators who are looking for freemium web and mobile applications as they begin their creative journeys.\nTo better serve these users, we launched a new Photoshop mobile app and an expanded web experience, delivering Photoshop's iconic image editing and design capabilities on the iPhone. The mobile app and all-new web experience are also included in current Photoshop plans, offering established Photoshop customers a flexible ecosystem to create and edit across surfaces.\nThe launch garnered over 30 million social engagements in just two weeks. The release of the Adobe Firefly video model in February, a commercially safe generative AI video model, has been very positively received by brands and creative professionals who have already started using it to create production-ready content. Users can generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles to control shots, create distinct scenes with 3D sketches, craft atmospheric elements, and develop custom motion design elements.\nWe're thrilled to see creative professionals in enterprises and agencies, including dentsu, PepsiCo, and Stagwell, finding success with the video model. Additionally, we recently launched an all-new Firefly application, the most comprehensive destination to generate images, vectors, and now videos, with unmatched creative control and direct integration with our industry-leading creative apps to seamlessly move from ideation to production.\nIn addition to generating images, videos, and designs from text, the app lets you generate videos from keyframes, use 3D designs to precisely direct generations, and translate audio and video into multiple languages. We also launched two new plans as part of this release, Firefly Standard, and Firefly Pro, and began the rollout of our third plan, Firefly Premium, yesterday. User engagement has been strong, with over 90% of paid users generating videos.\nThe launch of Photoshop on web and mobile, and the release of the new Firefly application, expands our growing family of web and mobile products, which now includes Photoshop for creative imaging, Lightroom for photography, Express for design, and Firefly for ideation and early production. These apps serve as value-added capabilities to our existing paid subscribers, and as a frictionless freemium onboarding experience to attract and monetize next-generation creators.\nWe're delighted with the early interest in these new offerings. Other creative professional and creator highlights include continued strong adoption of Gen AI in our products, with Photoshop Gen AI monthly active users at approximately 35% and Lightroom Gen AI monthly active users at 30%. Users have generated over 20 billion assets with Firefly.\nThe introduction of new features in Premiere Pro Beta and After Effects Beta are helping editors and motion designers stay ahead of deadlines with AI features like Media Intelligence, which helps users find footage faster using natural language, and Caption Translation for 17 languages, which effortlessly expand video to global audiences. We're honored to see visionary filmmakers around the world telling the season's most acclaimed stories using Adobe Creative applications, including Academy Award winners \"Anora\" and \"Dune: Part Two\".\nThe launch of adaptive profiles and distraction removal in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Camera RAW, which reduced tedious and repetitive tasks. MAX Japan brought our community together and served as an opportunity for us to launch a number of new innovations, including performance improvements in Adobe Illustrator, which accelerate features like pan and zoom, and loading large files up to 10x faster.\nWe had another great quarter in the enterprise, with more customers turning Firefly Services and custom models to scale on-brand content production for marketing use cases, including leading brands such as Deloitte Digital, IBM, IPG Health, Mattel, and Tapestry. Tapestry, for example, has implemented a new and highly productive digital twin workflow using custom models in Firefly. You'll hear more on how the combination of creativity and marketing is powering personalization at scale in enterprises.\nAdobe is incredibly well set up to take advantage of AI across creativity. We're rapidly delivering tailored innovations to serve the full continuum of content creation for business professionals and consumers, creative professionals and creators, and marketing professionals. Our expanding breadth of offerings is reaching a broader universe of customers, and our incredible go-to-market strength and proven data-driven operating model are propelling the growth of both flagship and new offerings. We will be unveiling more exciting product capabilities at Adobe Summit and MAX London in April.\nI'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. Experience Cloud had a strong Q1, achieving revenue of $1.41 billion US dollar for the quarter. Subscription revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion US dollar, representing 11% year-over-year growth. Our leading solutions, spanning content, data, and customer journeys, enable enterprises around the world to deliver personalized experiences at scale, helping customers drive both top-line growth and productivity gains. In Q1, we delivered typical seasonal bookings and advanced our pipeline as enterprise customers initiated the execution of their critical 2025 priorities.\nAdobe Experience Platform and apps play a pivotal role in enabling unified customer experiences. With the addition of AEP AI Assistant, we extended the value and impact of Experience Platform by empowering more functions across the business with conversational interfaces for data ingestion, insight generation, audience segmentation, and experience delivery.\nWe're now building on these advances and expanding AEP to enable intelligent orchestration of customer experiences with AI agents natively built in. We're empowering customers to make better use of their first-party data, and to drive more relevant ad experiences based on direct customer relationships. Our portfolio spans the entire content supply chain, from creation and production, workflow and planning, asset management, delivery and activation, through to reporting and insights.\nNow we're bringing together creativity and marketing with AI to help our customers realize the full potential of personalization at scale. Up to now, marketing professionals have been constrained by the number of content variations they can create and the number of journeys they can deploy. With Adobe GenStudio, brands around the globe have been working with Adobe to bring creative and marketing teams closer together, simplify their creation-to-activation process, and unlock new levels of creativity, insights, and efficiency in marketing campaigns.\nOther highlights include strong demand for Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, with Q1 subscription revenue growing nearly 50% year-on-year. Release of real-time CDP collaboration, delivering a secure environment for advertisers and publishers to jointly discover, activate, and measure high-value audiences for more relevant campaigns. Built on AEP, real-time CDP collaboration is purpose-built for brands to connect and collaborate on first-party data.\nUsers can now measure ad effectiveness directly with publishers, including NBC Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery. Advertisers and agencies, including Alterra Mountain Company, GroupM Wavemaker, Major League Baseball, and The Coca-Cola Company, piloted the solution to deliver personalized and performant ads.\nLaunch of the AEM Cloud Service Accelerator with Publicis Sapient, which can reduce the labor cost of migration up to 35%. Industry analyst recognition in major analyst reports, including the Gartner Magic Quadrant for digital experience platforms, and Gartner Magic Quadrant for personalization engines. Strong demand Firefly Services and custom models as part of the GenStudio solution, with over 1,400 custom models since launch.\nGenStudio for performance marketing wins at leading brands, including AT&T, Lennar, Lenovo, Lumen, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Red Hat, Thai Airways, and University of Phoenix. Strong partnership momentum with GenStudio for performance marketing, supporting ad creation and activation for Google, Meta, Microsoft Ads, Snap, and TikTok, and several partners, including Accenture, EY, IPG Health, Merkle, and PwC, offering vertical extension apps. Partnership with dentsu to bring Gen AI from playground to production for our joint customers with Adobe GenStudio dentsu+.\nKey global customer wins, including Delta Airlines, Ford, IBM, M.H. Alshaya, Microsoft, PNC Financial Services, and Tyson Foods. These customer wins address the ongoing evolution of the requirements of global brands for an integrated workflow spanning creativity and marketing. This success is driven by product integration and innovation across Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud, increasingly delivered through Adobe GenStudio.\nOur One Adobe Enterprise Go-to-Market Engine enables customers to deliver personalized and on-brand content at scale. The combination of our integrated enterprise solutions across creativity and marketing is a unique strength for Adobe. Next week, we're excited to host Adobe Summit, our flagship digital experience conference in Las Vegas, where we'll be joined by thousands of customers, partners, and developers from around the world.\nWe will share our vision for how brands can apply the power of generative AI and agentic technology to achieve personalization at scale, and look forward to highlighting a number of product innovations.\nI'll now pass it to Dan.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Adobe's business has grown over the last decade by delivering world-class products grouped within three clouds: Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. In parallel, we've continued to expand cross-cloud offerings to better serve different customer groups. Examples include Acrobat, which is reflected in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud; GenStudio, which includes Creative Cloud, Firefly Services, and Experience Cloud; enterprises who want to engage with One Adobe and combine creative seats with marketing automation; and, increasingly, Acrobat and Express.\nWe believe Adobe's success will be driven by innovation in service of both business professionals and consumers, and creative and marketing professionals. Reporting insights and the financial performance across these customer groups will provide a clear view of Adobe's execution against our strategy. We will therefore provide overall Adobe revenue, digital media and digital experience segment revenue, digital experience subscription revenue, and digital media ending ARR in aggregate rather than by cloud, as well as subscription revenue for business professionals and consumers, and creative and marketing professionals.\nSubscription revenue provided will primarily include revenue from SaaS, managed services, and term offerings. Business professionals and consumers group will consist of all subscription revenue from Document Cloud, Acrobat subscription revenue and Creative Cloud, and Adobe Express subscription revenue and Creative Cloud, all of which are a part of digital media. Creative and marketing professionals group will consist of all subscription revenue from digital experience, as well as all of the remaining subscription revenue from Creative Cloud in digital media.\nIn today's call, I'll cover three main areas: our Q1 FY 2025 results focusing on key growth drivers, financial targets, and our supplemental disclosures.\nNow, turning to the quarter. In the first quarter of FY 2025, Adobe achieved revenue of $5.71 billion US dollar, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 11% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $4.14 US dollar, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.08 US dollar. Q1 business and financial highlights included digital media revenue of $4.23 billion US dollar, digital media ending ARR of $17.63 billion US dollar, growing 12.6% year-over-year, digital experience revenue of $1.41 billion US dollar, and cash flows from operations of $2.48 billion US dollar.\nExiting the quarter, remaining performance obligations were $19.69 billion US dollar, growing 12% year-over-year, and cRPO growing 11%. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $4.23 billion US dollar, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 12% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $17.63 billion US dollar of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 12.6% year-over-year in constant currency.\nFirst quarter digital media growth drivers included strong growth for Acrobat across all routes to market and geographies, Acrobat web and mobile growth driven by freemium funnel and app store optimizations, growth in Adobe Express fueled by top-of-funnel improvements, PLG journeys across Acrobat and Express, and B2B customer onboarding, strength in user adoption and engagement of Acrobat AI Assistant driven by expansion of features, including support for additional languages and contract intelligence capabilities,\ngrowth of creative flagship offerings driven by all apps, stock, imaging, and photography, continued momentum in creative web and mobile offerings with 35% year-over-year ending paid subscription growth, and strong momentum in the enterprise driven by Firefly Services and the continued benefit from the upsell motion of generative AI-enabled offerings. Turning to our digital experience segment, in Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.41 billion US dollar, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency.\nDigital experience subscription revenue was $1.30 billion US dollar, growing 11% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. First quarter digital experience growth drivers included momentum for product offerings across content, data, and journeys, AEP and app subscription revenue growing nearly 50% year-on-year, GenStudio solutions surpassing $1 billion US dollar in ending ARR book of business, early momentum in GenStudio for performance marketing, adoption, and pipeline, and improvements in overall enterprise retention.\nTurning now to our customer group performance, Creative and marketing professionals group subscription revenue was $3.92 billion US dollar, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported. Business professionals and consumers group subscription revenue was $1.53 billion US dollar, which represents 15% year-over-year growth as reported. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 17.0% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nRPO exiting the quarter was $19.69 billion US dollar, growing 12% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency, and CRPO growing 11% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Our cash flows from operations in the quarter were a Q1 record $2.48 billion US dollar, and ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $7.44 billion US dollar. In Q1, we entered into share repurchase agreements totaling $3.25 billion US dollar, and we currently have $14.4 billion US dollar remaining of our $25 billion US dollar authorization granted in March 2024.\nLet me now turn to our Q2 FY 2025 financial targets. For Q2 FY 2025, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.77 billion US dollar to 5.82 billion US dollar, digital media segment revenue of $4.27 billion US dollar to 4.30 billion US dollar, digital experience segment revenue of $1.43 billion US dollar to 1.45 billion US dollar, digital experience subscription revenue of $1.315 billion US dollar to 1.325 billion US dollar, GAAP earnings per share of $3.80 US dollar to 3.85 US dollar, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.95 US dollar to $5 US dollar.\nFor Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%. The year is off to a good start, and assuming current macroeconomic conditions, I'm pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance for fiscal year 2025. This quarter's strong performance reflects Adobe's long-standing focus on innovation and meeting the growing needs of our broad customer base. As businesses increasingly prioritize digital transformation, we're uniquely positioned to deliver value through our highly differentiated solutions and proven go-to-market execution to unleash the power of creativity.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to drive growth for our customers as we continue to shape the future in the era of AI. We look forward to seeing you next week at our investor meeting at Summit 2025. Thank you, and we'll now take questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touchstone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star one if you would like to signal with questions.\nThe first question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nSenior Technology Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon. Shantanu, if you took the AI book of business, it would be low single-digit percent of your total revenue for the year. I guess many are asking, when does this become more material? How long does it take? What is required? Maybe just help us walk through the AI journey and how that translates to revenue.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nHappy to, Brent. If you take a step back and think about it, we've always talked about the AI journey as three parts. The first is ensuring that we innovate. The second is all about tracking usage, ensuring value, and monetization. I would say we're really pleased across all three of those journeys. We've had conversations with you folks as well in the past.\nA significant amount of the AI monetization is also happening in terms of attracting people to our subscription, making sure they're retained, and having them drive higher value price SKUs. When somebody buys Creative Cloud or when somebody buys Document Cloud, in effect, they are actually monetizing AI. In addition to that, Brent, what we wanted to do was give you a flavor for the new standalone products that we have.\nWhen we talked about introducing Acrobat AI Assistant and rolling that out in different languages, Firefly, and making sure that we have a new subscription model associated with that on the Firefly Services for the enterprise, and GenStudio, the $125 million US dollar book of business that we talked about exiting Q1 only relates to that new book of business.\nThat's, again, stuff that we said we would double. I think in terms of the impact also on the overall business, that has had a material part. If you play this out a little bit more and you talk about what investors can expect, I think with the new Firefly app that's come out, this is a web product with a new subscription ability to have the video model, ability to have ideation as part of it.\nThink of it as integrating Photoshop Web, Express Web, and all of the other products. All of that is also upside. You'll see a lot more innovation in that area, and you'll see a lot more monetization in that area. Again, the last thing I'll probably say, Brent, is that the whole idea was to start to tee it up and then at the FA meeting to continue to expand on how that is. Net-net, I would say, whether it's innovation, having our own models, integrating it across all of our products, brand new revenue streams like GenStudio in the enterprise, and then usage and monetization, I feel really good about it.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nSenior Technology Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks, Shantanu.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Research, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. Wanted to double-click into the demand linearity you saw in the quarter. I appreciate the commentary reaffirming 11% digital media ARR growth guide for the full year. Can you provide more color on trends you saw in the quarter across Creative and Document Clouds here? Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, happy to do that. Again, digital media ARR was 12.6% growth, which is in line with our expectation, and also the mix was in line with our expectations. If you take a step back and you look at the demand and sort of the way the business played out this quarter, it's consistent with what we've seen historically, and we've seen sort of a broad-based demand for the products, with a few highlights that I think are worth calling out.\nFirst of all, as it comes to business professionals and consumers, this is obviously a huge market with billions of users that we're going after. Our strategy here is to really make sure that productivity, that we deliver a solution for productivity from consumption all the way to creation. That's really what we're doing with Acrobat and Express.\nWe saw a lot of momentum in these businesses. We talked about how Acrobat is up 23% year-over-year in terms of monthly active users. We're seeing stronger conversion on those users, and that's been helping drive the business. AI Assistant, obviously, we introduced that last year, continues to do very well, and it's certainly helping with that strategy of faster consumption and conversational experiences. We saw 2x quarter-over-quarter usage growth in AI Assistant.\nIn that context, Express has been a great product. The product right now is just it's an amazing product to use. That also we've been investing in very significantly from a marketing standpoint, but also from a partnership standpoint. We've doubled the partner ecosystem in the last year. It now includes new names like Miro, Box, Webflow, and HubSpot.\nWe have 85% more access, 85% year-over-year growth in students with access to it. We've been ramping up our student and campus ambassador programs. We added 6,000 new small-medium businesses to the Express product as well. Even within Acrobat, where we've been doing more, we're seeing much more demand. We saw 10x year-over-year engagement of Express capabilities from Acrobat users. Feeling really good about that audience group.\nOn the Creative Pro and Creator side, Shantanu New mentioned this already, but the introduction of the Firefly video model being used by dentsu, PepsiCo, and Stagwell, Firefly new offerings from standard to pro. Just yesterday, we introduced a premium, which is a much larger set of generative credits, and all of those represent new monetization models. We introduced Photoshop, mobile, and web. We saw hundreds of articles, 30 million social engagements.\nWe were just listed as the app-focused app on the App Store over the weekend. We saw some great new advances for AI coming into Lightroom, web, and mobile. Premiere also saw some great advances in terms of AI. Lots of momentum in that business. What's really exciting is that as we've done all of this innovation, as Shantanu was talking about, we also have three big milestones coming up with Summit next week, NAB shortly after that, and Max London shortly after that.\nThis is starting to show up. Obviously, we've talked about generations. We crossed 20 billion generations. We're doing more than 1 billion generations now a month. Ninety percent of people using Firefly, the app, are also generating video as well as part of that. We also saw strong growth in the enterprise.\nI don't know if Anil, if you want to add something.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nYeah, exactly. To just echo what you were saying, I think in the enterprise, we see a lot of demand for creativity, marketing, and AI coming together. Every CMO that we talk to, every agency that we work with, they're all very interested in how generative AI can be used to transform how the content supply chain works. With the GenStudio offering, which combines the creativity, the marketing, and the AI, we've seen tremendous traction. We saw a number of both customer wins, as well as a number of agency partners. We look forward to unveiling a lot more of this at Summit.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nOff to a great start, I think, with innovation, new offerings, and you can expect to see new offerings and tiers in the months ahead.\n\nBrent Bracelin\n\nHead of Technology Research, Piper Sandler\n\nWell, look forward to talking to you next week. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Thank you for the additional disclosure. I think it's a really interesting view, kind of breaking down the creative and marketing professionals versus the business professionals and consumer group.\nKind of following on that last question, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels kind of bullish to me that the business professionals and consumer group has a stronger growth rate, creative at 15%, creative and marketing professionals a little bit behind because it feels like business professionals and consumer group, those products would be faster sales cycle, particularly on the consumer side of the equation, faster adoption.\nThe creative and marketing professionals, this broader solution that you're trying to sell would have longer sales cycle. The question is, am I thinking about that right? Are you seeing any indications that that creative and marketing professional group, whether it's in your pipelines or sort of the activity you're seeing, could that catch up with what we're seeing from the business professionals and consumer group?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, Keith, I mean, part of our goal was really to start to provide insight into, by the customer groups, how we're starting to see it. To some degree, when people are wondering how we are actually driving creative, the reality is that when you think about the GenStudio set of products, which we now said is a billion-dollar book of business, AP and apps is also a billion-dollar book of business.\nThe creative professional, that's actually addressing the entire content supply chain. In terms of that growth rate, as we add new subscriptions like the Firefly app subscription, add more video, add more functionality in what we are doing with GenStudio, that growth rate as well, it's a very large untapped opportunity.\nPeople have been asking us questions about the strength of the creative market as well as the strength of that market within the enterprise. We think that's a large TAM. We'll share more. I think you're thinking of it right, which is to say the $5 billion US dollar book of business that we built for digital marketing, that's really helping the content and the creative economy. That was the idea behind giving you a window into that.\nThe metrics associated with that are subscription and different kinds of offerings. On the other side of the equation as well, to your point, what we wanted to do was reflect the fact that the investments that we made in both Acrobat and Express, continuing to ensure distribution when we think about the monthly average users.\nIf you take it in aggregate, I mean, Adobe has hundreds of millions of people who are using our products. That will be really the early metrics and the indicators of how Express and Acrobat continue to grow. I'm glad that you found the additional disclosure beneficial. That was the idea. To Brent's earlier question as well, I just wanted to clarify.\nI mean, we are not taking all of the revenue that we see in digital media and digital experience and calling that AI revenue. Relative to what I've seen from any other company in our particular space, we've actually been pleased by how much of it, whether it's additional tiers of AI in the digital experience or what we are seeing across Acrobat as well as the creative professional space, there's been good adoption of AI in that. That was the other intent, to start to show that so that we can talk about it more at the FA meeting.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOutstanding. Can I sneak one in for Mr. Durn? It's great to see you guys take advantage of the pullback in the stock price by accelerating the share repurchase, which picked up this quarter. Could this pace of share repurchases, can you guys sustain this throughout the year, or is that more of a one-time pickup?\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. If I take a step back, Keith, and you think about the last four quarters, we've repurchased almost $11 billion US dollar. We've always talked about if there's opportunities to be opportunistic along the way, we would take advantage of it. I think that's what you saw play out in Q1. We've got a strong point of view about the financial profile throughout the course of the year.\nHappy to reaffirm guidance, but we're going to drive that with strong operating margins, strong cash flow delivery, and be strong capital allocators throughout the year. We feel good about where we sit. If there's opportunities to be opportunistic, we will.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThank you. This is definitely a vote of confidence that we feel in what we are seeing as the opportunities ahead of us.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nHead of US Software Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, it's great to see you guys putting your money where your mouth is by accelerating that share repurchase. It definitely helps.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much. Much appreciate the disclosure, the color, and everything that goes with it. Shantanu, quick question for you. When you pivoted the company to a new business model through cloud, initially, there was a lot of skepticism. You proved to us that the TAM was actually larger in the new creative meets the cloud cycle.\nThe company was able to accelerate through the transition and put up even better margins by expanding the TAM necessarily. As you look at AI right now, right now, one bearish argument that one could make, which I don't subscribe to, is that you're playing defense and that AI is a cost of staying in business and keeping yourself relevant to your creative base. How do you look, since you've been through this one big shift before? You've got a lot of experience.\nWhere's your conviction on how truly incremental AI can be for your growth? Could we be at a similar junction where you're poised to get into the next cycle? It's actually a bigger time, not put words in your mouth, but even maybe, dare I say, the potential to accelerate off of the good growth that we've seen so far. Thank you so much.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, Kash, what I appreciate about the question is this is what we wanted to really tee up in front of the FA meeting. Without a doubt, as David described, the opportunity for the business professional and consumers, I think you'll start to see, and we'll share more at the FA meeting, that there are billions of people that we can bring into the fold for creativity and productivity, and talk more about how we're, with the distribution that we have and with the monthly average users that we have, monetize that much like we've monetized Acrobat.\nWe definitely believe that it's a massive, massive opportunity. I think it's the same thing across creatives. There are more creatives that are entering. I'll preview a little bit of what David will share, which is when you think about the web and mobile offerings that we're providing to attract more people to our platform as creative professionals and next-generation creators, the number of people who want to enter that profession is significantly larger than it's ever been.\nWith products like Photoshop on web and mobile as well as Firefly app, that's clearly the intent to show how that as a subscription service and attracting the next-generation creators will be a tailwind. When you put this together in the enterprise, I mean, hopefully what you also see as part of the additional disclosures is that the enterprises continue to be a material part of our business, and a material part of our growth, because they are, in order to do personalization at scale, as Anil is talking about, there's going to be more content that's produced.\nThere's going to be more content that's actually inserted into ad systems and social media. Again, I think setting the stage for how that's a larger opportunity. If you look at it from not just the length of we were marketing, but look at the lens of, hey, that's a content business for us in the enterprise, we will again outline how that is only going to be a growing opportunity.\nNo question in my mind, all three of these are actually going to accelerate in terms of the TAM, and then we have to innovate and execute against that. I am more excited about the larger opportunity, without a doubt, as a result of AI. We've talked about this, Kash. If you don't take advantage of AI, it's a disruption. In our particular case, the intent is clearly to show how it's a tailwind.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nExcellent. One follow-up and very quick one, I promise if I can. With the turbulence in the markets with trade wars, tariffs, etc., how do you feel your customer base is going to behave? Is everything going to be on track from what you can tell by talking to your customers, or are they kind of perplexed by what's going on and pausing? Thank you so much. That's it for me.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, I mean, I think we just sort of said, assuming current macroeconomic conditions, I mean, we have a diverse business. We're off to a good start in the conversations that we're having. All of us have conversations with all of our other peers. I think we have a seasoned management team that will navigate it. Customers, I think we're all jointly trying to understand what happens in the economy. The tariffs, etc., don't really impact Adobe the way they impact other businesses. We are optimistic.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nVP of Global Software Research, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much. Dan, can you give us more color on why you're changing the categorization of revenue, removing the historical Document Cloud and Creative Cloud? Is this driven by the One Adobe sales motion? Is Express now sold predominantly with Document Cloud? How should we think about the drivers? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Mark. As we laid it out, we talked about increasingly driving cross-cloud offerings. We're already doing it today. We're going to be doing more of it going forward. As you look at individuals increasingly buying offerings, as you look at enterprises increasingly buying solutions and bringing different parts of our portfolio together to meet their highest value needs around these two groupings of the customers, it really is meant to just draw a highlight to our strategy and how we're executing against that strategy on a go-forward basis.\nOur success is going to be driven by the way we innovate into the intersection of productivity and creativity, into the intersection of creativity and marketing. Those intersections are highlighted by these two groupings of customers. The intent around this is to really bring to life how we're driving our strategy, how we're executing against it, provides the best insight in how the company is performing on a go-forward basis.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe",
    "content2": "Mark, at least two specific things that we've heard as feedback from all of you folks are you understand that there's Acrobat within Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. This pulls out the business in order to show the momentum and the opportunity in that business. To your question about one Adobe, yes. I mean, the GenStudio solution is without a doubt taking seats of products like Photoshop or Creative Cloud. It's adding Express in it for every marketer in there.\nWe Firefly Services and custom models. The more we sell that as one enterprise offering and we want to accelerate the sale of that as a strategic partnership, that's now also all reflected in one of those revenue slices. We believe that the additional disclosure will also give you more visibility into routes to market.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nVP of Global Software Research, Bernstein\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. One quick other one. Should we expect the disclosure on the AI ARR, something that we'll be getting quarterly or periodically updated?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nPeriodically.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nVP of Global Software Research, Bernstein\n\nOkay. You'd like it quarterly. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nAleksandr Zukin\n\nManaging Director Software Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, guys, for taking the question. I will join the chorus of those commenting positively on some of the new numbers, particularly the AI book of business. That's where I wanted to ask the question. Basically, you're going to give us a number.\nWe're going to ask for more. In that spirit, if you look at the $125 million US dollar and you think about the segmentation between Assistant, Firefly, GenStudio, is there any triangulation around maybe what the percentages are for the breakout of those, and maybe stack rank the growth rates that are going to get you to double that by the end of the year? Kind of similarly, if you think about if that $125 million US dollar is impacting or where the tailwinds are more towards the creative and marketing professional or the business professionals.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Great question, Alex. First of all, if you look at the mix of these things, AI Assistant has been around for about three or four quarters now. Firefly service has been around for about four quarters as well. GenStudio was introduced late in Q4 of last year. That gives you a little bit of a sense that the composition is going to sort of be based on the tenure of these products in the market.\nIf we take a step back and you look at the growth trajectory, again, we're talking $125 million US dollar doubling in the next nine months. It gives you a sense of the scale of these businesses, and really the momentum that's in the business. When you look at it, the core innovation that Shantanu and you talked about led to a lot of utilization. We're starting to get to a point where we can monetize it. For Firefly, we have imaging, vector design, video, voice, video and voice coming out just a couple of weeks ago, off to a good start. I know there have been some questions about how important is commercially safe, the safety of the models.\nThey're very important. A lot of enterprises are turning to them for the quality, the breadth, but also the commercial safety, the creative control that we give them around being able to really match structure, style, set key frames for precise video generation, 3D to image, image to video. The inclusion also on a roadmap, and we'll share more about this next week, of third-party models really establishes us as the one-stop shop for anything you need to do with creativity.\nWhen you ladder that into a Firefly standalone offer with multiple tiers with Pro, Standard, Premium, and Pro, when you look at that integrated into Creative Cloud, you could imagine further tiering there.\nWhen you look at the work that we're doing in conjunction with Anil's team around GenStudio and making sure all of these models and this entire platform, including third-party models, are exposed within our GenStudio offer, what it's really doing is it's evolving away from the conversation being about the model to the conversation being about the workflows, the integration, the application tier, and the agent-based things that we'll be talking to you more about. That really plays to our differentiation, our strength, and our audiences that we serve. That's why you see the bullishness of that $125 million US dollar doubling in the next nine months. Yeah. Next week.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nI'm glad that you find the sort of information useful. I'll give you a little bit more color as well on that. I remember with Acrobat, we have AI Assistant that's separate. This is only the separate Acrobat AI Assistant. The majority of that revenue is actually creative because as we can continue to put the AI Assistant as part of an Acrobat SKU, we would not count that if that came as part of an Acrobat Premium SKU. Color-wise, so far, creative actually represents the majority of that. As you know, the Acrobat business is doing great.\n\nAleksandr Zukin\n\nManaging Director Software Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's very helpful. I guess maybe just to follow along there, you've seen or we've seen a lot of consolidation start to happen within the AI realm with the model companies or the agent, even emerging the agent companies. Maybe just remind us on how you're thinking about your approach towards organic versus inorganic innovation here, given just the plethora of functionality that you're releasing across the board.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nAs it relates to the core creative models, we will have our commercially safe, as David said, Alex. Within Firefly as an application and within each of our product integrations and Photoshop, etc., expect Firefly. We've also signaled and we've shown how we would support third-party models associated with that. Whether it's a custom model that we create for one of our enterprise customers, I think if you look at it, there have been a couple of articles this week about how whether it's Estee Lauder, who's going to be building their models built on ours and leveraging it, or a company like Publicis that's going to be taking these models.\nOur core imaging video franchise will have our models as it relates to text. We have support for other third-party models. I think it's very practical, and it's the right one. We'll support all of the creative third-party models that people want to support, whether it's a custom model we create for them or whether it's any other third-party model within Firefly as an app and within Photoshop, you're going to see support for that as well.\nThink of it as we are the way in which those models actually deliver value to a user. It's actually just like we did with Photoshop plugins in the past. You're going to see those models supported within our flagship applications. Hopefully, that gives you a sense.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nManaging Director Software Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much. I was wondering if you can just comment on what you're sensing fundamentally in terms of advertising activity and consumer spending trends in the wake of some very choppy results from multiple airlines the last several days, and multiple retailers. What is giving you the resilience to reaffirm the FY 2025 guidance when some of those are really huge sectors of the economy, and they seem to be encountering some turbulence? I'm just wondering if you basically see them continuing to create and market and advertise despite this environment.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nI think at the end of the day, Mark, we just believe that digital is going to continue to be a fundamental part of the economy, and the importance is going to continue. I mean, there isn't a single company that I've talked to that doesn't say digital. To your point, as other companies view macroeconomic conditions that may be particular to them, onus is on every company that's serving them with technology to demonstrate how the technology helps, whether it's the top line or the efficiency. Whether it's top line growth, efficiency, or both, they're not going to go out of style as it relates to any enterprise saying, how can I use technology to accomplish my objectives?\n\nMark Murphy\n\nManaging Director Software Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I appreciate that, Shantanu. As a very quick follow-up on Alex's question, with the ARR, the $125 million US dollar ARR doubling in the next nine months, do you think it's going to be the same composition, or is something going to be coming in from the video models that might change the mix there in the next nine months?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThe video model is part of the creative Firefly app that will be part of this. I think a lot of these are great questions, Mark. I mean, at the FA meeting, we'll try and give more color as well as to what we are seeing. We wanted to at least start to outline what products were in there, the growth rates that we expect, and how we're executing on, as I said, the innovation, usage, understanding, and offering these as monetization. We'll also, I know, keep a track of the ongoing questions and address them at the FA meeting as well, Mark.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here and squeezing me in. I'll keep it to one. David, maybe for you, it's great to see the Firefly app tiers that customers can add to their existing subscriptions. Maybe to Shantanu's point, this is a better topic for FA Day, but I'm wondering if we could just talk about how do you envision sort of the potential attach rate there? I mean, Firefly is clearly an unprecedented offering, so maybe that's really tough to answer. Are there any products that maybe Adobe has seen in the past, like Adobe Stock or any others, that you look at as sort of a framework for what that adoption curve could look like?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. If we take a look, if we take a step back, the reason we're so excited about the Firefly app is really twofold. One is exactly where you're going, Saket, and what you're asking about, which is with every conversation we've had with creative professionals, we know that wherever they are, they're under an enormous amount of pressure to produce more. This cohort of creative professionals, we see very strong attach and adoption of the generative AI features we put in the product, partially because they're well integrated and very discoverable, and because they just work and people get a lot of value out of that.\nWhat you will see is you'll start to see us integrating these new capabilities, these premium capabilities that are in the Firefly Standard Pro and Premium plans, more deeply into the creative workflow, so more people have the opportunity to discover them. Of course, as part of that, I think you can expect to see what we've done all along is look at where the usage is, look at where the excitement is, and make sure we get the pricing and the tiering right in a way that maximizes the opportunity for our customers, and maximizes the opportunity and the value that Adobe and our shareholders get as part of that too.\nThat will be a big area and big opportunity. We see a lot of potential there as we look ahead. The other part that I want to make sure doesn't get lost in this is how relevant this Firefly experience is for non-creative professionals as well, this next generation of creators that we keep talking about. If we look at the early adoption rates of the Firefly paid plan, it really tells us both of these stories. We have a high degree of conviction that it's adding value and being used by creative professionals, but it's also proving to be a good onboarding opportunity for next generation pros and creators in general.\nThat's where, Shantanu, you mentioned earlier, there is an increasing opportunity to merge our web and mobile offerings around not just the generative capabilities, but what you do with the content you generate with Photoshop, web and mobile, Express, web and mobile, and you can imagine other capabilities coming around video as well. We're excited Firefly Services and the monetization capabilities there in both directions, new users, and also value in our pool for our existing base.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nSaket, since that was the last question, thank you. Maybe just in a quick summary, I mean, the four things that I would leave you all with is Q1 was a strong start. We were pleased with our performance. When you think about the addressable markets that we have as we think about how we serve the business professional, the consumer, the creative professional, and the marketing professional, we believe that that's an immense opportunity that's only going to grow as a result of AI.\nWe're pleased with how AI is now infused across all of our products and how we are further tailoring the breadth of our products to serve these customer groups in a way in which we delight them. We're starting to outline how the monetization will be different for each one of these, and applicable for the customer group that we are serving. We really continue to believe that this will drive growth and profitability for us as a company in 2025 and beyond. We look forward to joining you all at the FA meeting, and thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have an excellent day."

I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $5.61 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. In our digital media business, we delivered record net new ARR of $578 million, and our Digital Experience business achieved subscription revenue of $1.27 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. 2024 was a year of records for Adobe. We achieved record revenue of $21.51 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share was $12.36, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $18.42, representing 5% and 15% year-over-year growth, respectively. We hit several new milestones with our AI innovations, enabling us to add more than $2 billion in digital media net new ARR and surpass $1 billion in the ending book of business for Adobe Experience Platform and native apps.\nThe Digital Experience business crossed $5 billion in revenue, making us one of the mission-critical providers of marketing technology in the world. We exited the year with $19.96 billion in RPO, and cash and short-term investments of $7.89 billion. 2024 was also a transformative year of product innovation, where we delivered foundational technology platforms. We introduced multiple generative AI models in the Adobe Firefly family, including imaging, vector design, and most recently, video. Adobe now has a comprehensive set of generative AI models designed to be commercially safe for creative content, offering unprecedented levels of output quality and user control in our applications. We reimagined creativity and productivity for a broader set of customers with Adobe Express, the quick and easy create anything app. The deep integration of Firefly across our flagship applications in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud is driving record customer adoption and usage.\nFirefly-powered generations across our tools surpassed $16 billion, with every month this past quarter setting a new record. We enhanced document productivity with AI Assistant in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, unlocking even greater value from the trillions of PDFs around the world. We've successfully scaled Adobe Experience Platform and native apps to deliver the fundamental infrastructure required for customer engagement. We're accelerating automated decisioning and powering audiences, journeys, and channels to deliver truly personalized experiences at scale. We set the stage to drive an AI content revolution by bringing content and data together in Adobe GenStudio, integrating high-velocity creative expression with enterprise activation. The release of Adobe GenStudio for performance marketing integrates Creative Cloud, Express, and Experience Cloud, and extends our end-to-end content supply chain solution, empowering freelancers, agencies, and enterprises to accelerate the delivery of content, advertising, and marketing campaigns.\nI'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q4, we achieved net new digital media ARR of $578 million and revenue of $4.15 billion, which grew 12% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our creative and document businesses. We ended the year with just over $2 billion of net new digital media ARR for the first time ever, as a result of accelerated product innovation, record traffic to adobe.com, and engagement on social and mobile, as well as increasing value for enterprise customers through Firefly services in GenStudio, which bring together our creative and experience clouds. On the Document Cloud side, PDF continues to be the global standard for digital documents, and Adobe Acrobat is revolutionizing the way people engage with them across mobile, web, and desktop. We took a major step forward in FY2024 with the introduction of AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader.\nAI Assistant and other AI features like Liquid Mode and Firefly are accelerating productivity through faster insights, smarter document editing, and integrated image generation. A recent productivity study found that users leveraging AI Assistant completed their document-related tasks four times faster on average. AI Assistant is now available in Acrobat across desktop, web, and mobile, and integrated into our Edge, Chrome, and Microsoft Teams extensions. In Q4, we continue to extend its value with specialized AI for contracts and scanned documents, support for additional languages, and the ability to analyze larger documents. In Acrobat Web, our integrations with Adobe Express allow users to generate images and quickly stylize content. We saw AI Assistant conversations double quarter over quarter, driving deeper customer value. In Q4, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $843 million, growing 17% year-over-year.\nWe set a record for net new Document Cloud ARR of $173 million, with ending ARR of $3.48 billion, growing 23% year-over-year. Other highlights include continued growth of monthly active users, which grew over 25% year-over-year, surpassing 650 million paid and free users. Strong top-of-funnel momentum through Acrobat Web, with monthly active users up nearly 50% year-over-year. Strength in Acrobat Pro single app in both Document Cloud and Creative Cloud offerings. A great back-to-school season with a new AI Assistant offering in education for students. Key enterprise customer wins include Abbott Laboratories, BWI GmbH, Defense Information Systems Agency, Kaiser Permanente, Novo Nordisk, Truist, UScellular, and the U.S. Department of State. Creative Cloud also had a strong year, as demand for content continues to grow across mobile, desktop, and streaming platforms.\nAdobe MAX, the premier creativity conference, showcased our FY2024 innovation and drove over half a billion video views across all channels. We have made major strides with our generative AI models, with the introduction of Firefly Image Model 3, enhancements to our vector models, Firefly Design models, and the all-new Firefly Video model. These models are incredibly powerful on their own, and their deep integration into our tools like Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere, InDesign, and Express have brought incredible value to millions of creative professionals around the world. We have brought our creative and experience clouds together through the introduction of Firefly Services in GenStudio, addressing the growing need for scaled content production in enterprises. Firefly generations continue to accelerate and have now crossed 16 billion cumulative generations. In Q4, we achieved $3.3 billion in revenue, which grew 11% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $405 million.\nOther highlights include adoption of Adobe Express by approximately 4,000 businesses in the quarter, and an 84% year-over-year increase in the number of students with access to Express Premium as part of this year's back-to-school season. Adobe Express saw strong ecosystem growth, with over 180 plugins available in the Express Marketplace, and integrations with leading social, productivity, and collaboration apps like ChatGPT, Google, Slack, Wix, Box, HubSpot, and Webflow, significantly increasing our customer reach. The launch of the Firefly video model and its unique integration in Premiere Pro in limited public beta garnered massive customer interest. We look forward to making it more broadly available in early 2025. This feature drove a 70% increase in the number of Premiere Pro beta users since it was introduced at MAX.\nEnhancements to Firefly Image, Vector, and Design models include four times faster image generation, and new capabilities integrated into Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Adobe Express. Strong adoption of Lightroom Mobile with customers embracing innovations like generative remove and lens blur, as well as quick actions, which streamlines editing and increases discovery and adoption of premium features. Just this morning, Adobe Lightroom was recognized as the Mac App of the Year in Apple's annual App Store Awards. The launch of the new Frame.io v4 streamlines creative management for video projects to enable end-to-end editing capabilities and seamless collaboration between editors and their stakeholders. Firefly services adoption continued to ramp as enterprises such as Pepsi and Tapestry use it to scale content production, given the robust APIs and ease of creating custom models that are designed to be commercially safe.\nKey enterprise customer wins include Alphabet, American Express, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, LVMH, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, T-Mobile, and the U.S. Department of Defense. Our AI product releases and business evolution in FY2024 have set the stage for another strong year ahead as we expand to new audiences, deliver more value to existing users, and increasingly integrate our digital media and Digital Experience clouds to create differentiated business solutions. We will do this by accelerating the adoption of freemium offers, including Express, Lightroom, and Acrobat on web and mobile, as well as expanding access to Acrobat AI Assistant, which delivered strong financial performance in FY2024. Growing our core creative business by continuing to expand our AI innovations in our flagship applications, as well as bringing them to web and mobile.\nIn addition, we will soon introduce a new higher-priced Firefly offering that includes our video models as a comprehensive AI solution for creative professionals. This will allow us to monetize new users, provide additional value to existing customers, and increase ARPU. Further accelerating Firefly services, which saw significant demand in FY2024, by integrating it into GenStudio to provide enterprises with solutions to exponentially scale their content production capabilities with AI. We're thrilled with the response to our innovations in FY2024, excited to release new capabilities, and look forward to delighting customers in the year ahead. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone.

We are confident of continuing our leadership and momentum into 2025. I will now pass it to Dan.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and FY2024 results, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. We are proud of the performance we have driven in FY2024, delivering record revenue, EPS, and operating cash flows, while aggressively investing in AI product innovation. New AI releases, including Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly Services, DX Premium tiers, and GenStudio for performance marketing, have expanded the portfolio of products, driving proliferation and meaningful Gen AI monetization.

Q4 business and financial highlights included digital media revenue of $4.15 billion, net new digital media ARR of $578 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.40 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.92 billion, and added $1.82 billion to RPO in the quarter.\nIn our digital media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $4.15 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $17.33 billion of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 13% year-over-year in constant currency. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $843 million, which represents 17% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. In the quarter, we added $173 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 23% year-over-year in constant currency. Fourth quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included strong growth across Reader and Acrobat on web and mobile, and extensions such as Edge and Chrome. Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments, routes to market, and geographies.\nAccelerated adoption and monetization of AI Assistant driven by product enhancements, delivery of French and German language support, and year-end seasonal strength in the enterprise. We achieved creative revenue of $3.30 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 11% in constant currency. In the quarter, we added $405 million of net new creative ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 11% year-over-year in constant currency. Fourth quarter Creative Cloud growth drivers included strong demand for new subscriptions for Creative Cloud All Apps across individuals, teams, enterprise, and education, strength in Creative Cloud single apps for Acrobat Pro, Lightroom, and Photoshop, momentum with new subscriptions in emerging markets, demand for Adobe Express across education, SMB, and enterprises, and adoption of Firefly Services in the enterprise.\nTurning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q4, we achieved revenue of $1.40 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital experience subscription revenue was $1.27 billion, growing 13% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Fourth quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included a strong finish to the year with the largest-ever bookings quarter, and robust performance across geographies, including the US and EMEA, and multiple verticals, including financial services. Strong subscription revenue growth was led by Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Journey Optimizer, real-time customer data platform, Customer Journey Analytics, and Workfront. Continued strength in retention and expansion across our enterprise customers, with Digital Experience solutions being leveraged by 85 of the Fortune 100 companies. Momentum with AEP and native apps, with FY2024 ending book of business surpassing $1.00 billion and growing greater than 40% year-over-year.\nStrong bookings for our umbrella GenStudio solution, with interest and momentum for our new GenStudio for performance marketing offering. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 15.5% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. RPO exiting the quarter was $19.96 billion, growing 16%, and CRPO growing 13% year-over-year as reported. Our cash flows from operations in the quarter were a record $2.92 billion, and ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $7.89 billion. In Q4, we entered into a $2.5 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $17.65 billion remaining of our $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024. Now turning to our FY2025 financial targets, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ending ARR at year-end.\nFX rate changes between the end of FY2023 and the end of FY2024 have resulted in a $117 million decrease to the digital media ARR balance entering FY2025, from $17.33 to 17.22 billion, and is reflected on our investor data sheet. We expect an approximate $200 million headwind to FY2025 revenue as a result of the effect of foreign exchange and a smaller impact of the continued move to subscriptions from perpetual offerings. Factored into our financial targets is an ongoing strategy to introduce new tiered subscription offerings, and add-ons. For FY2025, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $23.30 to 23.55 billion, digital media segment revenue of $17.25 billion to 17.40 billion, digital media ending ARR book of business growth of 11.0% year-over-year, Digital Experience segment revenue of $5.80 to 5.90 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $5.375 to 5.425 billion.\nGAAP earnings per share are $15.80 to $16.10, and non-GAAP earnings per share are $20.20 to 20.50. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 46% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%. For Q1, fiscal 2025, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.63 to 5.68 billion, digital media segment revenue of $4.17 to $4.20 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.38 to 1.40 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.27 to 1.29 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to 3.90, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.95 to 5. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 47% and non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%. In summary, I'm proud of our outstanding performance, which combines robust product leadership, velocity of innovation, and financial discipline, positioning us to achieve strong revenue and EPS growth in the year ahead. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan.

Adobe continues to build on its strong foundation of transformative innovation, category and brand leadership, financial performance, and profitable growth.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nWe're delivering Adobe magic to an expanding set of global customers and executing on the massive market opportunity ahead. Adobe couldn't be better positioned for 2025 and beyond. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star one if you would like to signal with questions. The first question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash, if you could press star one on your touch-tone telephone. Again, star one on your touch-tone telephone. We'll go next to Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a few things focusing on expanding innovations, including newer, higher-priced Firefly offerings and potentially accelerating Firefly by integrating further into GenStudio. I was hoping you could just maybe expand on how you're thinking about the adoption curves of those efforts. As a second part, Dan, if you can just add any commentary on how you're incorporating some of these newer efforts into forecasts, if there's conservatism just given they're newer or just how to think about that, also useful. Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nSure. Yeah, I'll go ahead and get started. AI obviously has been a huge area of focus for us, and frankly, our community has been using it at amazing rates. We're very excited you heard the $16 billion—sorry, not dollars—16 billion generations that we talked about in the prepared remarks. That's really a function of the investments we've made in creating the broadest set of models. We've talked about imaging, vector, design in the past. We now have video and audio in beta form as well. The foundational difference between what we do and what everyone else does in the market really comes down to three things. One is commercially safe, the way we train the models. Two is the incredible control we bake into the models.\nThree is the integration that we make with these models into our products, increasingly, of course, in our CC flagship applications, but also in Express and Lightroom and these kinds of applications, but also in Anil's DX products as well. That set of things is a critical part of the foundation and a durable differentiator for us as we go forward. Now, as we introduce the video model, which we expect to have in market early next year, that's going to create an opportunity to further tier our Creative Cloud offerings. As you, I'm sure, understand, video generation is a much higher value activity than image generation, and as a result, it gives us the ability to start to tier Creative Cloud more actively there. In addition to that, this year, we introduced Firefly Services. That's off to a great start.\nWe have a lot of customers that are using that. A couple we talked about on the call include Tapestry. They're using it for scaled content production. Pepsi, for their Gatorade brand, is enabling their customers to personalize any merchandise that they're buying, in particular, starting with Gatorade bottles. These have been very, very productive for them. We are seeing this leveraged by a host of other companies for everything from localization at scale, to personalization at scale, to user engagement, or just raw content production at scale as well. Last, not to get missed in all of this, is everything we're doing with AI Assistant. AI Assistant for Acrobat is off to an incredibly strong start, and we see it continuing to accelerate. All of this has built a great foundation for us in FY2024.\nIt's given us a lot of signal from our customer base, and we've learned a lot that we intend to apply as we optimize the value and the tiering for our customers going forward.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, just building on David's comments as it relates to the FY2025 guide, we talk about all of the great innovation that's in flight. I would say the velocity of innovation is greater today than it's ever been. We called out products like Express, AI Assistant, Firefly, premium tiers in DX, GenStudio. The good thing is they're meaningful contributors today to the financial performance, and extrapolating the momentum that we see in those products, taking a point of view on the future pipeline of innovation, how we bring that to life, deeply natively integrated into our products, and further extend the value we offer to customers, as well as the additional segments we can access. All of this comes together to take a perspective of what 2025 looks like based on the strong start that we have and the meaningful contribution in FY2024.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe to the point that you just alluded to in terms of AI being meaningful as part of the broader growth narrative for business, can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about the growth driver from Firefly, from GenStudio, and kind of how will we see that percolate through the year in terms of the net new digital media ARR? Is that something that you think is more going to be showing up in the DX business? It'd be great to get some color there. Anything, Dan, that we should think through given the new guidance methodology around seasonality or linearity for net new ARR in the digital media business?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nSure. I'm happy to take that in. First of all, yeah, as we mentioned, we're really excited about the FY2024 momentum that we're seeing, that we're carrying into it. We've had this conversation in the past around how we think about the growth algorithm for the digital media business. Maybe let me reiterate a little bit of that. We've talked about this in the context of P times Q plus V in the past, where P is new users bringing in more people into the franchise. We're continuing to do that, obviously, with the introduction of Express.\nWe're seeing a lot of great growth there, whether it's through our phones channel reaching out to SMB, whether it's corporate reaching out to the mid-market, or whether it's working more closely with Anil and the DX business, and the integrations we have between Express and the DX business reaching into large companies. We're doing a lot in terms of proliferation of Express into education. We've done a number of partnerships that we talked about with Box, ChatGPT, HubSpot, and others, but also our own products like Acrobat workflows from Acrobat and Reader into Express. Really pushing to drive more new customers into the franchise, in addition to the continued growth that we're getting in our core creative products.\nSecond, in terms of the core creative products, this is where the Q—the, sorry, I said it backwards—the price actually increases with core value because when we're introducing Firefly models into the mix, we get the opportunity to integrate them more into the flagship applications. As I mentioned earlier, with the Firefly web application, we have the opportunity to create more tiers across the creative products so that we can get people in the right plan for their needs. We're very bullish about video, and the breadth of our customer base that are going to need access to these video models. Again, remember, they're integrated deeply into our applications, including Premiere. We're very excited about what that could mean for us.\nLastly, the business value for customers in enterprise or corporate, that's where the value-based selling that we do along with the Digital Experience business really plays out. Firefly Services, as I mentioned, with Gatorade, Tapestry, and a whole host of others that have come, everyone in the space is driving towards personalization of that content, and they absolutely need a scaled production and automation pipeline to generate more content. That's what Firefly Services does. As it has hit this level of escape velocity, we're now integrating it more into the DX products, in particular, GenStudio, so that it becomes a more holistic solution as we go into FY2025 and accelerate that. Alex, that's what's leading to the guide of 11%. If you really take a step back, that's one of the best guides we've given in terms of next-year ARR growth.\nOne thing maybe to keep in mind is the composition of that growth is going to be a little different next year compared to FY2024. Again, the growth algorithm is new users, new products, and value and pricing. New users and new products will be a more significant part of the mix as we go into FY2025. We're looking forward to sort of that foundational base of the business growing and driving the business.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nTo build on that, Alex, I appreciate the question around the shape of FY2025. Here's what I'll share about it. We all know we changed the guidance methodology into 2025. The guide around the ending ARR book of business growth, we just have a strong point of view. It's a better indicator of business health trajectory. David talked about the growth algorithm, the growth agenda at the company. New subscribers are the predominant driver of growth, has been, continues to be. The second leg, cross-sell, upsell. This is something the company has honed a really great skill at over time. Once we bring people into the Adobe ecosystem to journey them through the rich set of technologies and products that we have to bring them deeper into the ecosystem, that's an important element. Lastly, David mentioned pricing.\nThis is about how we segment the product portfolio, the value that we deliver to our customers. As we think about the innovation, as we think about the growth algorithm, and as we think about increasingly monetizing the rich set of innovation that we've already brought to market, as well as in the pipeline to be brought to market, quarterly profile, we view it as less important. Really want to focus on revenue and EPS, focus on the annual book of business growth. We think that's the most important way to look at the business, and it's also how we, as the management team, run the business.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much. David, I just wonder if I could just follow up on your last comment on sort of, obviously, driving new users, new adoptions, incredibly important. Is there pricing sensitivity, meaning you're delivering so much value? I'd think that pricing, given the value you're delivering, would be a bigger lever unless there's pricing sensitivity. Can you just walk through that a little bit more? It feels like you should be able to get sort of all three vectors going at the same time, whereas I know you're going to focus more on bringing people in and making them successful. I'm sort of—I guess is there something else on the pricing side that I'm missing? Why you're not getting that as well? Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. We've talked about this in the context of proliferation versus short-term monetization and how we have to balance both of those. That's something that we take very seriously, and we look at that. If you look at the lower end of the market, as we have entered with Express, Lightroom, and Acrobat. By the way, the web and mobile motion for us has been productive in bringing in a lot more new users, so you'll expect to see us do more of that and introduce more products in that segment in FY2025 as well. There is certainly price sensitivity at that side of the market when it comes to both premium users and also converted to paid users. We'll continue to enable that.\nWhen it comes to the core business, and this is the business of creative professionals, we are very focused on introducing new value that is going to create more segmentation, more tiering, and align value and pricing to what we are delivering there. We do see a tremendous amount of opportunity there going forward because the value that we bring and the efficiency we bring to the content creation process there is very significant. Last, and certainly not least, as we talked about in core enterprises, that's where we've been able to sort of cross that chasm from a P times Q business over to a value sale business. We are able to start to get more automation and workflows in place there as well. It's a mix of these things. We are going to continue to balance.\nWe are obviously tracking, and we believe that proliferation, as we've said for some time, is one of the top priorities because we know that if people start using our products today, we have the opportunity to continue to deliver value for a long time to come. That balance is what we try to do. It's a management judgment call, but we think we're getting it right.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nAgain, that's a quick follow-up for Dan. Dan, obviously, Black Monday fell into your first quarter this current year. Any color you can offer in terms of what that meant, if at all, to Creative Cloud net new ARR this quarter?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Black Friday, Cyber Monday played out about as expected. We've been talking about a multi-year trend where commercial activity is shifting left in terms of timing. We run our promotions over a larger window of time to reflect consumer behavior. We see a similar pattern commercially from our customers this year that we've seen in prior years. If we think about online shopping this year, up 8.4%. You can see last year that's up from 4.8%. A nice step up this year versus last year. You can see Cyber Monday from a contribution standpoint. Even though the growth last year was down relative to this year, Cyber Monday grew at 9.6% this year at 7.3%. Just illustrates the flattening of the profile and consumer behavior around that. Performance as expected.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. A lot of excitement from you guys on the conference call about the pace of innovation going on in the business. We hear that excitement from creative professionals, and they talk about an acceleration in the pace of innovation. Apologies to state the obvious, but investors aren't feeling that excitement or aren't showing that excitement. The stock is a major underperformer on a year-to-date basis. It's found, again, on an after-hours basis today. I would point to the lack of acceleration that we're seeing in their numbers, right? Digital media net new ARR this quarter grew just, or in Creative Cloud grew 2%. You're guiding to decelerating growth into the forward year despite all this innovation. I think the question that it brings up in investors' minds is, is there some leak in the bucket, right?\nAll this innovation, new monetization avenues, pricing going up, the growth is going in the wrong direction. Is there a part of the equation that's not working? Is there share losses? Is there something that we're not seeing that is taking away that momentum in the numbers? That's why we're not seeing the acceleration in the numbers, if you will.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nWell, Keith, maybe I'll talk about that. I mean, if you take a step back and think about the year, I'll certainly address the feedback that you're sh aring. From our perspective, when we guided at the beginning of the year, when we re-guided then in the middle of the year to $19.50, and when we guided in Q3, the reality is we beat all those three targets that we had issued: beginning of the year, middle of the year, and end of the year. I think specifically maybe as it relates to the Q4 digital media net new ARR and thinking about it from the creative, the one thing that I'll point out there is that actually creative did better than probably is evident in that if you think about the contribution of Acrobat that went into the creative bucket versus the Document Cloud business.\nCertainly, Acrobat continues to do well, record, as you saw. The non-Acrobat contribution in creative actually had more growth than what you would see if you just look at it from a Creative Cloud ARR. I think to your bigger question about what's happening in the business, and as we think about it at the scale of the business right now, certainly, as this entire world moves towards generative AI, as David said, we're executing on both the proliferation play at the bottom with Express and Acrobat, and at the high end with the Creative Pro and with the enterprise, we are seeing significant adoption of that. I think GenStudio will also be a good unlock because GenStudio actually brings this all together in the enterprise in a way that nobody else can.\nWhen we think about Firefly Services, you think about the custom models, you think about the ability to move all of that into campaigns at pace, we are seeing significant traction in that particular space. The business is going through a change as it relates to the lower end. For the core creative, as well as for the enterprise, it's actually headed absolutely in line with our expectations, with good acceleration. On the consumer communicator space, I think the traction that we're seeing with Express on proliferation also gives us a lot of optimism for how that part of the business is also doing well. We take our targets seriously. It's the beginning of the year. We want to go keep executing and innovating on it.\nTo the point that I think you, as well as others, have asked, is there opportunity in the growth agenda, not just to think about the innovation and the offerings, but to make sure that as we tier these, that the pricing and the value is appropriate? Absolutely. I think you'll continue to see us. I think David mentioned that in his prepared remarks, as well as Dan did, that you'll see us also have new tiered offerings that reflect that value that we're providing to the Creative Pro, as well as to the business segments.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you for the feedback.\n\nOperator\n\nMoving on to Keith Bachman with BMO.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask David to you if I could on Doc Cloud specifically. Growth was certainly strong this quarter. I just wanted to understand some of the context associated with durability. If you could break it into some of the parts, it looks like your monthly active users continues to grow well. In addition to that, how are you thinking about leveraging the value there in terms of price, specifically within the growth of Doc Cloud? The broader question is just on the durability of Doc Cloud's glue of 23% over the course of the quarter in terms of ARR, trying to understand how durable it is and what the pieces are. I have a follow-up.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. I think Document Cloud has been, if you think about the fact that we're 40 years into this business, it's really just the foundation. The fact that PDF has become the de facto standard for unstructured data in the world, and Adobe and Acrobat are the most trusted providers of solutions for that. That's really what is the foundation of what is driving the business, including the fact that it's the most secure platform for leveraging and accessing the content. I think there are two things that are really the growth drivers of this business. There are a number of things. First is exactly like you said. I mean, monthly active users and free and paid is a key stat that we keep looking at. We are very effective at taking free users of Reader and converting them to paid users of Acrobat.\nWe continue to do that across more surfaces. It used to be predominantly a focus on desktop applications. As we've noted in the past, we now have Edge integrations and Chrome integrations. We're also available in Teams, and we're also available on mobile devices for iOS and Android. The mix of all those continues to grow on a monthly basis. One of the things that we are doing to drive that growth is helping people see the value of sharing a link to the PDF as opposed to sharing the document itself. In doing so, you get a lot more control in terms of the conversation, feedback, and review around that.\nIt also drives the fact that the recipient is then guaranteed to be viewing the PDF in an Adobe surface that we can then use to close that viral loop and drive further top-of-funnel opportunity to convert. That foundation is very strong. In addition to that, AI Assistant has been really a phenomenal add. Unlike many other players in the space, we don't require significant security and governance reviews because people can have conversations around the documents that they view. One of the big things that I think has been unlocked this year is moving not just by looking at a PDF that you happen to be viewing, but being able to look at and have a conversation with multiple documents, some of which don't even have to be PDF.\nThat transition gives us the ability to really take Acrobat and make it more of a general-purpose productivity platform. That's really what drove the adoption that we saw in education this year. That's another way of saying that the core foundation of Acrobat continues to be strong and is actually getting stronger with MOU increasing. The new value we're adding with AI Assistant takes Acrobat to an entire new level in terms of value.\nMaybe the thing I'll add to that is the durability of that, to your point, in languages, as we roll that out in languages, as we roll it out across multiple documents, and as we roll it out in enterprises and B2B specifically. Again, significant headroom in terms of the innovation agenda of how Acrobat can be made even more meaningful as a knowledge tool within the enterprise.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nOkay. It sort of leads into my follow-up question, if I could sneak it in, is we've talked about during the course of this call tonight the various drivers of growth for ARR. I just wanted to specifically ask about consumption as we think about FY2025. The question is, is that going to be a contributor towards ARR growth, or should investors really be thinking about trying to maximize seats, if you will, and really shouldn't it be about consumption being additive to growth in 2025? That's it for me. Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nI think, Keith, you're going to see a quote-unquote consumption add to ARR in two or maybe three ways, more so in 2025 than in 2024. The first, and David alluded to this, is if you have a video offering, and that video offering, that will be a pure consumption pricing associated with it. I think the second is in GenStudio, and for enterprises and what they are seeing with respect to Firefly Services, which, again, I think David touched on how much momentum we're seeing in that business. That is, in effect, a consumption business as it relates to the enterprise. I think that will also continue to increase. I think you'll see us with perhaps more premium price offering.\nThe intention is that consumption is what's driving the increased ARR, but it may be as a result of a tier in the pricing rather than a consumption model where people actually have to monitor it. It's just another way, much like AI Assistant is, of monetizing it, but it's not like we're going to be tracking every single generation for the user. It'll just be at a different tier. We think that that's both a better way to deliver value, as well as to get the monetization.\n\nOperator\n\nMoving on to Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nOh, wonderful. Thank you. I'm going to ask a question, David, of you, please. In the past, you've provided some good color. It sounds like there's momentum there. It seems like this would be the year with all the Firefly Services integration into the core franchises that we could see some acceleration and conversion of that funnel. We'd love to get some updates from you on that effort and how you see that unfolding throughout the year. Thank you.",
    "content2": "David Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nFor a second, you actually cut out. You said Firefly. We heard that. Did you mention any other product before we answer that question, Brad, just to make sure we capture your question?\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nReally just Firefly Services across all the franchises, Photoshop, Lightroom, etc. What could that integration effort do to the conversion activity with the top-of-funnel?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. A number of things. First of all, you're exactly right in terms of Firefly as a platform and a foundation that we're leveraging across many different products. As we talked about, everything from Express and Lightroom and even in Acrobat on mobile for broad base, but also in our core creative products, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere. As we've alluded to a number of times on this call with the introduction of video, even a standalone offer for Firefly that we think will be more valuable from a tiering perspective there. Into Firefly Services through APIs and connection to GenStudio, we are looking at leveraging the power of this AI foundation in all the activities. Now, as it relates to top-of-funnel and conversion, we're very excited. Let's start with new users and more closer to the low end of the market.\nWe're very excited with the signal we're getting from Express and Lightroom on mobile and web. Again, as we talked about, Express is seeing some really good new user acquisition. We added 4,000 new businesses this year. We increased education access by 84% this back-to-school versus last back-to-school. We're seeing really strong adoption through social, digital, and mobile traffic as well. We see that when we invest in mobile and web, we are getting some very positive signals in terms of user adoption and user conversion rate. We're using Firefly very actively to do that. By the way, the fact that Firefly continues to be the only commercially safe model integrated into these apps does matter when it comes to, as I said, adding 4,000 new businesses.\nThe second thing is we are seeing in the core creative business when people try something like Photoshop, the onboarding experience is faster to success because of the use of generative AI and generative capabilities. You'll start to see us continuing to drive more proliferation of those capabilities earlier in the user journeys, and that has been proven very productive. We also noticed that more people use generative AI. Again, we've always had good retention rates, but the more people use generative AI, the longer they retain as well. We are definitely leveraging generative AI for that entire flow in the funnel.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nAs we pass the top of the hour, we just have time for one more question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Dan, you noted that your current RPO was up 13% in the quarter, which results in a 10% three-year CAGR for current RPO. Would you expect that over time, or at least in fiscal 2025, that your current RPO growth would be closer to what you just reported for Q4, or might revert more to the lower three-year CAGR? For David, if I could, just since there were so many mentions of tiered offerings, is the concept there more around functionality at the product level as compared to the olden days of tiering that was more about segmentation and packaging as in the old CS days, or more currently around the functionality that you're offering on a product-by-product basis?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jay. What I definitely don't want to do is get into guiding of CRPO. When I take a step back and think about the rhythm and flow of the business, what we're seeing on the enterprise side, winning large transformational deals, exiting the year with the largest bookings quarter ever, having premium tiers in that product portfolio, momentum around AEP and apps continuing to grow at scale. When we think about content supply chain and bringing cross-cloud opportunities together that really get at meaningful pain points of customers over time, and then we think about the innovation that we're driving through the digital media business, I feel really good about our ability to continue to drive the business going forward, and I'm very encouraged by what I see.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Just adding on briefly to the question on tiering, yeah, Jay, if you think about what we've done over the last year, there's been a bit of experimentation. Obviously, in the core creative applications, we've done the generative credits model. What we saw with Acrobat was this idea of a separate package and a separate SKU that created a tier that people were able to access the feature through. As we learn from all of these, we think, as Shantanu had mentioned earlier, that the right tiering model for us is going to be a combination of feature, access to certain features, and usage limits on it. The higher the tier, the more features you get, and the more usage you get of it.\nSince that was the last question, let me again, maybe in quick summary, just talk about first, we had a strong 2024, but I think that really sets us up even better for a strong 2025 given the innovation that we've had. I think as it relates to all three businesses that we have, the Creative Cloud with everything that we've done around AI, we have a lot of momentum going into the business, and a really great, diverse portfolio in terms of both the customers as well as our offerings. Acrobat continues to perform really well with AI Assistant as we bring it to other languages, get more vertical use cases for that particular solution, and extend it beyond a single document. We continue to think that the Document Cloud has significant opportunity ahead of us.\nI think bringing that all together with Digital Experience, Q4 was really an extremely strong quarter as it related to us bringing all these solutions together in GenStudio. I think much like we did with AEP and apps and data and have driven that to a billion-dollar business, I feel just the same amount of excitement with what we can do with content and AI and how we can accelerate the creation of that all the way from ideation to the multiple variations that's required. We look forward to sharing more with you at the end of our Q1. In the interim, thank you for joining us, and happy holidays.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThank you. Another interview.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation today."

Adobe had an outstanding quarter, achieving revenue of $5.31 billion, representing 11% year over year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.49, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.48, representing 15% year over year growth. Our success is driven by growing customer value through an innovative product roadmap.\nThe advances we are delivering across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud are enabling us to attract an expanding universe of users. Everyone from creators, communicators, students, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes are using our products to unleash their creativity, accelerate document productivity, and power their digital businesses. Adobe's highly differentiated approach to AI is rooted in the belief that creativity is a uniquely human trait, and that AI has the power to assist and amplify human ingenuity and enhance productivity.\nWe're innovating across data models and interfaces, and natively integrating AI across all our offerings. In Creative Cloud we've invested in training our Firefly family of creative generative AI models with a proprietary data set and delivering AI functionality within our flagship products, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. We're reimagining creativity for a broader set of customers by delivering Adobe Express as an AI-first application across the web and mobile surfaces.\nSince its debut in March 2023, Firefly has been used to generate over 9 billion images across Adobe Creative Tools. In Document Cloud, we're revolutionizing document productivity with Acrobat AI Assistant, an AI-powered conversational engine that can easily be deployed in minutes. This enhances the value of the trillions of PDFs which hold a significant portion of the world's information. Acrobat AI Assistant features are now available through an add-on subscription to all Reader and Acrobat enterprise and individual customers across desktop, web, and mobile.\nAt the end of May, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Adobe Experience Platform, which we conceived and built from scratch and which is on track to be the next billion-dollar business in our digital experience portfolio. We released AEP AI Assistant to enhance the productivity of marketing practitioners through generative AI while expanding access to native AEP applications. With Adobe GenStudio, we're bringing together products across our clouds, including Creative Cloud, Adobe Experience Manager, Workfront, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics, as well as Adobe Express for Business, to address the massive content supply chain opportunity. Our approach to empower marketers to quickly plan, create, manage, activate, and measure on-brand content is resonating with customers and validating our leadership across data, content, and journeys to deliver personalized experiences at scale.\nWe're extending our applications to integrate third party text, image, and video models, and partnering strategically to create multimodal large language models, offering customers greater choice in tools and further enhancing the value of our leading applications and solutions. We're driving strong usage, value, and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments, and seeing early success monetizing new AI technologies across our digital media and digital experience businesses. Given this rich product roadmap, focus on execution, and customer demand in the first half of the year, we're pleased to raise our annual Digital Media Net New ARR, Digital Experience subscription revenue, and EPS targets. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q2, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $487 million and revenue of $3.91 billion, which grew 12% year over year. On the Document Cloud side, PDF has become a global standard for automating business and consumer workflows, and Acrobat is the platform of choice to view, edit, share, and collaborate with these documents.\nWe continue to see steady growth in monthly active users of our Document Cloud solutions, including Acrobat Reader, Acrobat Standard, and Pro, and our signature share and review workflows across mobile, web, and desktop. The introduction of Acrobat AI Assistant, made generally available in April for English documents, marks the beginning of a new era of innovation and efficiency for the approximately 3 trillion PDFs in the world.\nAcrobat AI Assistant is empowering everyone to shift from reading documents to having conversations with them in order to summarize documents, extract insights, compose presentations, and share learnings. AI Assistant is available as a standalone offer for use in Reader and as an add-on to Acrobat Standard and Pro. We're seeing early success driving adoption of AI Assistant as part of our commerce flows and remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities.\nIn Q2, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $782 million, growing 19% year over year. We added $165 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, which was a Q2 record, with year over year ending ARR growth of 24% in constant currency. Other business highlights include general availability of Acrobat AI Assistant, support for document types beyond PDF, meeting transcripts, and enterprise requirements.\nAcrobat Link sharing for PDF-based collaboration continues to grow rapidly, more than doubling year over year and driving viral new user adoption. Free monthly active users of Acrobat web grew over 60% year over year as a result of Link sharing, and our Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome extensions continued strength with free-to-pay digital conversion as a result of product-led growth optimizations. Strong growth in the SMB segment for our Teams offering was driven by a combination of seat expansion and new account wins.\nKey enterprise customer wins with AstraZeneca, Chevron, the state government of Florida, the state of Illinois, UnitedHealthcare Services, and Wells Fargo turning to Creative Cloud. Creative professionals are leading the global charge to meet the ever-increasing demand for engaging content across a variety of platforms and channels. Enterprises rely on creative professionals to produce differentiated content to drive increasingly personalized marketing campaigns.\nSolopreneurs and small businesses need to stand out in a crowded digital landscape with engaging videos and designs. Educators are passionate about providing students with the visual communication skills needed to thrive, and in the decades ahead, consumers are increasingly looking for ways to share their stories digitally. Adobe Express and Firefly Services are uniquely positioned to catalyze this opportunity for everyone by leveraging the promise of generative AI.\nOur Creative Cloud flagship applications continue to release new features that are significantly improving user onboarding, while simultaneously delivering an unprecedented level of power and precision. Generative Fill and Generative Expand are already two of the top three features used by customers on the latest version of Photoshop. Text to Vector support is off to a great start in Illustrator.\nRemove Object is the fastest growing feature in Lightroom Mobile, a preview of generative AI capabilities in Premiere won Production Hub Award of Excellence at NAB, the largest video show in North America. We are integrating our leading applications with Firefly and third party generative AI models to deliver the richest, most engaging content.\nOur vision for Adobe Express is to provide a breakthrough application to make design easy for communicators worldwide, leveraging generative AI and decades of Adobe technology across web and mobile. Our launch of the all new Express application on iOS and Android earlier this quarter is off to a strong start, with monthly active users doubling quarter over quarter. This week's Design Made Easy event, which focused on Express for Business, was another big step forward for us. Companies of all sizes are excited about the integrated power and commercial safety of Firefly.\nThe seamless workflows with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe Experience Cloud, and enterprise-grade brand controls that are now part of Express for Business, make it the optimal product for marketing, sales, and HR teams to quickly and easily create visual content to share. We also announced the general availability of Firefly Services and custom models at Summit. The platform makes API calls and model customization available to developers, accessible through low-code, no-code tools, and integrates with our Experience Cloud products. Firefly Services can power the creation of thousands of asset variations in minutes instead of months, and at a fraction of the cost. This allows us to monetize the volume of content being created through automation services.\nThe increasing availability of Firefly in Creative Cloud, Express, Firefly Services, and the web app is giving us opportunities to access more new users, provide more value to existing users, and monetize content automation. These integrations are driving the acceleration of Firefly generations, with May seeing the most generations of any month to date. In Q2, we achieved $3.13 billion in revenue, which grew 11% year over year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $322 million. Other business highlights include the launch of Express for Business, including support for brand controls and template locking, Firefly custom models, bulk creation and generation of variations, presentation and print capabilities, and workflows with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Experience Cloud.\nThe release of Firefly Image 3 Foundation Model with high-quality image generation and more control with structure and style reference, the release of the Photoshop beta with reference image and advances in Generative Fill, the debut of Generative Remove in Adobe Lightroom enabling anyone to remove unwanted objects from any photograph non-destructively with stunning, high-quality, photorealistic results. The release of the Premiere beta with new audio workflows driving strong usage, the deep integration of Firefly in Substance 3D, which provides an easy way to create textures and materials from reference images. The introduction of an all-new Frame IO streamlining workflows across content types on a flexible and intuitive collaboration platform.\nKey enterprise customer wins include Crèdit Agricole, FedEx, Infosys, Rakuten, Ralph Lauren, Samsung, Schneider Electric, and Volvo. We're excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the digital media business, and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services, and Express. We're pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion, and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. In Q2, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $1.33 billion. Subscription revenue was $1.2 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. We are the industry leader in helping enterprises deliver personalized experiences at scale to their customers by combining the right content, customer data, and journeys in real time. When we introduced Adobe Experience Platform five years ago, it was a revolutionary approach to address customer data and journeys.\nToday, we're the number one digital experience platform, and AEP with native apps is well on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business. We're now transforming the content supply chain for enterprises with Adobe GenStudio, enabling them to produce content at scale, leveraging generative AI through native integrations with Firefly Services and Adobe Express for business.\nEnterprise customers both B2C and B2B view customer experience management and personalization at scale as key areas of differentiation, making it a priority investment for Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Information Officers, and Chief Digital Officers. We're excited by the customer interest and adoption of our latest innovations, including AEP AI Assistant, a generative AI powered conversational interface that empowers practitioners to automate tasks, simulate outcomes, and generate new audiences and journeys.\nFor example, customers like General Motors and HanesBrands have been working with AEP AI Assistant to boost productivity and accelerate time to value while democratizing access to AEP and apps across their organizations. Marriott International is a great example of a customer that's expanded its decade-long relationship with Adobe and turned to Adobe Experience Cloud to orchestrate highly personalized guest experiences across online reservations and the Marriott Bonvoy mobile app.\nAdobe Real Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer enable Marriott to connect data from disparate sources and activate relevant experiences in moments that matter, helping the company match individuals with the best options across its portfolio of more than 30 brands and nearly 9,000 properties.\nOther business highlights include continued momentum with AEP and native applications, growing subscription revenue 60% year over year in Q2. AEP innovations announced at Summit include Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, a new application for B2B customers built on AEP to orchestrate account-specific buying group journeys, Federated Audience Composition, which enables enterprises to minimize data copy and generate audiences directly from their enterprise data warehouses, and Real Time CDP Collaboration, a new clean room application for brands and publishers to collaborate in a privacy-safe way to discover, reach, and measure their high-value audiences.\nA world without third party cookies.

Recent advancements include contextual search in Adobe Experience Manager Assets, which enables users to find the right asset and variation in their growing digital libraries.\nAdobe Workflow Planning, which provides every user with a unified view of all activities across the marketing lifecycle through highly visual marketing campaign calendars and dynamic briefs, and AEM Generate Variations, which accelerates the creation of audience-specific content variations to drive personalized web experiences. Strong industry analyst recognition, including Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Content Marketing Platforms, and leadership for both IDC's B2C and B2B MarketScapes for digital commerce applications.\nKey customer wins include Amazon, British Telecom, Comcast, Mercedes Benz, Maruti Suzuki, Nationwide Building Society, Novo Nordisk, ServiceNow, Stellantis, Ulta Beauty, and US Department of the Treasury.\nWe have enabled our vibrant partner ecosystem of system integrators and agencies to deliver advisory and implementation services across our product portfolio. We look forward to engaging with customers in major agencies at the Cannes Lions Festival later this month. Our category-leading solutions, robust pipeline, and tremendous scale position us to drive strong growth in the second half, and we are raising our subscription revenue target for the year. I will now pass it to Dan.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Today I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q2 fiscal 2024, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets in Q2. Adobe delivered strong top line growth and industry leading profitability while accelerating the pace of innovations we're delivering to market across Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud. In the quarter, Adobe achieved record revenue of $5.31 billion, which represents 10% year over year growth or 11% in constant currency, with strength across all three clouds.\nThis performance stems from the diversification of Adobe's business across our market leading products, business models, customer segments, and geographies. When combined with our talented employees, strong execution, and world class financial discipline, you have the ingredients that make this company incredibly resilient.\nSecond quarter business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.49, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.48, digital media revenue of $3.91 billion, net new digital media ARR of $487 million, digital experience revenue of $1.33 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.94 billion, and RPO of $17.86 billion exiting the quarter. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q2 revenue of $3.91 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 12% in constant currency.\nWe exited the quarter with $16.25 billion of digital media ARR, up 13% year over year in constant currency. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $782 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth as reported, and in constant currency. We added $165 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, which was a record for Q2.\nQ2 Document Cloud growth drivers included demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments and geographies, new user acquisition resulting from increasing Reader mail, a great start monetizing AI Assistant through our digital channel, strong usage and engagement from Acrobat Web, as well as through our Chrome and Edge partnerships, which are driving free to paid conversion, growing team subscription units sold to SMBs both through adobe.com and our reseller channel, and strength in our enterprise solutions demonstrating the importance of PDF as a source of unstructured data in business workflows.\nWe achieved Creative revenue of $3.13 billion, which represents 10% year over year growth, or 11% in constant currency. We added $322 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. Q2 creative growth drivers included new subscriptions for Creative Cloud all apps, with particular strength in digital acquisition on Adobe.com, with multiple product releases during the quarter driving customer engagement and demand.\nStrong growth of single apps, including in imaging, photography, design, and stock, accelerating customer interest and usage for our new Express Mobile and Express for Business offerings, strong renewals as customers migrate to higher value, higher ARPU Creative Cloud plans that include Firefly entitlements, continued subscription unit growth with particular strength in emerging markets, and strength from SMBs adopting our team offering as well as in the enterprise segment with ETLA adoption. We're pleased with the performance of the creative business in the first half of the year, fueled by strong commercial subscriptions in both Q1 and Q2.\nAs we look at the momentum we're carrying into the back half, we expect to deliver year-over-year growth of Creative net new ARR in Q3 and Q4, and are raising our Digital Media net new ARR target for the fiscal year. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q2 we achieved revenue of $1.33 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $1.20 billion, growing 13% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency.\nQ2 digital experience growth drivers included subscription revenue strength from transformational accounts, market leadership with AEP and native applications, with subscription revenue growing 60% year over year, additional subscription revenue strength across the data, insights, and audiences and customer journey categories, and accelerated adoption of our AEM and Workfront solutions from businesses looking to solve their content supply chain challenges.\nTurning to the income statement and balance sheet in Q2, Adobe delivered year over year EPS growth of 24% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. This was driven by revenue growth and disciplined prioritization of our investments, which resulted in non-GAAP operating margin strength in Q2. The company continues to deliver world-class gross margins while investing in groundbreaking AI capabilities. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 18.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations for the quarter.\nRPO exiting the quarter was $17.86 billion, growing 17% year over year as reported, or 18% when factoring in a one point currency headwind. Current RPO grew 12% exiting the quarter. Our ending cash and short term investment position at the end of Q2 was $8.07 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.94 billion. In Q2, we entered into a $2.5 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $22.7 billion remaining of the $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024.\nWe will now provide Q3 targets as well as updated fiscal 2024 annual targets, factoring in current macroeconomic conditions, strong momentum across our business, our current FX outlook into the back half of the year with the US Dollar remaining stronger as compared to our original expectations when we set our FY24 targets in December, and an expected strong seasonal finish to the year in Q4. For Q3, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.33 to 5.38 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $460 million, digital media segment revenue of $3.95 to 3.98 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $1.325 to 1.345 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $1.20 to 1.22 billion, tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nGAAP earnings per share $3.45 to 3.50 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.50 to 4.55 for fiscal 2024. Given our first half performance, we are now targeting total Adobe revenue of $21.40 to 21.50 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $1.95 billion, digital media segment revenue of $15.80 to 15.85 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $5.325 to 5.375 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $4.775 to 4.825 billion, tax rate of approximately 20.5% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $11.80 to 12 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18 to 18.20. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the company's performance in the first half of the year, and the momentum we see in our business.\nAdobe's product leadership, velocity of innovation, diversity of our business, and financial discipline make us unique, enabling us to deliver strong top and bottom line results through dynamic market conditions. I'm confident in our ability to catalyze transformative long term trends that will position us to win over the next decade. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks Dan. Adobe remains one of the greatest places to work in the industry, and I want to thank our employees for their relentless dedication to supporting our customers and communities. We continue to invest in hiring, including new college grads and interns, to bring the best and brightest talent to Adobe. This quarter, Adobe was recognized among Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Glassdoor's Best Led Companies, and the Civic 50 list of the most community-minded companies in the US. Demand for our category-defining products and services continues to grow. Our business fundamentals and market tailwinds are strong, and we look forward to building on our momentum in the second half and beyond. Thank you, and we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touchtone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that will be star one if you would like to signal with questions. Our first question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director, Senior VP, and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter, and especially the strong net new ARR. I'd like to ask a little more color on specifically the net new ARR that we saw in Creative Cloud. Can you give us a sense of what the contribution near term, medium term to digital ARR from seat growth versus upsell versus consumption, things like Adobe Stock and AI credits, even rank ordering or quantifying anything you can give us to give us a sense of what's driving that number, and that would be very helpful in really understanding what's going on and the drivers of that number. Thanks.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nSure, Mark, let me start, and then certainly David and Dan can add to your point. We had a strong quarter, and I think what's really driving the quarter, big picture, continues to be the innovation that we're delivering and the way AI is actually making our applications both more affordable, easy to onboard, as well as, frankly, higher value uses. New users are still a big driver of the growth that we continue to see in the business. On the Document Cloud side, a lot of that has to do with the introduction of AI Assistant and the fact that people are migrating to the higher value products, and on Creative Cloud, I would say the things that we're doing on Imaging with Firefly and what we've seen both in Photoshop and Lightroom.\nI think in the prepared remarks, Dan certainly talked about what's happening with also each of the different segments. The SMB segment actually had a strong quarter. Enterprise continues to have a strong quarter. You know, across the board, Mark, we actually saw strength in the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on just an incredible result. I wanted to ask, kind of just similar to Mark's question, just how much GenAI demand did you see in the quarter in terms of both the Creative Cloud portfolio and digital media in Creative Studio as well as in GenStudio? How does it kind of help pick up more on the enterprise side of the business or the SMB side of the business, help us understand that progression as to maybe how you're planning forward in the back half of the DNR guide.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nAlex, again, maybe I'll start with that. You know, just taking a step back, I think we've talked about, you know, the platform that we have for GenAI that, you know, constitutes data as well as models, and finally interfaces on the models. We released Firefly Services. We've started to see some customer wins in Firefly Services. They're using it for variations, and these are the custom models that we're creating, as well as access to APIs. I would say that's early in terms of the adoption, but the interest as customers say how they can ingest their data into our models as well as custom models, that's really ahead of us. We expect that to continue to grow in Q3 and Q4.\nI think the biggest opportunity for us and why we're really excited about GenAI is in the interfaces because that's the way people derive value, whether it's in being able to complete their tasks faster, whether it's be able to do new workflows. I would say in that particular space, Acrobat has really seen a significant amount of usage as it relates to AI Assistant and Photoshop.\nI'll have David again add. Generative Fill and what we are doing there, what we are doing in Illustrator, and that both for existing customers as well as for prospects who now come in and say the products are becoming increasingly more productive for us, that's what's really driving the value there. Last but not least, the AI first applications.\nWhen we think of an application like Express, Express is all about reimagining what we can do for creatives by sort of leapfrogging existing technologies and providing an AI first application. That's also off to a good start.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Just to add to a little bit of what Shantanu said, Alex, you know, we've talked a lot about how FY23 was the year that AI was in the playground and this is the year we need to bring it into production. A lot of that is industry wide, but we're in a pretty special position as it relates to that. To Shantanu's point, a lot of active releases this quarter, right? Acrobat, AI Assistant, Firefly updates in Photoshop. Firefly was introduced for the first time into Lightroom. Express Mobile launched. Express for Business launched. We launched Firefly Services for enterprises to produce content at scale. As you can see, there was a ton of innovation in our core applications around Generative AI.\nYou put that together with some of the activations that we've done at Summit, we did at MAX London, and we're getting our word out very broadly. It starts to create this ability to not just look at and play with AI, but actually use it as part of your workflow. That's been deeply integrated into everything we do, and that's the key point. The interfaces that people work at, if we bring AI there, everyone becomes more productive.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nMaybe one last thing, Alex. Sequentially, if you look at it from a route to market, Digital had a very strong quarter as it relates to what we did on adobe.com. We had talked about enterprise doing well in Q1 as well. That continued, and SMB, also the interest in our team's product, also continued to do really well. I think sequentially I would point to SMB and digital strength as driving the further growth.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's super helpful. Maybe just one on the macro, just given your guys' purview, what is the story that you're seeing in terms of the macro and the demand environment? Clearly, again, you're commenting on solid performance in the SMB and in the enterprise. Is there any areas that you're seeing pockets of weaknesses that are really vertical dependent? You know, what, just maybe give a comment on kind of how we should think about it as we look to the rest of the year.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nI think from a macro perspective, you know what I think differentiates Adobe more than any other company is how differentiated and how diverse the set of products that we have. Again, from individual consumers all the way to enterprises, our products are mission critical. At this point, scale, it's all about execution, you know, and the business cycles will come and go, Alex, but we're actually continuing to focus on execution and converting the pipeline, the interest, and the awareness of AI into monetization. You know, we just will be ruthlessly focused on continuing to execute against that. Nothing really to report different on the macroeconomic environment from our perspective.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAwesome. Keep doing what you're doing, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here, and echo the congrats on the quarter, maybe for both you, Shantanu and David. There are clearly just so many layers to the Firefly monetization story. I think one theme that's coming out a little bit in this call, and particularly interesting routes to monetize, is just the increased engagement that Firefly helps drive in your flagship products, or I think what we call sort of the interfaces. Right.\nAn example there would be like Generative Fill for Photoshop, and you've clearly started expanding that to other flagships like Premiere and Illustrator. Maybe to go one level deeper, is there a way that you think about the potential, potential opportunity from things like higher retention rates or any other way that. I know it's really tough to size, but how have you sort of thought about it, even qualitatively?\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, it's a great question. Yeah, the core has been from the very beginning we talked to you guys about. Our primary focus for generative AI is about user adoption and proliferation, right? That has continued to be the primary thing on our mind. It's the primary thing on our mind for multiple reasons. To your point, there are many different ways that we can monetize this.\nFirst is, you know, as you think about the growth algorithms that we always have in our head, it always starts with, as Shantanu said, new users, right, and then it's about getting more value to existing users at higher ARPU. Right.\nIn the context of new users, first and foremost we want to make sure that everything we're doing in generative AI is embedded in our tools, starting with Express, right? We have Express in the market. We're seeing a lot of adoption and usage of Express in the market. As that's happening, we're infusing generative AI more and more into Express in a whole host of ways, and that's really helping everything from our marketing message for the completeness of the AI offering in there, all the way through to user engagement, success, onboarding, and retention. Similarly, though, this is having the same effect in our core creative products as well, right.\nThe introduction of Firefly, combined with some of the product-led growth work we've been doing, in particular something called the context bar, makes it easy for new users coming in to just be more successful out of the gate, which then, of course, helps with both conversion and retention. With AI Assistant, the ability to sort of embed that into the purchase flow for Acrobat and get a high attach rate, we always talk about that as a would you like fries with it? moment at Adobe. When someone's going through the checkout flow, it's just a great way for people to say, look, this is value. I want, I want to add it and buy up to the higher plan.\nThere are a lot of different mechanisms that we see, but by far the strongest is going to be the fact that we are seeing people, like in Creative Cloud, migrating to the higher priced plans because they include Firefly. We just want to get more value to these users as well.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nIn terms of the generation, Saket, I think we talked about it. We did a great job at MAX in London talking about some of the new functionality and releasing Photoshop. I think we're up to 9 billion generations, and actually, I think the greatest amount of generations was in May. The momentum clearly is the more we integrate this functionality into our interfaces, the more that usage is really driving adoption as well as retention.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nDavid, on Express, you mentioned the success you're seeing. Can you maybe drill in to some of the other metrics and accomplishments that you're seeing out of Express this quarter?\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, for starters, you know there's a lot of buzz at Express here at Adobe coming off the event we just had earlier this week, but it's really based on the fact that the innovation in Express is on a tear. Right. A few months ago we introduced an all new Express for the web. This quarter we introduced an all new Express for mobile, we introduced Express for business.\nWe also now have, as we just talked about, been more deeply integrating AI features, whether it's for imaging generation, generative fill, text effects, or character animation design generations more deeply into the flow for Express. That combination has led to an incredible set of metrics over the last quarter in particular, building throughout the year. Express MAU is growing very quickly. We talked about in the script earlier that on mobile, it has more than doubled quarter over quarter, which is fantastic to see. Cumulative exports, if you look at year over year, have grown by over 80%.\nReally feeling good about sort of the momentum we're seeing. If you take a step back, I think it is important to take a step back and understand our vision. Express that is now in market is built on a brand new platform, right?\nThat brand new platform lays the groundwork for the AI era. This will be. Express will be the place that anyone can come and create through a combination of conversational and standard inputs. That's the vision that we have, and I think it's an opportunity for us to really leap forward in terms of what we can do on the web and mobile at Adobe.\nYou know, it's taken us a little time to get here, it hasn't happened overnight, but now that we are here, we are going to pour the gas on, go to market. Right. You know what we can do with our data driven operating model. We've been ramping up what we're doing in Digital and adobe.com journeys. We now can do the same thing and unleash all of that expertise in the mobile app store.\nYou know what we're capable in terms of our product-led growth motions, Acrobat. We've now embedded Express workflows into Acrobat Editor. We obviously have been embedding it into Creative Cloud workflows, and also as we showed at Summit with Anil, we've embedded it into our Experience Cloud workflows as well. In addition to all of that, we're now unleashing our inside sales force to target the small and medium businesses.\nOur education teams are really gearing up for the back-to-school launch for K through 12 and higher ed, and our field and enterprise sales now have Express for Business. We're doing all this globally, right? It's a massive market, and we're ramping up, and we're ready to go.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Enterprise Software Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you very much. I'll add my congratulations for your creative business. How are you thinking about the Q side of the P x Q equation over the balance of the year based on these numbers? I would certainly assume that you had really healthy unit growth in Q2, and I'm wondering if you expect that to continue.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, I mean, again, I think what it is, this mix of product innovation that we've been putting out there and the steady drumbeat of that, a lot of it getting attention because of the quality and the hooks of AI and being able to sort of bring people onboarding them quickly and successfully into the product.\nAs we talked about, the more they use these AI features, the more they retain, and we feel really good about really that whole workflow. Yeah, the new user growth continues to be our primary focus. When you add in everything we're doing with Express, again, like I said, we're off to the races, and we feel very good about the momentum on new user acquisition and existing member retention.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nGregg, as you're aware, I mean certainly with Express we also have the model of customer acquisition as it relates to people coming in through trial and free and then conversion. We are seeing the interest level as it relates to Express in particular, significant interest.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Enterprise Software Analyst, Mizuho\n\nShantanu, since you also called out the strength in digital earlier, including driving new Creative Cloud, all app subscriptions from your website, are you doing anything different that's helping to drive that behavior? If so, is that something you think can continue as well?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nYou know, I would, Gregg, in sort of modesty say we've been world class at sort of driving that for a long time now. The team, I think, continues to do an amazing job. I would say David referred to the DDOM, you know, Adobe Home is now sort of increasingly the way that we're driving a lot of, you know, people to get aware of our new products.\nI would say the mobile part as well, and the mobile journeys as we've got these mobile products, whether it's Lightroom or whether it's, you know, certainly Express, that's an area of increasing focus for us, and you know, the traditional sort of understanding where search terms are, I think we're getting better and better at that, which leads to way more digital traffic for us. I think it's across the board.\nI'd also highlight, I mean, the commerce team that we have at Adobe that understands, you know, what the segments are and how for those particular segments we can attract people. That's great. I mean, I think in the prepared remarks, Dan also talked about the strength in emerging markets. You know, I think the beautiful part about AI is that since they need access to the cloud to get, you know, all of the AI functionality, emerging market growth has been really strong for us.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Enterprise Software Analyst, Mizuho\n\nVery helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMoving on to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you guys for taking the question, and again, congratulations on a really solid set of results in an environment where not very many software companies have been able to beat and raise in this. Type of uneven environment. I wanted to maybe focus in a. Little bit on the question that Mark Moerdler asked, in particular on what gives you guys the confidence to see a return to year-on-year growth in Creative Cloud net new ARR. It declined in Q2, declined in Q1, and if I'm not mistaken, decline in Q2 was a little bit steeper than what we saw in Q1.\nWhat are the particular drivers, and maybe some detail on those drivers, that give you guys the confidence that that trend line that has been actually heading in the wrong direction is going to head in the right direction, now we're actually going to see growth in those metrics in Q3 and Q4?\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYes. Thanks, Keith. This is one of the areas that I think we've shared with you, the complexity of the year-over-year comparisons in the first half based on prior pricing marks that we had. More importantly to your point, the year-over-year complexities are now behind us, and we're very excited about the momentum of the first half and how it sets us up for the second half, frankly, across both Document Cloud and Creative Cloud.\nBoth are really momentum stories. You know, the 478, 487. Sorry, just to be clear, the 487 that we printed this time is obviously strong performance, and it implies that both CC and DC came in over what the growth guide would have implied otherwise. Right. It's giving us a lot of good momentum going into the back half. Now, the momentum is really driven by three things, and I'll try to share a little bit more context here and hopefully give you. First is new user acquisition. Right?\nWe're seeing Express starting to perform well in terms of bringing a lot of new users into the franchise across mobile and web. AI Assistant and Reader has been a really nice start for us, and we've been very pleased with how the uptake on that's going, too.\nFirefly itself, as I mentioned, has been increasingly more productive in terms of bringing and onboarding users, and then retaining users because of the growth we continue. As we drive that more holistically throughout the product set, we start to see more people using it, including, as Shantanu mentioned earlier, in emerging markets. We are seeing very good strength and usage in emerging markets, and that has certainly been a bright spot for us, which is something that obviously represents a lot of potential and upside for us.\nIn terms of existing customers migration has been going very well for us as well. More people are moving to the higher priced, higher value plans because of the Firefly capabilities. We're even seeing this in enterprises where people are moving up to the highest versions of Creative Cloud, which is what we call Creative Cloud Enterprise 4, because they get more access to features beyond just generation.\nThey have more collaborative capabilities beyond just kind of sharing via email. We're starting to see that create a nice momentum and upgrade cycles in the enterprise segment as well. Certainly, let's not forget the new offerings too. While still early, automation and content production is something that we're driving effectively in a lot of these accounts with Firefly Services.\nThat mix of new users, existing user migration, and also the new offerings that we have in market are driving that growth formula that we talked about, which is now P x Q + V for value with these automation services.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt is a great answer. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the generative credit component to your pricing here. It seems like with all the progress you've made embedding Firefly across the key flagship products, and the engagement levels that you're seeing, we should start to see perhaps some ramp in that generative credit component to your pricing. Is that a fair assessment? Would you expect to start to see that coming in, or should we look to other services like the video capabilities that you're going to be launching shortly as a key catalyst there?Thank you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nI think you're right, Brad. When we think about what we've done with imaging and video, we've done the right thing by making sure the higher value paid products plans that people don't have to think about the amount of generative capability, and there, you know, the balance between for free and trialless users, they're going to run into the generative capability limits and therefore have to subscribe.\nFor the people who actually have imaging and vector needs that they're not constantly thinking about generative, I think we actually got it right. To your point, as we move to video, expect to see different plans because those plans will by necessity take into account the amount of work that's required to do video generation. You're absolutely right.\nAs a sort of framework for you to think about it, the two other things that I would say is, I mean, clearly Express is really being driven by sort of the need for AI and how people are able to describe what they want and get the final output. You know, when David talked about exports, just to clarify what that means is people who have successfully got what they want to get done done, and that's a key measure of how we are doing it.\nAI is certainly facilitating and accelerating that. Last thing I would say, Brad, is, as you know, on the Acrobat side, it's a slightly different model which we like, which is anybody who has Reader and is looking at a document, they can have an upsell to the AI Assistant.\nIf you have Acrobat Pro, you can upsell to the AI Assistant. If you're a brand new acquisition of a user, when you're coming in, you know, the adoption of the highest value products. Between Standard Pro and Pro plus Assistant, we've been pleased to see how many people are migrating to the Pro plus Assistant. Hopefully, that gives you some color of how we think about it differently by product.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nVery helpful, thank you, Shantanu.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank",
    "content2": "Great, thank you so much, and congrats to all of you. I don't want Anil to feel left out. I'm going to ask a DX question. Anil, it's good to hear AEP is on track to become the next billion dollar business for Adobe. Can you expand on the journey and drivers that get you there? In particular, how important are cloud migrations and how do you see AEP. AI Assistant perhaps accelerating the journey to a billion? Thanks.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThank you, Brad. Appreciate it. As you know, I mean customer experience management, and especially it's been a hugely. Important priority area for Chief Marketing Officers. With CIOs and Chief Digital Officers as well, for us, we are focused on personalization at scale, which is really built around the AEP platform. We are the largest provider in this space, and we are growing faster than any of our peers, and we are the number one digital experience platform as a result. That has really helped us keep the momentum.\nWhen you think about the AEP AI Assistant, it's doing a couple of things. One, it's really making it easier for customers to deploy use cases. When you think of use cases that they have around, for example, generating audiences and running campaigns around those audiences, these are things today that require some data engineering. They require the ability to put these audiences together, so they require marketing and IT teams to work together.\nThe API assistant is making it much easier for marketers to be able to do it themselves and be able to deploy a lot more use cases. As there's more usage, it'll help drive more consumption and help drive the growth in terms of number of profiles, number of users. We see it helping us grow towards that billion dollar business.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat to hear and keep up the great work, guys. Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nHey operator, we're almost at the top of the hour. We'll take two last questions and then wrap up. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take a question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much. You guys could have three separate earnings. Calls because you had three different businesses. Even the smallest one is very large. Yes, sorry, Anil, Dave, and Shantanu. I may not be able to ask all the questions that I want. I'm sure we have plenty, but I'll just keep it super high level. Shantanu, generative AI seems to swing back and forth, just so early in its evolution.\nThe possibilities seem magical, sometimes endless, sometimes it feels very disappointing. With every quarter that Adobe is executing on this path, where do you stand with the question that we do get from investors? Will generative AI be so good that it's the end of the creative process, so we don't need creative folks, the software will do everything? That sounds a little far-fetched, but I'm just throwing it out there to see how you would react to that proposition. Same in the Experience Cloud as well.\nCould generative AI create its own marketing campaign? Put marketing people out of business? Maybe it doesn't. I'm sure you have strong views, maybe flipped on the other side, it does create category growth. On the other hand, not category compression. Sorry for that super high level question, but that seems to be a big debate on the stock here, at least from the long term perspective. Thank you so much.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah, Kash. I think the two things when we talk to investors that are perhaps on their mind, I mean, I think the first is it's fair to say that the interest that exists right now from investors as it relates to AI is all associated with the infrastructure and chips, and perhaps rightly so, because that's where, you know, everybody is creating these models, they're all trying to train them, and there's a lot of, I think, deserved excitement associated with that part of where we are in the evolution of generative AI. If the value of AI doesn't turn to inference and how people are going to use it, then I would say all of that investment would not really reap the benefit in terms of where people are spending the money.\nYou know, we're always convinced that when you have this kind of disruptive technology, the real benefits come when people use interfaces to do whatever task they want to do, quicker, faster, and when it's embedded into the workflows that they're accustomed to because then there isn't an inertia associated with using it. With that sort of as a broad segment, I am a big believer that generative AI is going to, for all the categories that we're in, it's actually going to dramatically expand the market because it's going to make our products more accessible, more affordable, more productive in terms of what we can do.\nI'm still acting CMO at the company and I see the excitement around how we can, with agility, create way more content, create variations. When Anil talked about personalization at scale, I think there are two aspects to it, right? I mean, the first was always data. Anil and the team have done a great job with sort of the real time customer data platform to get that, and that's hydrated with users.\nThe real value is when you infuse that with the right content to make that personalized experience. I think the demand is there for way more content than people can do. Generative AI is going to be an accelerant in that as well. Net net, I am absolutely betting on the fact that five years from now, there will be more people saying I'm using creative tools to accomplish what I want, and there'll be more marketers saying I can now, with the agility that I need, truly deliver a marketing campaign and an audience that's incredibly more specific than I could in the past.\nThat's Adobe's job, to demonstrate how we are both leading in both those categories, and to continue to innovate. I recognize and I understand the question that exists in the industry associated with AI. If the value doesn't accrue to interfaces, I'll leave you with that. I think the investment would not be as beneficial as I believe it can be.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nMaybe one thing to add to that, Kash, just to build on what Shantanu was talking about, I think the other thing we get asked a fair amount is about the comparison between different models, right? Firefly might be better at something, Midjourney might be better at something else. You know, DALL·E might do something else. The key thing here is that around this table, we get excited when models innovate.\nWe get excited when Firefly does something amazing. We get excited when third-party models do something, because our view, to Shantanu's point, is that the more content that gets generated out of these models, the more content that needs to be edited, whether it's color correction, tone matching, transitions, assembling clips, or masking and compositing images.\nThe reason for this is that this is not a game where there's going to be one model. Each model is going to have its own personality, what it generates, what it looks like, how fast it generates, how much it costs when it generates that. To have some interface layer to help synthesize all of this is important. Just sort of to note, we've said this before, but I'll say it again here. You will see us building our products, tools, and services, leveraging Firefly for sure. You'll also see us leveraging best-of-breed personalities from different models and integrate them all together.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAwesome. The message here is that GenAI is going to create more growth in the category. Shantanu, you did that with the pivot to cloud, you grew the category. Here we go again. Thank you so much.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Kash.\n\nOperator\n\nNext will be Jake Roberge with William Blair.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nHey, thanks for taking the questions, and I'll echo my congrats on the great quarter. I know it's early, but what's been the feedback in customer behavior for those users that are on Firefly Services and GenStudio, and then thinking more longer term, what type of price uplift could you see from those customers over time? Just given what you said about the acceleration in Firefly generations being driven by those products. Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nMaybe I'll start with customer zero. Right before this meeting, I was in a meeting with our CMO, and, well, sometimes it's hard to tell if he's wearing the CMO or CEO hat, but CMO this time, and we were reviewing a full funnel campaign that we're planning on launching later this year.\nExactly as Shantanu mentioned earlier, we saw, you know, benefits in terms of cost of the campaign, faster time to market for the campaign, and the amount of content that we can create to personalize that campaign. That is one of those things that we've been doing more and more around our DDOM, which has actually been very productive for us, as you can see this quarter, and what we're pitching to other customers.\nWe have been working with, we listed some of the customers earlier, but we've been working with a long list of customers on everything from accelerating the content creation for social, accelerating content creation for regional, and then increasing the amount of content that's created for increased personalization, which then, of course, flows into all of the Experience Cloud products that Anil is working on to get targeted better.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nJake, maybe in terms of what I would say we're seeing usage of, I think the initial usage of Firefly Services in most companies was all around ideation. How can they create multiple variations of them and, you know, in the ideation process, really just accelerate that ideation process. Most companies are then starting with, as they're putting it into production, how can they, with the brand assets and the brand guidelines that they have, do this in terms of the variations, whether they be geographic variations or they be just variations.I mean, if you take a step.\nBack also, every single ad company right now will tell you that the more variants that you provide, the better your chances are of appropriately getting an uplift for your media spend. I would say that most companies are starting with creating these variations for geographies. The other one that we see a fair amount of is engaging with their communities. When they want their communities to have assets that they have blessed for usage within community campaigns, that's the other place where Firefly services are being used.\nA company has a community portal where the community can come in, take something, and then, you know, post whether it's on whatever social media site that you want. I think that's the initial one. All of the agency companies are companies that have actually even publicly said how GenStudio is something that they have embraced, but even the large media companies, because the media companies are certainly interested in understanding how all of this GenAI could be used to automate, as well as accelerate, the amount of content that they can produce.\nHopefully that gives you some color of it. If there's been sort of the questions that they ask along the way, which hopefully, and actually luckily, we have great answers. It's all around the indemnification and how they can use it. I would say that continues to be a really key differentiator for us. Since that is the last question, let me just say I'm proud of how we executed in Q2, both across the product innovation, delivery, as well as, you know, the go to market.\nBecause clearly a number of you asked, you know, how we were able to put together these numbers. Where others have perhaps talked about the macroeconomic environment, we certainly remain focused on leveraging technology to delight a broader set of customers. At the end of the day, to the questions that we were asked, we believe that the real value of AI will be in the interfaces that individuals, enterprises use to accomplish their tasks and workflows. We think we're incredibly well positioned. Thank you for joining us.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks everyone. This concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had a strong Q1. We achieved $5.18 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 12% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.36, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.48, representing 18% year-over-year growth. Our performance reflects the essential role that Adobe products play in driving the global digital economy. We're delivering on our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity, and power digital businesses.\nAdobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud are more critical than ever to the success of creators, communicators, students, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes, with AI serving as an accelerant for all. We're a leader in delivering generative AI across all our clouds. We're taking a highly differentiated approach across data, models, and interfaces.\nOur proprietary data is built on decades of deep domain expertise across creative, documents, and customer experience management. We leverage large language models, as well as have invested in building and delivering our proprietary models in the creative, document, and marketing domains. Our IP-friendly approach is a differentiator for creators and enterprises. In addition, we've innovated by delivering generative AI directly in products, with releases in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Express across both desktop and mobile.\nAI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader unlocks the tremendous value of the trillions of PDFs around the world. We're bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud, and we'll demonstrate our AI Assistant for customer experience management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional, and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create, and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels.\nAdobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat, and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we're already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We're driving strong usage, value, and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments.\nWe're successfully monetizing our innovations, with particular strength in Q1 in the enterprise segment across our digital media and digital experience businesses. This strength is reflected in our strong RPO growth of 16% year-over-year. We're pleased with a strong Q1. We have a phenomenal product roadmap that we're executing against to bring AI innovation across our global customer base, and we are just getting started. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q1, we achieved net new digital media ARR of $432 million and revenue of $3.82 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. The world's information, whether it's an enterprise legal contract, a small business invoice, or a personal school form, lives in trillions of PDFs. We were thrilled to announce Acrobat AI Assistant, a massive leap forward on our journey to bring intelligence to PDFs. With AI Assistant, we're combining the power of generative AI with our unique understanding of the PDF file format to transform the way people interact with and instantly extract additional value from their most important documents.\nEnabled by a proprietary attribution engine, AI Assistant is deeply integrated into Reader and Acrobat workflows. It instantly generates summaries and insights from long documents, answers questions through a conversational interface, and provides an on-ramp for generating emails, reports, and presentations.AI Assistant is governed by secure data protocols so that customers can use the capabilities with confidence. We're pleased with the initial response to the English language beta and look forward to usage ramping across our customer base as we release other languages later in the year.\nWe will monetize this functionality through a monthly add-on offering to the hundreds of millions of Reader users, as well as the Acrobat install base across individuals, teams, and enterprises. In Q1, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $750 million, growing 18% year-over-year. We added $143 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, which was a Q1 record, with year-over-year ending ARR growth of 23% in constant currency. Other business highlights include Acrobat Web continues to be an incredible source of customer acquisition, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year and surpassing 100 million users in Q1.\nAcrobat extensions for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, and our Acrobat mobile offerings, continue to accelerate free-to-pay conversion. Increased viral adoption through link sharing and stakeholder collaboration drove over 300% year-over-year growth in the number of PDF files sent. Key enterprise customer wins include Berkshire Hathaway, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Northrop Grumman, Porsche, and the US Navy. On Creative Cloud, creativity is the currency of differentiation in our digital-first world.\nEvery creator and business is focused on building their brand and engaging with their audiences through standout content. Creative Cloud remains the solution of choice for the world's creators, whether their medium is design, photography, video, illustration, or 3D. Adobe Express is inspiring millions of users of all skill levels to design more quickly and easily than ever before.\nIn the year since we announced and released Adobe Firefly, our creative generative AI models, we have aggressively integrated this functionality into both our Creative Cloud flagship applications and, more recently, Adobe Express, delighting millions of users who have generated over 6.5 billion assets to date. In addition to creating proprietary foundation models, Firefly includes a web-based interface for ideation and rapid prototyping, which has seen tremendous adoption.\nWe also recently introduced Firefly Services, an AI platform which enables every enterprise to embed and extend our technology into their creative production and marketing workflows. Firefly Services is currently powered by our commercially safe models and includes the ability for enterprises to create their own custom models by providing their proprietary data sets, as well as to embed this functionality through APIs into their email, media placement, social, and web creation process.\nEarly adopters like IBM are putting Firefly at the center of their content creation processes. IBM used Adobe Firefly to generate 200 campaign assets and over 1,000 marketing variations in moments rather than months. The campaign drove 26x higher engagement than its benchmark and reached more key audiences. In Q1, we achieved $3.07 billion in revenue, which grew 12% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $289 million. Other business highlights include the launch of the new Adobe Express mobile app beta, which brings the magic of Adobe Firefly AI models directly into mobile workflows.\nThe first of its kind integration with TikTok's Creative Assistant makes the creation and optimization of social media content quicker, easier, and more effective than ever before. Express web usage continues to ramp nicely, with total exports more than doubling year-over-year, and overall Express adoption is expected to accelerate even further, given the positive reception we're seeing from the mobile beta. Generative fill in Photoshop continues to empower creators to create in new ways and accelerate image editing workflows.\nQ1 saw the highest adoption of Firefly-powered tools in Photoshop since the release of generative fill in May 2023, with customers adopting these features across desktop, web, and, most recently, iPad, which added generative fill and generative expand in December. The beta release of AI-powered enhanced speech and new audio workflows drove Premiere beta usage to record highs. Adobe video tools were the go-to choice at Sundance Film Festival, with over 80% of this year's entrants using Adobe software.\nThe introduction of Behance Pro, a new offering to serve the rapidly growing Behance community, empowers members to build their brand and find opportunities, and for businesses to hire talented creators through the Behance platform. The unveiling of new research, like the preview of our music generation models and editing tools last month, and our video auto-dubbing models earlier today, have inspired our Creative Cloud and Express customers. The introduction of Firefly Services for enterprises drove notable wins in the quarter, including Accenture, IPG, and Starbucks.\nOther key enterprise wins include ACOM, Capital Group, Dentsu, IBM, Nintendo, and R.R. Donnelley. Given the size of opportunity we see with generative AI, we continue to focus on driving innovation, adoption, and usage of our AI solutions. In Q1, we saw strength across both clouds, with record new commercial subscriptions in Creative Cloud for Q1, and strong product-led growth in Document Cloud.\nYou can expect to see the product advances in Express with Firefly on mobile, Firefly Services, and AI Assistant in Acrobat drive ARR acceleration in the second half of the year. We're excited about our product roadmap. The $6.5 billion assets generated to date include images, vectors, designs, and text effects, and we can't wait to share the work we're doing on audio, video, and 3D through research sneaks and product announcements in the coming months. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. Experience Cloud business had a great Q1, achieving $1.29 billion in revenue and was our strongest Q1 on record for new business. Subscription revenue was $1.16 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Companies are prioritizing digital investments to improve marketing agility and customer engagement while driving growth and profitability.\nAdobe's holiday shopping report, which analyzes trillions of data points, showed strong online spending during the 2023 holiday season, growing 4.9% year-over-year to $222.1 billion, a new record for e-commerce, as well as mobile shopping, which surpassed desktop for the first time and drove 51.1% of online sales. Our Adobe Experience Cloud applications span the entire customer funnel, from acquisition to monetization to retention.\nAs the global leader in the digital experience platforms category, Adobe offers businesses a single view of their customers' data across every channel, allowing them to create precise segments and deliver personalized experiences, regardless of when and where a customer interacts with their brand. Over the last five years, our organic innovations in Adobe Experience Platform, real-time CDP, Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics have made us the leading platform for customer experience management, given the scale of the profiles, campaigns, and interactions we process, which now exceed 500 trillion segment evaluations per month.\nToday, rollout of personalization at scale has been limited by the number of content variations you can create, and the number of journeys you can deploy. We believe harnessing generative AI will be the next accelerant, with Creative Cloud, Firefly Services, and GenStudio providing a comprehensive solution for the content supply chain, and generative experience model automating the creation of personalized journeys. Adobe GenStudio is a generative AI-first application that allows marketers to quickly plan, create, store, deliver, and measure marketing content in a single, intuitive offering.\nWith state-of-the-art generative AI powered by Firefly Services, marketers can create on-brand content with unprecedented scale and agility to deliver personalized experiences. Adobe GenStudio natively integrates with multiple Adobe applications across Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud, including Express, Firefly, Workfront, Experience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, and Journey Optimizer. It can be used by brands and their agency partners to unlock new levels of creativity and efficiency in marketing campaigns.\nBusiness highlights include momentum with Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, with the combined annualized book of business surpassing $800 million in the quarter. Demand for Adobe Experience Manager, Workfront, and GenStudio to address the enterprise content supply chain. Global agencies, including Accenture Song, AWAS, IPG, Omnicom, and Publicis, have standardized on Adobe as their technology platform of choice for their own workflows, and to optimize creative collaboration with the world's leading brands.\nStrength in Adobe Journey Optimizer and Adobe Campaign as companies look to deliver more personalized experiences across channels and surfaces. Adobe was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for digital experience platforms for the seventh consecutive year, as well as the Forrester Wave for digital experience platforms. Adobe Experience Manager assets was also named a leader for the fourth consecutive time in the Forrester Wave for digital asset management.\nKey customer wins include Carl Zeiss, Comcast, Home Depot, NASCAR, Nestlé, PayPal, Rogers Communications, Santander Group, Starbucks, and Walgreens. Later this month, we are excited to host Adobe Summit, the world's largest digital experience conference in Las Vegas, where we'll be joined by thousands of customers, partners, and developers from around the world. We look forward to showcasing a number of product innovations, including a new generative experience model, advances in Adobe GenStudio, a new AI assistant in Adobe Experience Platform, new capabilities in RTCDP for first-party data activation, and expanded Firefly Services offerings.\nWe will articulate our vision and playbook for brands to achieve a new level of personalization at scale in the era of generative AI. We look forward to sharing our exciting product roadmap and hearing from our customers on how Adobe is helping them transform their business. We were off to a fast start in Q1 and look forward to continuing the momentum and leadership in Q2 and beyond. I will now pass it to Dan.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q1 fiscal 2024, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. In Q1, Adobe delivered another quarter of double-digit top-line growth with robust margins that result from product leadership, strong execution, and financial discipline. The pace of our product innovation across Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud is leading to customers making large, multi-year commitments to Adobe, and you see the result of those customer investments in our RPO performance, which accelerated to 16% year-over-year growth.\nIn the quarter, Adobe achieved record revenue of $5.18 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 12% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $1.36, non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $4.48, digital media revenue of $3.82 billion, net new digital media ARR of $432 million, digital experience revenue of $1.29 billion. Cash flows from operations of $1.17 billion, RPO of $17.58 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 3.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. GAAP EPS came in lower due to the billion-dollar payment resulting from the termination of the Figma transaction.\nAbsent the termination payment, our cash flows from operations would have been $1 billion more, and GAAP EPS would have been $2.19 higher. The termination payment impacts both Q1 GAAP EPS and our full-year fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $3.82 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency.\nWe exited the quarter with $15.76 billion of digital media ARR, up 14% year-over-year in constant currency. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $750 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. We added $143 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Q1 Document Cloud growth drivers included demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments and geographies, continued growth of Acrobat Web, demonstrating the success of our flagship products across multiple surfaces, growing monthly active users in our Acrobat Reader funnel, driving free-to-pay conversion.\nNew user acquisition resulting from our Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome partnerships, strength in our Teams business with upselling our new Acrobat offering, which includes integrated sign capabilities, and strong demand from businesses of all sizes, demonstrating the mission criticality of our document solutions. We achieved creative revenue of $3.07 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 12% in constant currency. We added $289 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter, with ending ARR growing 12% year-over-year in constant currency.\nOverall, CC pricing actions performed as expected in the quarter. Q1 net new creative ARR grew more than 20% year-over-year, excluding the impact of pricing actions associated with both Acrobat CC and all apps in the year-ago quarter, and Creative Cloud in Q1, FY 2024. Q1 creative growth drivers included new subscription growth, including strong adoption of Creative Cloud all apps across geographies and customer segments, strong single-app customer demand in creative categories such as imaging and photography, and continued growth of stock and Frame IO.\nWe again saw strength in emerging markets, which we continue to believe is a massive growth opportunity, and outstanding performance of Creative Cloud in the enterprise, including early traction of Firefly Services. Turning to our digital experience segment, in Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.29 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital experience subscription revenue is $1.16 billion, growing 12% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency.\nQ1 was a tremendous start to the year for our Experience Cloud business, with growth drivers including success closing transformational deals across geographies and verticals, with large enterprises that are choosing Adobe to be their end-to-end customer experience management platform. Continued momentum with AEP and native applications, with the annualized book of business growing more than 60% year-over-year, strong customer adoption of our content, campaign, and Workfront solutions, and continued strength with customer retention and expansion across our products.\nCustomer experience management remains an enterprise imperative, and as a leader in the category, we see a robust pipeline as we look into Q2 and beyond. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet, Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 36% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The Q1 GAAP tax rate came in higher than targeted due to the Figma termination payment. RPO exiting the quarter was a record $17.58 billion, growing 16% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $6.82 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.17 billion.\nIn Q1, we entered into a $2 billion share repurchase agreement, which effectively exhausted our prior $15 billion authority. As a result of our strong trajectory of growth and profitability, we are announcing a new $25 billion share repurchase program, which demonstrates Adobe's continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. In light of the momentum across our business, and factoring in the macroeconomic environment, for Q2, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.25 to $5.30 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $440 million, digital media segment revenue of $3.87 to $3.90 billion.\nDigital experience segment revenue of $1.31 to $1.33 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $1.165 to $1.185 billion, tax rate of approximately 18.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.40, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.40. In summary, fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start. By combining the power of product innovation and executional excellence, Adobe is driving consistent, profitable growth. We're delivering on our product roadmap, and we have the right strategy to monetize these innovations into the back half of the year and beyond. Adobe is incredibly well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trends that will shape the next decade. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan. We're the leader in three large and growing categories and have delivered groundbreaking innovation across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. We believe that AI augments human ingenuity and expands our addressable market opportunity. I'm proud of the pace and the responsible manner in which we have embraced and delivered generative AI capabilities across our product portfolio. As a result of our strategy and execution, we're confident in our ability to attract new users and deliver value to existing customers to drive growth and profitability.\nI'd like to thank our 30,000 employees for their continued dedication and unwavering focus on innovation and execution. It is particularly exciting to be named to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, Fortune's Most Admired Companies, and the JUST 100. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you are dialed in via the telephone and would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, please press star one to ask a question. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that everyone has the opportunity. You may press star one to rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess maybe this is for David or Dan. Obviously, you guys called out that new creative ARR was up more than 20% year-over-year when you exclude the pricing increases, which infers a pretty major pricing headwind that we're seeing right now. Can you all just try to parse out how that's going to play out over the year? I know, David, you mentioned ARR will go up in the back half of the year, but that it's just tough, I think, to reconcile what's going on in the business on a normalized basis and when we might see that sort of translate more into the metrics that everybody follows. Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, I'll start, and others can go ahead and add on. First of all, as we look at the book of the business, it is a strong start to the year with Q1 coming in at a high watermark with $432 million across the entire business. As we look specifically at Creative Cloud, I just want to sort of make sure everyone takes a step back and looks at our strategy to accelerate the business because I think the growth drivers here are very clear.\nWe are focused on expanding access to users with things like Express on mobile. We want to introduce new offers across the business with things like AI Assistant, and also existing capabilities for Firefly coming into our core Firefly, our core Photoshop and Illustrator, and flagship applications. We want to access new budget pools with the introduction of Firefly Services and GenStudio, as we talked about. The early signs, as you point out in Q1 results, are really suggesting that those growth drivers are taking hold. As you talked about normalizing for FY 2023, FY 2024 pricing actions, we grew the CC business about 20% year-over-year.\nOther key things to look at is that we set another record for new commercial subscriptions in Q1, and the business growth remains stable. If you look back at revenue, 12%. If you look forward at ARR, 12%. The stability and the diversity of the business is strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we have capabilities for Creative Cloud pricing with Firefly that have already started rolling out late last year, as we talked about, and will be incrementally rolling out throughout the year.\nWe're ramping Firefly Services and Express and Enterprise. As we talked about, we saw a very good beginning of that rollout toward the end of Q1. We also expect to see the second half ramping with Express Mobile and AI Assistant coming through. We have a lot of the back-end capabilities set up so that we can start monetizing these new features, which are still largely in beta, starting in Q3 and beyond. As it relates to pricing, it's what we've talked about in the past.\nWe had two pretty significant pricing actions that benefited FY 2023, the first one being the Acrobat price increases that we had put out with the new value that we had introduced with sign capabilities, and also a CC price increase that we introduced in FY 2022 that was rolling into FY 2023.Both of those are rolling off as we have now introduced the new pricing for CC with Firefly. Overall, the roll-off of the prior pricing is more significant than the new pricing that we've introduced.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Shantanu, the magnitude of the beat this quarter was roughly half the absolute beat you've had in past quarters, and the guide obviously lower for next quarter. I think everyone's asking, is this some type of AI headwind? Is this macro? Is this execution? Can you just comment on, and maybe it's none of these things, but can you just comment on what you think you're seeing in the current quarter?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah, happy to, Brent. I'll reiterate that as it relates to us taking our targets pretty seriously. I mean, when we guided to $1.9 billion for the year, we had factored in both, as David mentioned, what was likely to happen in the pricing and how that rolls off, as well as the product roadmap and when AI Assistant and Acrobat would be available, when Express, which is now in beta, would be available. I think it factored in all of those. I guess if you are looking at it from accomplishment, we look at it and say, hey, we did 410, I think last year. We did 432. If you look at the guide, we're on track as it relates to the 1.9 and to hopefully exceed that guide. From our perspective, it's playing out.\nMaybe the other color, Brent, that I would provide is given the desktop products are still in beta, there we look at value, and there we look at utilization. I think we gave you some numbers on the 6.5 billion generations that we're seeing, the really positive feedback that we're getting in Acrobat that continue to give us optimism associated with how that is. I think where there's tremendous interest, and where, if you look at it from an AI monetization, the two places that we're monetizing extremely in line with our expectations. The first is as it relates to the Creative Cloud pricing that we've rolled out. As you know, the generative packs are included for the most part in how people now buy Creative Cloud. That's rolling out as expected.\nThe second place where we are monetizing it is in the entire enterprise as it relates to content and GenStudio. I'm really happy about how that's monetizing it. That's a combination, Brent, of when we go into an enterprise for creation, whether we provide Creative Cloud or a combination of Express, what we are doing with asset management in AEM workflow, as well as Firefly services to enable people to do custom models as well as APIs. We're seeing way more monetization earlier, but again, very much in line with expected. I look at the quarter and I feel really good both about the product delivery, as well as the way monetization's turning out.\nI mean, it's clear, I guess, a little bit from sort of what we've seen that expectations were perhaps a little higher both in terms of what we would guide for Q2, but I'm really optimistic about what we have done.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks, Shantanu.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. My question's for Dan. You're not raising the full year guide, and I appreciate it's still early in the year, I think we're all hoping you can at least affirm it for us. You pushed out the enforcement of generative credit limits for some products beyond April that were originally expected sooner. What's the thinking behind this decision, and what are you seeing thus far in terms of credit consumption and purchasing patterns of those credit packs? Thanks.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks, Brad. I'll jump in on the first part and toss it over to David for the second. We're not updating the targets, the targets we provided for the full year. They're as of the December call. What we did share on the call was the material change that we saw in Q1 as a result of the Figma termination payment. We talked about the GAAP EPS impact. It rolls through Q1, and it'll certainly have an effect for the full year. It's $2.19 as a result of the billion-dollar payment. I think with that, I think you have everything you need relative to where we set our targets, but we're not going to be updating them on this call. Okay.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. I'm happy to add a little bit. Yeah. In terms of the timing of when we start enforcing credits, don't read anything into that other than right now, we are still very much in acquisition mode. We want to bring a lot of users in, we want to get them using the products as much as possible, we want them coming back and using it. One thing I do want to state, because I know there's a lot of energy around how do these credits play out over time, in the last few weeks, we've done a couple of sneaks that could also be instructive.\nLast month, we snuck a music composition where you can take any music track, you can give it a music type like hip hop or orchestral or whatever, and it will transform that initial track into this new type of music. Just this morning, we snuck our ability to do auto-dubbing and lip-syncing where you give it a video of someone talking and saying English, and then you can translate it automatically to French, Spanish, Portuguese, or whatever. As you can imagine, those actions will not take one credit.\nThose actions will be much more significant in terms of what they cost. Right now, Alex, the primary point is about proliferation and usage. We're going to be bringing in a lot more new capabilities throughout the tools that will drive more usage, and we're going to be bringing in more expensive capabilities as well. As we've talked about, you should start to see that ramp through the year, and we feel very comfortable with the adoption we're seeing. Just one last thing to call out, as we mentioned on the call, highest number of users using generative AI in Q1 ever. We are very excited about the trajectory.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nMaybe just to add a little bit more of how we're thinking about it as it relates to the monetization of AI. I think we're in early stages as it relates to experimentation. We're looking at both what the value utilization is, as well as experimentation. The value utilization is actually really positive for us. I think as it relates to the monetization and the experimentation, we have the generative packs, as you know, in Creative Cloud.\nI think you will see us more and more have that as part of the normal pricing, and look at pricing, because that's the way in which we want to continue to see people use it. I think in Acrobat, as you've seen, we are not actually using the generative packs. We're going to be using more of an AI Assistant model, which is a monthly model. As it relates to the enterprise, we have both the ability to do custom models, which depends on how much content that they are creating, as well as an API and metering.\nWe've rolled that out, and we've started to sell that as part of our GenStudio solution. I think it's fair to say, and I certainly monitor what everybody else in the industry is saying. The good news about this is the interface integration that we've done in all our apps, and the utilization. I think the experimentation will enable us to determine how we best attract the largest number of customers that we can who are new to Creative Cloud. We've talked about that as it relates to Firefly attracting new customers. Certainly, I think the number of Q1 commercial subscriptions was another record.\nWe're absolutely doing everything that we intended to experiment as we roll these out, Brad. I wanted to accentuate that as well.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you so much. Very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. David, couldn't help but notice you let off your prepared remarks section with the Document Cloud. Can you speak to the enthusiasm you're seeing on the document side? When we think about the mix of Digital Media growth for the year, should we expect it will continue to trend towards that document side, or is it more the second half where some of the creative enhancements start to layer on more meaningfully? We could start to see that shift back a bit. Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Happy to talk about that. We were very and continue to be very happy with the performance of Document Cloud. If you really look at trying to understand sort of how that plays out, Document Cloud is the growth is a combination of both our go-to-market efforts and our product innovation. On the go-to-market effort side, think about the fact that Reader continues to be a top of funnel for us, and we continue to see Reader monthly active user growth. The potential of people we can convert over to paid subscribers continues to grow.\nWe also talked about the fact that Acrobat Web has been a major contributor to our growth. We're seeing 70% year-over-year growth in terms of web MAU, and we crossed 100 million monthly active users for the first time on the website. Of course, we're doing a lot of work with product-led growth to drive journey users to some of that value that drives conversion. That's all we're doing on the go-to-market side. On the side of product innovation, our strategy over the last couple of years has been to make PDF the starting point of a workflow, right?\nThat's why we integrated Sign directly into that so that people could use their PDFs and start a transaction for their business. That continues to grow very nicely, and it's a great selling point for an integrated service. We also introduced link sharing a few years ago for commenting and reviewing with groups and teams. We saw that link sharing grow 300% year-over-year, so that's a huge point of value. It's also a huge point of viral growth. That's also what, when someone receives that, it's another opportunity for us to bring them into the value of the broader offering.\nYou can expect to see that with AI Assistant as well. Obviously, everyone's looking at AI Assistant in Acrobat. I certainly hope all of you are using it. It should make your lives more effective, not just for Insight. We think that there's a lot of opportunity for monetization of Insight for AI Assistant on our core base of Acrobat users, but also for the first time doing consumption-based value. The hundreds of millions of monthly active users of Reader will also be able to get access to AI Assistant and purchase an add-on pack there too.\nIt's a really broad base to look at how we monetize that. It's also the start of the ability to take your conversation and generate emails and presentations, and continue that process. The combination of all of that is a really potent combination of go-to-market efforts and product innovation. We continue to be bullish about this. The second part of your question, we are, as we've said multiple times on the call, very excited about all the innovation that's coming out that's just starting to ramp in terms of monetization and/or still in beta on the Creative Cloud side. We expect that to come out in Q3, and we'll start our monetization there.\nWe continue to feel very confident about the second half acceleration of Creative Cloud.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAppreciate all the details, sir. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays..\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for both David and Shantanu, clearly a lot of news around video creation using generative AI during the quarter, of course, with the announcement of Sora. Maybe the question for you folks is, can we just talk a little bit about how you think about the market impact that generative AI can have in the video editing market and how maybe Firefly can participate in that trend?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nSure, Saket. I mean, I'll start, and then David can add. I mean, firstly, I think the advances, whether it's in OpenAI or our own models that certainly David and I have the pleasure of looking at on a weekly basis, the advances are amazing because you have to, when you're thinking about video, solve some other fundamental problems like physics, right? I mean, if you have somebody walking on a street, how do you make sure that they don't go through a building or go through the floor?\nI think some of those video advancements that we have seen within Adobe have really addressed some of those hard problems. Big picture, though, video I think will be even more of an accelerant for editing applications. I mean, I think this notion that the next Oppenheimer will be done using a text-to-video prompt is just, it's not going to happen for decades. I think actually more so in video, there's going to be an accelerant for people saying, how do I get an on-ramp as it relates to using text-to-video and then edit that using our applications?\nI think I'm really particularly excited about what we can do with Premiere, as well as with After Effects, as it relates to video. Net-net, I would say, Saket the technology is impressive. We have our models. We have integrated into our interfaces. We're also partnering. I had a really great conversation with Jensen recently about what we can do as they are investing in video.\nCertainly, he would love to partner with us, and we're looking together to see how we can push the envelope on video as well using their models, whether it's Edify or NeMo. I think really early days, we're seeing a whole bunch. I hope, and David mentioned this, look at some of the lip-sync stuff that we've done as well, which allows you to auto-dub and translate into languages. We intentionally released a little bit of that demo. Really great advances, but net-net, video is going to be even more of a need for editing applications in order to truly take advantage of generative AI.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll just add a few things. First of all, as Shantanu mentioned, the research in the industry and certainly with Sora is very impressive and exciting. It's also very consistent with the models that we're developing. We think that there will be, as there was with imaging, multiple models that come out, including the Adobe model later this year. We should start to see a lot of innovation there, like we've seen in imaging.\nWe've already started to sneak a couple of things, as Shantanu talked about, but you will see text-to-video capabilities from us later this year. You'll also see it with transparency around the training data that we have, with toolability and controllability, and you'll see it integrated into our tools as well.\nNow, all of that said, I do want to be very clear with what Shantanu said, which is that we see the proliferation of video models to be a very good thing for Adobe. We're going to work with OpenAI around Sora. You're going to see us obviously developing our own model, and you're going to see others developing models. All of that creates a tailwind because the more people generate video clips, the more they need to edit that content, right?\nWhether it's Premiere, After Effects, or Express, they have to assemble those clips, color correct those clips, tone match, and enable transitions. We're excited about what we're building, but we're just as excited about the partnerships that we see with OpenAI and others coming down this path. If you take a step back, you should expect to see more from us in the weeks ahead with imaging, vector, and design, text effects, and in the months ahead with audio, video, and 3D. We're very excited about what all of this means, not just for the models, but also for our APIs and our tools.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSuper helpful. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mine is going to be more of a clarifying question because it's clear that from a number of comments, whether it's outperforming digital media ARR in the quarter, to accelerating creative ARR in the second half, to maybe doing better than 1.9 in the full year for digital media ARR, my question is very simple.\nCan you reiterate, not update, but reiterate the guide that you gave in December for digital media ARR in net new specifically for this year, and maybe put some takes around how we should think about, to the question earlier, the second half versus first half tailwind, headwind around pricing?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. We take our guide seriously. Q1 played out as expected. It was ahead of where we were last year. Our Q2 guide is ahead of where the guide was in Q2. We're talking about acceleration into the back half of the year. If I didn't feel like our full-year guide was achievable, we would have a different conversation. We're confident in the targets that we put out, their ability to meet them. If there's an opportunity to do better, we certainly will. We feel good about where we sit in the first half.\nAs we look forward into the second half, the momentum we see from an innovation standpoint, integrating into our products, what we see going from beta to GA, we feel good about the momentum into the second half.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Go ahead.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nUS Software research analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Dan, maybe I'll continue with this subject that Alex was getting at. I think what's tough about modeling AR R of late is it's very difficult to see the impact of the price actions. It feels like a black box to us. I'm wondering if you could help us get aligned for the second half and offer some qualitative color on the extent to which the prior period price actions roll off. Is that more of a Q3 or Q4 phenomenon? Is there any way you could help size that impact just to feel good about David's earlier comment about that roll-off being a big part of the second half ARR acceleration? Thank you.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. There were two pricing actions that we had taken in 2022. In May 2022, we pushed forward a pricing action. In October 2022, we pushed forward the Document Cloud line optimization where we integrated Sign. The one-year anniversary of those pricing actions from May 2022 and October 2022 will be behind us on the one-year anniversary. You will still see some Q3 impact from pricing actions in the year-ago period. Q4 will be a clean look for the company.\nAt least two months in Q4 will be a clean look. The actions that we're taking right now from both a pricing and a product standpoint on the creative side will be more apparent in the back half of the year into the end of the year.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nUS Software research analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. That's helpful.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nI think the other way I would look at it, honestly.\nSorry. Go ahead.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nGo ahead, David. Oh, Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, the way I would look at it in terms of the rhythm of the numbers and how you've seen sort of what transpired in 2023 and how we look at 2024 and the path to 1.9 and beyond, the way I would look at it is we're ahead in Q1. We're ahead in Q1. We're giving you all the reasons why we think there's more product coming, and more monetization coming in the rest of the year. That's what gives us the confidence associated with the targets. I guess there's this question of every quarter, do we reiterate targets, do we update targets, what does that mean? The way we've always thought of it is if there was a way, if we didn't have confidence, we would give you that.\nWe have confidence associated with the numbers, but we're not in the business of every quarter looking at every number. Let's go down one other number, which was the GAAP EPS. Certainly, there's an impact, as you know, in the GAAP EPS associated with what we did as it related to the Figma sort of transaction and therefore the impact to GAAP EPS in Q1. I think from my perspective, the quarter and the year is playing out just as we did. I feel more confident now than I did when we gave you our annual targets. I'll leave it at that.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nUS Software research analyst, UBS\n\nYep, you got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nElectronic Design Automatio Financial Analyst, Griffin Securities",
    "content2": "Thank you. Good evening. With respect to Firefly, it's obvious that you are significantly ramping up your investments there, at least judging by the number of relevant open positions you're looking to fill for Firefly development, many of which are seemingly fairly senior. Could you comment on your pipeline of being able to bring in the requisite amount of developmental capacity to support everything you're doing with Firefly and everything else that David in particular talked about?\nRelatedly on go-to-market, in the last few months, you've been opening up the aperture for sales positions globally. Could you comment on what the thinking is behind that? Again, whether the population is there for you to bring in to meet your sales headcount needs? Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Let me take the first one, then Anil can answer the question on sales. As it relates to the momentum we're seeing with Firefly, I think there are multiple layers of it. One is, obviously, we're seeing the quality of the models. We're seeing a differentiated approach as it relates to the training data, as it approaches contribution of assets from our community, and how we compensate those folks.\nThat's not just an Adobe perspective, but it's playing out, obviously, in enterprises as they look at what are the models that they can consider using for production workflows. We're the only one with the full suite of capabilities that they can do. It's a really unique position to be in. It's also being noticed by the research community, right?\nAs the community starts looking at places, as if I'm a PhD that wants to go work in a particular environment, I start to ask myself the question of which environment do I want to pick? A lot of people want to do AI in a responsible way. That has been a very, very good opportunity for us to bring in amazing talent. We are investing. We do believe that we have one of the best, if not the best, research labs around imaging, around video, around audio, around 3D. We're going to continue to attract that talent very quickly.\nWe've already talked about we have the broadest set of creative models for imaging, for vector, for design, for audio, for 3D, for video, for fonts, and text effects. This gives us a broad surface area to bring people in. That momentum that starts with people coming in has been great. The second part of this, too, is managing access to GPUs while maintaining our margins. We've been able to sort of manage our cost structure in a way that brings in this talent and gives them the necessary GPUs to do their best work.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nRegarding the sales positions in enterprise, you said in enterprise, we're in a strong position because this area of customer experience management remains a clear imperative for enterprise customers. Everybody is investing in this personalization, at scale, in the content supply chain. These help drive both growth and profitability. When you look at these areas, from an enterprise perspective, these are a must-have. This is not a need to have. That's helping us really attract the right kind of talent.\nWe just onboarded this week a VP of sales who had prior experience, a lot of experience with Cisco, Salesforce, etc. That's an example of we're really bringing on some excellent enterprise sales talent.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nI don't know if, Jay, you were asking for building your model or if you were looking for a job, but if you're interested in any of these positions, let us know.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nElectronic Design Automatio Financial Analyst, Griffin Securities\n\nMore the former.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nOkay.\n\nJonathan Voss\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nHey, operator. We're coming up on the hour. Let's try to squeeze in two more questions. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, yeah. Thank you very much. Looks like there's more trust in AI and Excel models than what you're actually saying qualitatively on this call. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to debunk this hypothesis that is going around that AI, it is generating videos and pictures, but the next step is it's going to do the actual editing and put out Premiere Pro user whatnot.\nThat is probably the existential threat that people are debating. I wanted you to see if we could take a shot at why that scenario is very unlikely, that right now it's about generation of images, and then your tools pick up where the generation stops and you do the processing, right? Help us understand why this can coexist with AI. That's a philosophical question. Dan, one for you.\nBesides the net new ARR that you've already reported on Creative and DM, what are the other indicators, such as new business bookings that you don't quantify necessarily, that you qualitatively saw in Q1 that makes you feel good about the year? Thank you so much.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nGreat. Maybe I'll take your first part. Dan, obviously, can take the second. As it relates to generated content, I'm going to sort of break it up into two parts. One is around the tooling and how you create the content, and the second is around automation associated with the content. I think if you take a step back, before we even get into either one of those, there is no question that there's a huge appetite because of personalization at scale, the need to engage users, the need to build your personal brand online.\nThat content is going to explode in terms of the amount of content being created. It's going to explode because of one of two things. The first is around the ability to create audio clips, video clips, images, vectors. These are things that get users started. It's great for ideation. You'll see in a few weeks that some of the incredible work the team has been doing around ideation on firefly.com. Once those things are created, they do flow into our tools for the production work and process.\nWe're clearly seeing a huge benefit from that because the more content that gets created, the more editing that's required. That's what's driving more commercial CC subscribers this quarter than any other Q1 before. That's the foundation of it. The second part of this, though, from an editing perspective, is the controllability and the editability of not just pixels, vectors, and timelines, but also the editability of the latent space itself. The latent space being the core model capabilities that actually generate the output. We have a lot of research that we've already started releasing, the first of which was Style Match.\nYou'll start to see more and more of that actually coming out at Summit and beyond. We are, in my mind, very, very clearly the leader in terms of creating models that can also be tooled on top of. That combination of the models getting better and the controllability of those models puts us in a remarkable position for that. We benefit from that. The second part, Cash, is around automation. As people are generating more content, you clearly need to be able to automate that content and how it's created. That's really where Firefly services come in.\nFirst, it's built on the strength of our Firefly models, safe for commercial use, integrated into our tools, but it also adds the ability to have custom models, so control what kinds of information or brand and content it's trained on for both brand styles and product replica. It's also part of an ecosystem of API services, not just generate something, which is a core part of it, like text to image, generative fill, or generative expand, but also process.\nOnce you generate some images through APIs and automation, you want to be able to remove the background, blur the depth, auto tone, and apply actions to that image. The last is you want to be able to assemble that for delivery. Firefly Services do not just generate something, but they let you have that entire ecosystem. You can embed that using low-code, no-code environments into your flows. We are already embedding it into GenStudio and all of the capabilities that we are shipping.\nI think the core part of this is that as more of this content creates, you need more toolability. The best models are going to be the models that are safe to use and have control built in from the ground up. I think we have the best controls of anyone in the industry. They need to be able to be done in an automated fashion that can embed into your workflow. I think all three of those vectors point to benefits for Adobe.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's very compelling.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nAs we think about the forward-looking, a couple of points I would turn to. You just think about cash flow in Q1. Strength of our cash flow, once you normalize for the billion-dollar termination payment, that's up 28% year-over-year. When you think about RPO, three-point acceleration sequentially, and when I break that up on deferred revenue, unbilled backlog, you saw that acceleration in each of those subcomponents.\nWhich, as you look through that acceleration, in the near term underscores the strength of the business, and it underscores the longer-term strength we have around the momentum of the business. When I think about individual product commentary, we've talked about it a lot on this call. You see record commercial subscriptions in the creative business in Q1. You see engagement going up on the products. Usage of Firefly capabilities in Photoshop was at an all-time high in Q1.\nExpress exports more than doubling with the introduction of Express Mobile in beta now, going to GA in the coming months. AI Assistant, Acrobat, same fact pattern. You can see that momentum as we look into the back half of the year. From an enterprise standpoint, the performance in the business was really, really superb in Q1, strongest Q1 ever in the enterprise. There is a lot of fundamental components that we are seeing around performance of the business that give us confidence as we look into the back half of the year.\n\nJonathan Voss\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nSuper. Thank you so much, Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys. I appreciate you squeezing me in. I'm going to take one last crack at this. Shantanu and team, we definitely hear your confidence in the business, but obviously, the stock market reaction is reflecting investors are worried about something. The two things that worry investors more so than anything are uncertainty, number one, and number two is back half ramps, right?\nI think what investors would really love to hear is Dan Durn actually say, we still expect to do $1.9 billion in net new digital media ARR and get some certainty there. Also, have a little bit more certainty or a little bit more explanation of what are the building blocks of that second-half ramp. Which products are expected to go GA? Are we including stuff like document intelligence?\nIs there new monetization avenues that we're putting into the back half? Or is there just some mechanism within sort of the Creative Cloud pricing that's going to turn on in the back half of the year? Any further specification in there I think would help sort of close the gap between your confidence and sort of the lack of confidence exhibited by the after-hour reaction.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nLet me tackle that, Keith, and maybe I'll just tackle it by taking a couple of the other questions as well, summarizing that, and ending with your question associated with the financial results. I think the first question that I hear across many folks is, hey, with the advent of AI and the increase in the number of models that people are seeing, whether they be image models or video models, does that mean that the number of seats, both for Adobe and in the world, do they increase or do they decrease?\nTo me, there's no question in my mind that when you talk about the models and interfaces that people will use to do creative content, the number of interfaces will increase. Adobe has to go leverage that massive opportunity, but big picture, models will only cause more opportunity for interfaces, and I think we're uniquely qualified to engage in that. That's the first one. The second one I would say is that, does Adobe innovate?\nWhen we do that, do we only leverage the Adobe model, or is there a way in which we can leverage every other model that exists out there? Much like we did with plugins with all of our creative applications, any other model that's out there, we will certainly provide ways to integrate that into our application. Anybody who's using our application benefits not just from our model creation, but from any other model creation that's out there.\nThe way we first started to execute against that is in the enterprise because for us, the enterprise and the ability to create custom models so people can tweak their models to be able to do things within Photoshop that are specific to a retailer or a financial service was where we focused. Long-term, certainly, as I've said with our partnerships, we will have the ability for Adobe in our interfaces to leverage any other model that's out there, which again further expands our opportunity.\nI think as we play out the year, when we gave our targets for the $1.9 billion in ARR and the $410 million in digital media ARR for Q1, it factored in both our product roadmap and how things would evolve in the year. All of the product roadmaps, we knew whether it was Acrobat, whether it was Express, whether it was Firefly, whether it was Creative Cloud, or whether it's GenStudio that brings all of these together. We knew the product roadmap which we're executing against. In the first half of the year, a lot of that was beta.\nIn the second half of the year, a lot of that's monetization. It's playing out as expected. If anything, I would say the excitement around that, and in particular, the enterprise, is faster than expected. I think our ability to monetize it not just through new seats, but also through these new Firefly services is expanded as it relates to what we are doing. As it relates to your question around financial results and the go-forward execution, we gave a Q1 target. We beat the Q1 target.\nThat gives us confidence that the financial target that we gave at the beginning of the year, we're ahead of that. That's how I'll play it out. You're right. You have to model it. You can look at last year's model and look at last year's model and say, hey, they got to $1.913 billion. If they're ahead, does that fundamentally change Adobe's thesis on why we get to $1.9 billion and beyond? In my mind, it doesn't. That's the way I would answer that question. We have to go execute against the opportunity that we have.\nI look forward to those who are at Summit. I'm sure we'll have a little bit more conversation. Q1 was a strong start. It was a strong start against product execution. It was a strong start against the financial metrics that we outlined. We're going to go do it again, Keith. That's how I would answer your question. Thank you all for joining. With that, I'll hand it back to Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Voss\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nAll right. Thanks, everybody. I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. This concludes the call. We look forward to seeing you at Summit."

Reconciliations between the two are available in our earnings release and on Adobe's IR website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was our first-ever $5 billion quarter, a new record for the company. Adobe achieved revenue of $5.05 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.27, representing 28% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively. Q4 was the culmination of another record year for Adobe, achieving $19.41 billion in revenue, which represents 13% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2023 was $11.82, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $16.07, both representing 17% year-over-year growth. We exited the year with $17.22 billion in RPO. Our strong performance reflects the mission-critical role our products play in a digital-first world: incredible product innovation, and exceptional execution.\nAdobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of digital experiences, starting with the moment of inspiration to the creation and development of content and media, to the personalized delivery and activation across every channel. Adobe's mission of changing the world through personalized digital experiences, and our delivery of foundational technology platforms, set us up for the next decade of growth. We take pride in being one of the most inventive, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We believe that every massive technology shift offers generational opportunities to deliver new products and solutions to an ever-expanding set of customers. AI and generative AI is one such opportunity, and we have articulated how we intend to invest and differentiate across data, models, and interfaces.\nWe have delivered against this strategy and are pleased that a number of our groundbreaking innovations, including our Firefly models and integrations across Creative Cloud, Liquid Mode and integrations across Document Cloud, and AI services in our real-time customer data platform and integrations in Experience Cloud, are now seeing tremendous usage by customers. We remain excited about the strategic opportunity with Figma to jointly advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. We continue to engage with the European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK, and the US Department of Justice as they conduct their regulatory reviews. The EC has provided a preliminary statement of objections, and the CMA has issued provisional findings of competition concerns. We strongly disagree with these findings and are responding to the respective regulators.\nAs per their current timelines, the EC's decision deadline is 5 February 2024, and the CMA's is 25 February 2024. While the DOJ does not have a formal timeline to decide whether to bring a complaint, we expect a decision soon. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q4, we achieved net new digital media ARR of $569 million and revenue of $3.72 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our creative and document businesses. Starting with Creative Cloud, global demand for content is accelerating and continues to be a tailwind for the business. Creative Cloud remains the creativity platform of choice for creators across imaging, photography, design, video, web, animation, and 3D. Our rapid pace of product and AI model innovation is empowering a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small business owners, and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before. We were thrilled to come together in person with thousands of creators at Adobe MAX in Los Angeles and at our MAX event in Tokyo, with millions more from our community engaging with us online.\nWe reached a record 300 million social interactions in the month following MAX. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud, achieving $3 billion in revenue, which grew 14% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $398 million. Business highlights include strong digital traffic resulting from product innovation, social engagement, and our continued product-led growth efforts, which drove record new commercial subscriptions in the quarter. The general availability of our generative AI Firefly models and their integrations across Creative Cloud drove tremendous customer excitement with over 4.5 billion generations since launch in March. The release of three new Firefly models: Firefly Image 2 model, Firefly Vector model, and Firefly Design model, offering highly differentiated levels of control with effects, photo settings, and generative match. We also introduced generative credits as part of our Creative Cloud subscription plans.\nThe general availability of Photoshop Generative Fill and Generative Expand, which are seeing record adoption, they're already among the most used features in the product. Advances in Adobe Illustrator with the introduction of Text to Vector Beta, enabling users to generate icons, scenes, subjects, patterns, and gradients. Adobe Premiere Pro advances include a significant performance improvement in the timeline for faster and smoother editing, new color preferences, and improved tone mapping. Premiere Pro is now natively integrated with Frame.io, offering faster content sharing and collaboration. The combination of Adobe Express and Firefly is enabling everyone from creative pros to beginners to quickly move from ideation to task-based workflows in Express, dramatically expanding our reach and widening our top-of-funnel.\nThe family of generative capabilities across Express, including text-to-image, text effects, text-to-template, and generative fill, are driving adoption of Express and making it even faster and more fun for users of all skill levels. Express now comes pre-installed on all new Chromebooks, making it accessible to students, educators, and anyone using Chrome OS. Continued strength in Adobe Stock, which had its best year ever, was driven by accelerating demand for high-quality image, vector, video, and 3D content. Creative Cloud, Express, and Firefly integrations with Adobe Gen Studio are enabling ideation, creation, and stakeholder collaboration as part of their overall content supply chain. Strong mid-market and enterprise adoption is driven by upsell to Creative Cloud offerings with Firefly. Key customer wins include CyberAgent, Deloitte, Discovery Communications, Nexstar Media, Pepsi, Publicis, and the United Nations. We are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the creative business following a year of unprecedented innovation.\nCustomer excitement around Firefly integrations across our applications has been great to see, with community engagement, social interactions, and creative marketing campaigns driving organic brand search volume, traffic, and record demand. While we started rolling out new Creative Cloud pricing in select geographies in November, the primary driver of growth continues to be new paid subscriptions across our routes to market. We are excited to build on this momentum as we enter FY 2024. Now turning to Document Cloud, digital documents are essential enablers of our personal and professional lives. Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents, powering all common document actions, including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning, and signing. Document Cloud innovations are advancing accessibility, comprehension, productivity, automation, and security in document workflows across web, desktop, and mobile. In Q4, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $721 million, growing 17% year-over-year.\nWe added a record $171 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, with ending ARR growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency. Business highlights include Acrobat web growth, which continues to be an incredible source of customer acquisition, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year. A surge in usage of link sharing for stakeholder collaboration around PDF files, which increased 400% year-over-year, creating a viral growth loop that is bringing tens of millions of users into the Acrobat ecosystem. This is a great example of how we are scaling our PLG motions. Strong demand for Acrobat on mobile, with MAU surpassing 100 million users in Q4. Liquid Mode has now served over 1 billion files to customers, demonstrating how indispensable this technology has become on mobile devices. Adobe Acrobat to Express workflows, making it even easier to import, edit, and enhance documents to create visually stunning PDFs.\nKey enterprise customer wins include Alshaya, Bank of America, Department of Veterans Affairs, Mastercard, State Farm Auto Insurance, and Volkswagen. Much like the creative business, we expect generative AI to deliver additional value and attract new customers to Document Cloud. Acrobat's generative AI capabilities, which will enable new creation, comprehension, and collaboration functionality, have already been rolled out in a private beta. We expect to release this in a public beta in the coming months. It's been an extraordinary year for the digital media business, with the introduction of hundreds of transformative innovations that are reshaping the future of creativity, productivity, and digital experiences. Capping this year's many accolades, Time Magazine recognized Adobe Liquid Mode, Photoshop Generative Fill, and Generative Expand among the best inventions of 2023. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. Digital experiences are indispensable for every business in every category, enabling companies of all sizes to engage and transact with customers around the world. Adobe's holiday shopping report, which analyzes trillions of data points, found that both Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales hit record highs of $9.8 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, jumping 7.5% and 9.6% from last year. We predict that holiday 2023 spend will exceed $221 billion in the US alone. Adobe Experience Cloud is optimally positioned to capitalize on this massive global opportunity. Companies across B2C and B2B are turning to Adobe Experience Cloud as the platform to accelerate experience-led growth. Our leading solutions, spanning data insights and audiences, content and commerce, customer journeys, and marketing workflow, empower businesses to drive customer demand, engagement, and growth while simultaneously delivering productivity gains.\nOur comprehensive set of applications, including real-time CDP, are built natively on our highly differentiated Adobe Experience Platform, providing companies with a unified profile of each of their customers to deliver personalized, real-time experiences at scale. Generative AI accelerates our pace of innovation across the Experience Cloud portfolio, enabling us to build on our capabilities to deliver personalized digital experiences. Our efforts are focused in three areas. One, augmenting our applications with an AI assistant that significantly enhances productivity for current users, and provides an intuitive conversational interface to enable more knowledge workers to use our products. Two, reimagining existing Experience Cloud applications, like we did with Adobe Experience Manager. Three, developing entirely new solutions built for the age of generative AI, like Adobe Gen Studio.\nIn Q4, we continue to drive strong growth in the Experience Cloud business across our enterprise and mid-market customers, achieving $1.27 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.12 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Business highlights include strong momentum with Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, inclusive of Real-time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics. AEP had its first $100 million quarter of net new business in Q4 and exited the year with a greater than $700 million annualized book of business. Release of Adobe Gen Studio, an end-to-end solution that brings together best-in-class applications across Creative Cloud, Express, and Experience Cloud, with Firefly generative AI at the core to help brands meet the rising demand for content. Gen Studio provides a comprehensive offering spanning content ideation, creation, production, and activation.\nWe are seeing tremendous interest in Gen Studio from brands like Henkel, Pepsi, and Verizon, and agencies like Publicis, Omnicom, and Avast as they look to accelerate and optimize their content supply chains. Reimagine customer experiences with the all-new Adobe Experience Manager sites that enable businesses and developers to quickly test and optimize web content, deliver fastest possible page load times, and maximize SEO rankings, Lighthouse scores, and conversion. Adobe was recognized as a leader in over 25 industry analyst reports this year, including the Gartner Magic Quadrants for digital experience platforms, B2B marketing automation platforms, and multi-channel marketing hubs. In the Forrester Wave for digital experience platforms, which was published last week, Adobe received the highest scores for strategy. Key customer wins include Alshaya, Coca-Cola, EY, IBM, Marriott, Riyadh Air, Santander Brazil, Sony, Southern Graphics, Unilever, Vanguard, and Verizon.\nIn our conversations with these and other customers around the world, C-level executives are continuing to prioritize experience-led growth as a critical business imperative despite ongoing budget scrutiny. Adobe Experience Cloud is well-positioned to keep winning with innovative products that power end-to-end customer experiences and enable companies to simultaneously drive growth and profitability. We are looking forward to continuing our leadership and momentum into 2024. I'll now pass it to Dan.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and FY 2023 results. What a year 2023 was. Fueled by a deep understanding of our customers, product innovation, and outstanding execution, we delivered strong financial results and world-class margins, positioning the company for years of continued growth. In FY 2023, Adobe achieved record revenue of $19.41 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 13% growth in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the year was $11.82, and non-GAAP EPS was $16.07, each growing 17% year-over-year. FY 2023 business and financial highlights included digital media revenue of $14.22 billion, net new digital media ARR of $1.91 billion, digital experience revenue of $4.89 billion, cash flows from operations of $7.3 billion, RPO of $17.22 billion exiting the year, and repurchasing approximately 11.5 million shares of our stock during the year at a cost of $4.63 billion.\nIn the fourth quarter of FY 2023, Adobe achieved revenue of $5.05 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $3.23, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $4.27, growing 28% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Q4 business and financial highlights included digital media revenue of $3.72 billion, net new digital media ARR of $569 million, digital experience revenue of $1.27 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.6 billion, adding approximately $1.5 billion to RPO in the quarter, our highest sequential quarterly increase ever, and repurchasing approximately $1.8 million shares of our stock. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $3.72 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency.\nOur net new ARR in Q4 was $569 million, which was a quarterly record in constant currency, and we exited the quarter with $15.17 billion of digital media ARR. We achieved creative revenue of $3 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency, and we added $398 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter. Driving this performance was strong customer acquisition throughout the quarter, as well as strength during the peak holiday shopping weeks.\nFourth quarter creative growth drivers included individual subscriber growth fueled by targeted campaigns and strong web traffic, a strong quarter for Creative Cloud all-app subscriptions across customer segments and geographies with particular strength in emerging markets, sales of CC single apps, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings, continued growth of our Frame IO offering, and Adobe Stock, which capped off its best year ever in terms of net new ARR, customer demand and education driven by back-to-school purchasing, as well as migrations to full-priced offerings by graduating students entering the workforce, and typical Q4 strength in the enterprise, including significant upsell of our new Firefly and Express offerings. Adobe achieved document cloud revenue of $721 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth or 17% in constant currency. We added a record $171 million of net new document cloud ARR in the quarter.\nFourth quarter document cloud growth drivers included Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments, routes to market, and geographies, continued strength of our free-to-paid funnels, including Reader on the Desktop and Acrobat Web, strong performance of our collaboration services, including PDF link sharing and sign, which are virally bringing new users to the Acrobat ecosystem, an outstanding quarter for Acrobat Mobile as a result of increased proliferation, usage, and conversion, and year-end seasonal strength in SMB and enterprise. Turning to our digital experience segment, in Q4, we achieved revenue of $1.27 billion, growing 10% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. We achieved subscription revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth.\nFourth quarter digital experience growth drivers included strong year-end bookings across solutions with particular strength in North America, continued success closing multi-solution transformational deals with large enterprises, momentum with AEP and native applications, with the FY 2023 exiting book of business growing greater than 60% year-over-year, strong net dollar retention for early adopters of AEP, demonstrating the value enterprises are realizing from our real-time data platform and integrated offerings, and strength across our data and insights, content, and workfront solutions, and growing customer interest and pipeline for our new Gen Studio solution. We drove world-class operating margins in Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023 by making disciplined investments in R&D, marketing, and sales, and we're pleased that we grew EPS faster than revenue. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations.\nRPO exiting the quarter was $17.22 billion, growing 13% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $7.84 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.6 billion after making a previously discussed payment in the quarter of $826 million of U.S. federal taxes that we deferred from the second and third quarters of FY 2023. In Q4, we entered into a $1 billion share purchase agreement, and we currently have $2.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end. FX rate changes between December of 2022 and this year have resulted in a $160 million increase to digital media ARR balance entering FY 2024, which is now $15.33 billion and is reflected in our updated investor data sheet.\nFactoring in the momentum across our businesses and current expectations for the macroeconomic and foreign exchange environments, for FY 2024, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of $21.30 to 21.50 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, digital media segment revenue of $15.75 to 15.85 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $5.275 to 5.375 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $4.75 to 4.80 billion, tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $13.45 to 13.85, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $17.60 to 18. As a reminder, and as is customary, these targets do not reflect our planned acquisition of Figma.\nWe expect normal seasonality throughout the year, with a seasonal step down for new business into the first quarter, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, typical Q3 summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. We expect our cash tax rate to improve sequentially in FY 2024 by two percentage points as the amortization of previously capitalized R&D increases our deductions next year for tax purposes, benefiting our operating cash flows next year.\nFor Q1, FY 2024, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.10 to 5.15 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, digital media segment revenue of $3.77 to 3.80 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $1.27 to 1.29 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $1.14 to 1.16 billion, tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $3.35 to 3.40, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.35 to 4.40. While the implied operating margin for Q1 is up sequentially, we expect a typical seasonal margin step down starting in Q2 as a result of the annual merit increases and disciplined investments to drive growth. In summary, I couldn't be prouder of the company's performance in FY 2023 and the momentum we're carrying into 2024 across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud.\nOur strategy, scale, speed of execution, and profitability position us for years of sustained success. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan. In addition to our financial accomplishments, we are proud to once again be recognized for our industry leadership. Content credentials and Adobe's approach to responsible AI were recognized by Fast Company as one of the year's breakthrough innovations. We were again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Glassdoor listed Adobe as one of the best places to work, and Interbrand ranked us in the top 20 best global brands as a rising brand for the eighth year in a row. Digital remains a massive tailwind as content demand and consumption continues to grow, and businesses of all sizes are focused on transforming their customer experiences. Adobe is incredibly well-positioned to lead and capitalize on this opportunity, thanks to our innovative roadmap, expanding global customer base, strong brand, and the best employees in the world.\nOur fiscal 24 financial targets reflect our confidence in continuing to drive strong top-line growth and world-class profitability. I am more certain than ever that Adobe's best days are ahead of us. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow the signal to reach our equipment. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, press star one to ask a question. We'll pause for just a moment to assemble the queue. We'll take our first question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter and happy holidays. Shantanu and team, I'm wondering, going into 2024, it definitely feels like the economy is in stable footing, and in general, the software metrics are all improving as this year unfolded. And very different from going from '22 to '23. Yet your DM new ARR guidance is about the same as how you started last year, but you got the benefit of generative AI, tailwinds from the economy, you got pricing and Firefly. Can you just help us understand if you isolate for those factors what has gone into your guidance? Because it seems like if we exclude the optionalities that you have, including the tailwinds in the economy, that that guidance looks like it's very conservative. And maybe that's the right thing to do, but just wanted to understand your thought process. Thank you so much.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks, Kash. I mean, certainly really thrilled with what a phenomenal year we had across all aspects of the business, whether it was the $5 billion quarter, $5 billion book of business now in DX exiting, and certainly digital media ARR performance. Now, if you reflect, I mean, you talked about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of '23 and '24. If you recall, we actually had guided to $16.50 first, then we upped it, as you know, to $17.50 and ended with $19.13. And so, to your point, on the execution front, we've delivered some great innovative products. We've expanded the customer base with new products like Express and Firefly. We're certainly focused on surfaces and making sure all of our flagship products are available across all surfaces.\nAnd so we do have multiple growth drivers, to your point, and we are focused on monetizing the opportunity. I mean, I would say we take our guide very seriously. The other way of looking at it, Kash, is it's our highest annual guide ever in terms of what the guide we've issued. It's our highest Q1 guide ever, and we want to go, again, execute against this large opportunity and have another record year. So we're feeling good. The momentum is certainly there in the business, but we take our guidance at this point of the year very seriously.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much and happy holidays. All the best for 2024.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks. Happy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. I think this is in a similar vein to what Kash was trying to get at, but maybe a little bit more focused on Q4 in particular. When we look at the digital media net new ARR ads in Q4, it looks like you had a very, very strong Document Cloud, record quarter, like you were saying, really strong year-on-year growth in those net ads. Creative Cloud, where we actually saw a price increase and we had all the excitement on Firefly, that was actually down on a year-on-year basis. And this is the first time since 2018 we've seen Creative Cloud net new ARR below $400 million. And I think that's the surprise for investors, or the negative surprise for investors that we're trying to figure out.\nWas there something dragging the Creative Cloud side of the equation this year, or a tough comp from last year, or something that explains why the price increases and all the positive momentum and innovation out of Adobe Max isn't translating into net new ARR growth for Creative Cloud in particular?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, happy to take that, Keith, David here. So first of all, as you mentioned in the DME business, we're really excited about the results for '24, over $1.9 billion in net new ARR, obviously well above the guide. We see an expanding base of customers and a lot of momentum coming from GenAI, as you noted. As part of this, what we delivered in Q4 was net new ARR, was a record net new ARR in constant currency. Now, specific to your question on Creative Cloud momentum and how to interpret the numbers that you see there, underlying all this is very strong momentum because we delivered a record Creative Cloud new commercial subscriptions number in the year.\nSo that is really the foundation and the base of customers coming in and really benefiting from not just what we get in this quarter, but also how we build on that going forward. So it really sets us up well for FY 2024. As you look at the numbers for Creative Cloud ARR, net new ARR in the quarter, you have to look at it relative to Q4 FY 2023 relative to Q4 FY 2022, as you mentioned. You need to consider that FY 2022 had two pricing actions that accrued to Creative Cloud that are much lower now in Q4 FY 2023. So if you normalize for the impact of the pricing that rolled off and the pricing that came on, Creative Cloud net new ARR in Q4 grew on a constant currency basis.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nAnd Keith, just to punctuate the two points that David said, first, it was a record for Creative ARR as it related to subscriptions in Q4 of 2023, and Creative ARR would have grown if you had backed out the pricing. So the business continues to be extremely healthy, to your point.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe looking at next year, as we look at how much of the renewal base in Creative Cloud is potentially up for that type of the pricing uplift, and as we look at Acrobat, specifically the AI functionality that you're releasing into public beta, how should we think about the tailwind to both Creative Cloud from pricing and to Document Cloud specifically from an AI product monetization perspective for '24, for calendar '24?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, happy to take that, Alex. A lot packed into that question, so let me try to tease it apart. Let me first start with the question around FY 2024 and the impact of pricing. Before we jump straight into that, I do want to take a bit of a step back and just remind everyone that digital media ARR is a mix of a few things: new subscriptions, which, as I mentioned, we had a record number of new subscriptions in Q4; upsell and cross-sell, which is transitioning people to higher plans from the plan that they're on; and then lastly, offer optimization. As you've noted, in the last couple of years, we've really been broadening the number of offers we have all the way down from free price points to the all-apps price points.\nBut even beyond that, we now have capabilities to sell add-ons to all apps as well. And of course, all of this does include the pricing increases that you had mentioned where we've added more value. I do want to just stress, because I know there's a lot of attention on the pricing impact, that we always have seen and continue to believe that the primary growth driver for ARR will be new subscriptions in '24. So that's why we're so focused on the top-of-funnel and new customer acquisition. But specific to your question on pricing, you need to consider a few things. First, our recently announced pricing changes will impact less than half the Creative Cloud base. So that was a very specific question you asked. Hopefully, that gives you the answer.\nBut it also leaves us the opportunity to price in new value in the years ahead as we move forward. Second, the impact will be more visible in net new ARR in the back half of FY 2024 as we lap the previous pricing actions that I was talking to Keith about from last year and as we roll out the pricing over the next few quarters. So the second half of FY 2024, we'll see more visibility into the benefits of that to net new ARR. Third, given that we're rolling out these prices across plans and across geos incrementally over the year, the benefit to ARR will actually be spread across FY 2024 and FY 2025. And fourth, if you really want to sort of sharpen your pencils, the pricing impact on ARR in '24 is actually lower than the pricing impact was in '23 to Creative Cloud.\nSo hopefully, that gives you a sense. But again, it comes back to this is why we're so excited about the momentum we're seeing in new subscriptions, which really bodes well for the business this year and in the long-term. Hopefully, that gives you a pretty good sense on that. And then really quickly on Document Cloud, we're thrilled with the performance of Document Cloud. A lot of that comes down to our core strategy, which has been around integrating the desktop, the web, and mobile into a single ecosystem and really driving the monthly active usage of Document Cloud up through all of the product-led growth motions we have and converting people on the back end of that.\nWhat we're really excited about as we bring the AI assistant to market, which, by the way, as I mentioned, is now in private beta, expected to come out in the next few months as a public beta and then GA later in the year. But what we're really excited about there is being able to not just service the paid Acrobat base with that, but also start to bring that to the free reader base. So lots of opportunity and excitement for the year ahead for Doc Cloud as well.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you for the very fine-pointed answer.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nNo problem.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks. And congrats on the quarter and happy holidays. David, I guess I'll go back to you again. In the commentary, you all talked about enterprise strength and specifically upselling of Firefly and Express and your enterprise customer base. Can you just give us some more, I guess, qualitative color on what those discussions are like? Is this part of the reason you're seeing sort of an uptick in new subscriptions in the enterprise in particular? And then on Express, can you just talk again about sort of what you're seeing in terms of leading indicators of that being an enterprise product that can continue to expand into fiscal '24? Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start, and then Anil can add because this does cross over our two businesses. So with Firefly and Express, very excited about the momentum that we continue to see. You heard that we crossed $4.5 billion generations now. So we continue to see really, really strong adoption and usage of it, partially as a standalone business, but also integrated into our Photoshop and Illustrator and these existing workflows. And we're starting to see a lot of interest, not just in the context of using it as part of the existing products, but also using it as part of the ecosystem within enterprises.\nSo we've been working with a number of customers to not just enable them with Firefly, which is the predominance of the growth that we're seeing in Q4 for enterprise adoption, but also have a number of pilot customers already engaged around custom model extensions so that they can bring their own assets and their own content into what Firefly generates. Second, we're also enabling the ability to expose it through APIs so they can build it into their existing workflows. And third, we're, of course, connecting it and tying it all into Adobe Express, which now also has its own Firefly and additional capabilities like things so that you can not just sort of create content using Firefly, but then start to assemble it, start to schedule social posts around it, start to do multi-language translations. Those are all features that are already in there.\nThen create a stakeholder workflow from people working in Photoshop to the marketers that are trying to post externally. So that's where things get very interesting and exciting in terms of the connection we have with GenStudio and everything that Anil's doing.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nJust building on that, GenStudio, since we announced it at Max, we've had a tremendous amount of interest, both from enterprise customers like Henkel and Pepsi and Verizon, as well as a number of the agencies as well. And primarily, it goes back to what we discussed at Summit. The demand for content is expected to grow 5x over the next couple of years. And every brand in the world is looking at, \"Hey, how can we speed up the production of quality on-brand content?\nHow can we let a number of other people in marketing, other areas of the company create their own content according to the enterprise standards?\" And the combination of what we have in the digital experience portfolio, like Adobe Experience Manager and assets, as well as what we have in the Creative Cloud, especially around Express and Creative Cloud, really lets enterprises get that kind of agility and the cost-effectiveness of producing content at scale. So that's what we're seeing, and we're seeing a tremendous amount of interest for that.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nAnd maybe I'll just add a little bit to that, Kirk. I mean, I think the exciting thing about what people are doing is they're standardizing on Firefly and the fact that we have responsible generations for the entire enterprise. So the interest level has been around, \"How do we standardize that for all of the image or vector or other generations that they want to do for all the knowledge workers in the enterprise?\" So really good adoption of Firefly.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. I'd love to ask about a different subject, and that's the Creative Express product now that it's being sold into the enterprise. Wondering if you could offer some color on the adoption ramp, the competitiveness versus Canva, and whether your plans around driving Express revenues versus driving user adoption have changed at all. Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nGreat. Yeah, happy to take that. Express is off to a great start. As you remember, we went general availability in August with the latest version of it. It's been getting a lot of very, very positive reaction response. Frankly, since then in Q4, too, we've added a ton of new innovation. Firefly integration started with text-to-image and text effects, but we also added text-to-template that'll create a fully formed template for you and generative fill so you can iteratively change things on the fly. We now let you draw and paint on the canvas. We've given users much more video support. We've really built an incredible best-of-breed PDF support and workflow with Acrobat in there as well. Some of the other things that now start to bleed into the enterprise also, we have integrated social workflows so that people can schedule their posts.\nWe've enabled people to do auto translation so you can post to multiple geographies and languages. We've opened up our ecosystem for partner plugins, and we have now over 50 extensions. We've added enterprise features like Adobe Experience Manager integration and template locking so that the core brand police in an organization can manage and make sure that their brand elements that they don't want changing are locked when you disseminate this more broadly. What we've seen is really, I think, some very exciting broad-based benefits from this. One is we've seen new trialists coming in, growing very quickly after this launch, which is exciting to see. We've seen education users starting to adopt this very quickly as well. The Creative Cloud paid base has been coming on and growing very quickly in terms of their usage. Then enterprise, as we talked about, from a usage perspective.\nAnd again, Express is a core part of how Anil and team are now selling GenStudio. And the last thing is this is just setting up the momentum for the year to come. We have a mobile release coming out, which will be very exciting for users to be able to use this on the go. We have thousands of people already using that beta. We announced our Chromebooks partnership. So anyone that buys a new Chromebook is going to have this. We have partnerships with folks like Wix for their workflows. We're going to be doing deeper integrations into Acrobat. So we're very excited about where this goes. That is a long way to answer a very simple question. We want a lot of people using this. So our primary focus continues to be around broadening the top-of-funnel.\nOf course, as part of that, we are constantly and continually, as I mentioned, journeying people for upsell and cross-sell opportunities to the paid plan and over to Creative Cloud and other products. But our primary focus continues to be adoption and broad proliferation.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. This is for Dan or maybe Anil. As we think about the momentum within the DX business, it's great to hear things like the 60% increase in your AEP and native apps book of business, the strong NIF dollar retention, and you talked about overall strong year-end bookings. But what is it maybe about the pipeline ahead, bookings conversion, or perhaps other factors that account for the degree of VSEL that you're guiding for into next year? Thanks.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks, Brad. We are really excited about this massive multi-year opportunity. If we look at any enterprise customers around the world, everybody recognizes the long-term imperative of transforming their customer experiences. And we're seeing that in these transformational deals that we talked about. As you mentioned, for example, with the AEP, our first 100 million net new business quarter and ending with over 700 million in our annualized book of business. With that said, it's definitely we're seeing the macroeconomic impact, just like other enterprise software companies are. Every customer looks at the total cost of deploying the software and then what it would take to get the payback and ROI. And as a result, there's definitely some scrutiny and caution there. But that said, if we look at going into next year, we do see the pipeline across both our industry verticals as well as our mid-market customers.\nAnd we continue to be the leader in the market, and we get that recognition from both analysts and customers.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nDan, if you could just review the broader assumptions in your guide. I think there's still a little concern from the street in terms of where you're guiding relative to where the street was at. And maybe just tying in Shantanu to the guide, if you could just give us your top line view of, do you feel like the environment's improving? Do you think it's just stabilizing? Just any thoughts in terms from a high level what you think is happening as we go into next year?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question, Brent. When we take a look at the guide, if we think about where we're at at this point in time as we're looking forward in FY 2024, clearly we see a lot of momentum in the business. The company's engine of innovation has been incredibly strong, and you see the strong financial performance of the company that's both from a top-line standpoint as well as profitability and cash flow standpoint. So clearly, a lot of momentum around the business. As I think about where we sit today, we printed a 46.4% operating margin. As we look forward into next year, we take into account everything we can see. As Shantanu said, we take the guidance seriously, and we set expectations in a prudent way. There's an opportunity to do better than the expectations that we set.\nClearly, the company's going to be driving towards that. As we think about the engine of innovation, we think the pipeline is strong. We're going to continue to invest in the drivers of growth. This company's going to orient towards growth. When I think about the investment profile, not only are we going to be disciplined, but we're going to continue to invest in those drivers of growth on the DX side. Anil talked about AEP and apps, strong book of business, strong growth. We're laying the groundwork in content supply chain with the GenStudio solution, scaling that motion and engaging with customers to go from ideation to creation to activation, delivering new technologies, products, AEM sites, incorporating intelligence into those products. On the DME side, you can see it across the portfolio, AI Assistant and Acrobat. It's in private beta.\nIt's going to be in public beta in the coming months. You look at Firefly, Express, natively and deeply integrating these technologies throughout the product portfolio. There is going to be continual investment as it relates to that innovation. As you think about the momentum exiting this year, and as you think about the guide into Q1, you can see that momentum continuing. You got operating margin up a little bit. Throughout the year, as we said at our FA day and the last year's earnings call, you can see a mid-40s expectation around operating margin for the company as we drive this investment cycle, as we drive leadership in our core markets and our key catalyst in the trends that are shaping those markets.\nSo again, taking a step back, it nets into account the macro that Anil talked about, everything we see from a core business standpoint and the investment profile that we're going to drive to lead. If there's an opportunity to do better than where we set those expectations, we're certainly going to do it.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nAnd maybe just to add to that, Brett, since you asked first, let me clarify. There's nothing as it relates to the economic indicators that we saw, anything that would give us pause for concern. So let me start off by saying that. I think at our investor meeting, we told you that we would expect a strong quarter. I think you would acknowledge we posted some really strong numbers, and the momentum continues. And I think as it relates to Creative Cloud, it's going to be driven by new customer acquisition, which is the engine that's driven the business. And maybe perhaps the sell side looked at some of the pricing and put more of that in '24 than in '24 and '25, and that'll spread out. And perhaps they put a little bit more in what percentage of the base that impacts.\nFrom my perspective, the good news about Creative is it's being driven by massive new adoption into the platform. On Document Cloud, really strong results. I think as Dan said, as we put the AI pack on there as well, that should help fuel more adoption and digital experience. I mean, I know that Brad also asked that question. I mean, it's great to see the adoption of AEP and apps. I mean, that is clearly the future of digital experiences, driving $100 million quarter, the $700 million in the annualized book of business, which I think will reflect the next generation customer experience architecture. We're feeling positive, and we're going to go execute against that, Brent. Nothing that we see on the horizon would tell us either from the economic or competition that we're not poised to have another great year and profitability as well.\nI mean, look at the numbers that we posted both in terms of Q4 as well as for fiscal 2024. And that does not in any way mean that we're not going to invest in all of the cloud and the foundation models. So I feel really good.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe",
    "content2": "Just one thing to add, Brent. If we were here a year ago, the expectations going into the year where FX was going to be a pretty decent headwind to the performance. You see that in the way we've reported our results and then compare it to a constant currency basis. We started with a pretty decent spread between the as-reported numbers and constant currency in Q1. By the time we got to Q4, you saw that spread compress. As I look forward into FY 2024, it's more of a neutral footing to maybe a slight headwind. Too early to really call it with precision, but I see that setup being slightly different and maybe just a slight headwind versus what we were seeing a year ago.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks for the call.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. You noted the strength in RPO in the quarter, including the record sequential increase. Could you talk about how you're thinking about RPO for fiscal '24? Would you expect it to continue to be able to outgrow revenue growth by several points as you did in fiscal '23? And perhaps talk about the ingredients that will continue to drive RPO, either by segment or any other considerations that you'd like to talk about in that?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks, Jay. As I pull some of the threads together that we've heard on this call, Anil talked about large transformational deals being the platform of choice with customer experience management, simultaneously driving top-line and bottom-line productivity. And the investments around driving those are an imperative in the market. We see a similar dynamic with the new technologies that we're bringing to market on the DME side of the business. We're seeing strong pull from the enterprise. And so as I net out that environment and our performance against that opportunity, it goes to produce the type of sequential RPO progression that we saw Q3 to Q4. Every quarter won't be that large, but the backdrop around that dynamic for the company, given the setup we see, it should be another strong year for RPO throughout the year.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nHey, operator, we're getting close to the top of the hour. We'll take two more questions, and then we'll wrap up. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. David, maybe for you, I had a question just on Firefly and the subscription packets. I know that the commercial model for, I'm sorry, for Firefly credit packets really just started about six weeks ago. But are there any early observations that you've seen just on customers' willingness to add those packets or maybe how they're consuming the initial credit allocation that they get with a Creative Cloud subscription?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, happy to take that. First of all, I think philosophically, going back to what we said at the investor meeting at Maxx, our primary focus here is to drive usage of the generative capabilities. And you see that with the 4.5 billion images generated. That strategy is working. Secondly, we priced the generative packs—sorry, we integrated the generative capabilities and credits directly into our paid plans with the express intent of driving adoption of the paid subscription plans and getting broad proliferation of the ability to use those. And what we are seeing is heavy usage within those paid plans. I think, as we've mentioned in the past, I think I mentioned earlier today as well, generative fill, for example, in Photoshop is the fastest growing feature that we've put into Photoshop in recent memory. So the usage is great. The utilization is great.\nI don't personally expect generative packs to have a large impact in the short-term other than to drive more customers to our paid existing subscription plans. But what will happen over the course of the year and the next few years is that we will be integrating more and more generative capabilities into the existing product workflows. And that will drive, and we'll be integrating capabilities like video generation, which will cost more than one generation. And that will drive a natural inflation in that market, and that will become a driver for growth subsequently. But this year is really primarily focused on getting people into the right paid plans of our flagship applications or Adobe Express and then drive usage in that sense. And then as that happens, the rest will take care of itself in the years ahead.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nMakes sense. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our final question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you for squeezing me in. I really do appreciate it. Dan, I'd like to look a little bit at that Maxx. We discussed how excited you were on Firefly and how it drives Creative Cloud seed and paid seed adoption. Now that you've had a bit of time in market, can you explain how you think about how this will drive the paid seed growth, how strong it could be? And should we expect those seeds are going to be lower unit price because they're going to be entry-level, or do you think that'll get offset by these higher-priced Firefly-driven sales into the enterprise? Thank you.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks, Mark. I think at the core of bringing this technology to life as a standalone application to drive an ideation part of the process, but value in deeply integrating these capabilities into the flagship applications and the workflows that define the creation process, it gives us a lot of surface area with customers and meeting them where they are in their particular needs and use case-specific needs. And so bringing people efficiently top of funnel, establishing the segmentation across that product portfolio, driving efficiency into the creation process, and allowing velocity to enter the ideation, creation, activation, and then instrumentation of that to really refine how companies engage with customers.\nSo it lays the groundwork for us to touch more customers where they are in the ecosystem, bring them on board in a use case-specific way, and then take them on digital journeys, which is something the company is very skilled at with our DDOM to cross-sell and upsell over the life of their engagement with our ecosystem.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nFrom a product perspective, when you think about it, Mark, for us, the biggest thing that we want to do is how do we further make our products accessible, fun, and affordable for an increasing set of customers? And I think Firefly is one of those inflection points that will help everybody get over the blank screen fear that they have. And so first, as you think about Firefly as an ideation and people just coming and want to have creative inspiration, this is whether you're an individual user, whether you're agencies, we're seeing a lot of adoption of Firefly to just start the entire creative process. And that sort of brings them as an on-ramp into Express, which would be the other part. Express is certainly the introductory pricing, the ability to get millions more into the fold.\nAnd the ability right now, it used to be that Express and other offerings in that ilk used to all worry about, \"Do I have the right templates?\" Well, AI is going to completely change that. We have our own models. And so Firefly will allow anybody to take whatever creative idea that they have and make that available. So I think Firefly really helps with the Express offering. On the Creative Cloud, David mentioned this.\nI mean, if you look at the adoption of that functionality and usage that's being driven, whether it's in Photoshop right now, Illustrator as we add video, both in terms of providing greater value, and we certainly will therefore have the uplift in pricing, as well as the retentive ability for Firefly, that's where I think you're going to see a lot of the really interesting aspects of how Firefly will drive both adoption as well as monetization. And then if you go at the other end of the spectrum to the enterprise, Gen Studio, every single marketer that I know, and CFO and CMO are all worried about, \"How much am I spending on data?\nHow do I get agility in my campaigns?\" And the fact that Firefly is integrated into both Express as well as when we do the custom models for them so they can upload their own models and then have the brand consistency that they want. So Firefly really is, the fact that we have our own models, a great catalyst for business all across the spectrum. And the usage and the adoption shows that. In emerging markets, as people there in emerging markets are increasingly used to create variants of content and localization of content, that's where we're also seeing a tremendous usage of these particular technologies. So really exciting.\nAnd then you take the same technology that we have in Creative and think about its impact in both Document Cloud when we do that and the ability to have summaries and have conversational interfaces with PDF, thereby making every single PDF, as David again said, both for communication, collaboration, and creation, far more compelling. I think you're going to see that same kind of uplift in usage and therefore monetization on the Acrobat side. And since it was the last question, I mean, for us, we look at FY 2023, and we're really proud of what we were able to accomplish across all spectrums: top-line revenue, RPO and driving book of business, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, and profitability. And we think '24 is going to be exactly more of the same, which is continuing to drive great innovation, great product growth, great profitability.\nClearly, I think there's been a set of questions around the digital media ARR and what our take is on that. And we're extremely confident about how that continues to be a growth business. And perhaps the pricing impact was overestimated. And as we said, this is, again, a new growth business, and it'll be a multi-year pricing benefit for us as we think about the uplift that we have. So we're really pleased. We appreciate your being on the call. And like many of you wished us, happy holidays, and we hope to see you soon. Thank you for joining us.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nThanks, everyone. Happy holidays. This concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon. Adobe had another record Q3, achieving revenue of $4.89 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.05, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.09, representing 26% and 20% year-over-year growth, respectively. Driving this success is a rich and innovative product roadmap. The advances we're delivering across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud are enabling us to attract an ever-growing set of users while delivering more value to existing customers. Yesterday's exciting announcements add to this roadmap.\nWith the commercial availability of our generative AI capabilities, natively integrated in Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Express, and Adobe Experience Cloud, we're unleashing a new era of AI-enhanced creativity for millions of customers around the globe. We're bringing generative AI to life across our portfolio of apps and services to deliver magic and productivity gains. Our rich data sets enable us to create foundation models in categories where we have deep domain expertise. In the six months since launch, Firefly has captivated people around the world who have generated over two billion images.\nWe're excited about the potential to reimagine the content supply chain for all businesses through the integration of our clouds, enabling the delivery of personalized and engaging customer experiences. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity, and power digital businesses is driving our growth across every geography. By delivering innovative technology platforms and services, we continue to advance our industry leadership and delight a growing universe of customers. I'll now turn it over to David to share more about our momentum in the digital media business.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q3, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million and revenue of $3.59 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strength in both our Creative and Document businesses. On the Creative side, digital content creation and consumption are exploding across every creative category, customer segment, and media type. Creative Cloud is the leading creativity platform, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for every discipline across imaging, photography, design, video, animation, and 3D.\nWe're excited about the growth we're driving with our creative flagship products and with Adobe Express, our AI-first all-in-one creativity app that makes it fast, easy, and fun for any user to design and share standout content. Yesterday's announcements highlighted several advances to our creative business. First, after an unprecedented beta that saw over two billion images generated, Adobe Firefly models and the Firefly web application are now commercially available.\nFirefly supports text prompts in over 100 languages and enables users around the world to create content that is designed to be safe for commercial use. We will continue to train and release new Firefly foundation models in areas where we have rich data sets and expertise, such as imaging, vector, video, design, 3D, and more. Second, Adobe Firefly-powered features are now natively integrated into several Creative Cloud apps, including Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Photoshop, Generative Recolor in Illustrator, and Text to Image and Text Effects in Adobe Express.\nThese deep integrations deliver more creative power than ever before to customers, enabling them to experiment, ideate, and create in completely new ways. Third, Adobe Firefly for Enterprise is now generally available for businesses to enable both creative teams and knowledge workers to confidently deploy AI-generated content. Adobe will empower customers to create custom models using proprietary assets to generate branded content and offer access to Firefly APIs so customers can embed the power of Firefly into their own content creation and automation workflows.\nAnd finally, we announced subscription offerings, including new generative AI credits with the goal of enabling broad access and user adoption. Generative credits are tokens that enable customers to turn text-based prompts into images, vectors, and text effects with other content types to follow. Free and trial plans include a small number of monthly fast generative credits that will expose a broad base of prospects to the power of Adobe's generative AI expanding our top of funnel.\nPaid Firefly Express and Creative Cloud plans will include a further allocation of fast generative credits. After the planned specific number of generative credits is reached, users will have an opportunity to buy additional fast generative credit subscription packs. In Q3, we added $332 million of creative ARR and achieved $2.91 billion of revenue, growing 14% year-over-year. Business highlights include the integration of Firefly into Photoshop and Illustrator. Over three million users have downloaded the Photoshop and Illustrator beta releases.\nThe general availability of Adobe Express now includes support for editing and posting designs, videos, images, PDFs, presentations, and more. Express features include Firefly-powered text-to-image and text effects. Express is already being used by millions of people globally. New AI and 3D features in Premiere Pro and After Effects, including enhanced speech and text-based editing in Premiere Pro and a new 3D workspace in After Effects. The text-based editing feature in Premiere Pro received the 2023 Hollywood Professional Association Award for Engineering Excellence.\nNew Lightroom mobile now integrates directly with the camera roll and introduced a streamlined interface to make editing even easier on the go. The introduction of new video assets in Adobe Stock and strong product-led growth motions drove a record Q3 for the Stock business. Key customer wins include Amazon, Havas, Paramount, SAP, Southern Graphics, Take-Two Interactive, and U.S. Department of Energy. As we have continued to add new applications and deliver innovations across our creative offerings, we announced price updates for certain Creative Cloud plans across the Americas and Europe starting 1 November 2023.\nIn addition to being a growth driver in the Creative Cloud business, Acrobat and PDF continue to power the Document Cloud business. Whether it's a sales contract, legal document, or a back-to-school form, seamless document workflows across every device and platform are more important than ever for all of us to be productive in our professional and personal lives. Document Cloud is powering document productivity and automation across the web, desktop, and mobile. In Q3, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $685 million, growing 15% year-over-year.\nWe added $132 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Business highlights include significant growth in monthly active users across web, mobile, and embedded third-party app ecosystems, reflecting our growing top of funnel and the effectiveness of our product-led growth execution. Strong mobile momentum reflecting the value of Acrobat as an essential productivity application on mobile devices. Adoption of Acrobat and Acrobat Sign through increased link sharing for enhanced collaboration and approval workflows.\nEnhanced PDF workflows across Acrobat and Express, making it seamless to create visually stunning PDFs. A new Adobe PDF Electronic Seal API, which is a cloud-based end-to-end solution for applying electronic seals on PDFs at enterprise scale. Key customer wins include Citibank, GlaxoSmithKline, Emerson Electric, Morgan Stanley, and Volkswagen. We continue to be excited about the pending Figma acquisition, which will reimagine the future of creativity and productivity. We remain engaged with regulators and have confidence in the merits of the case.\nWe look forward to hosting Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference next month in Los Angeles, where we will welcome 10,000 members of our global community and engage with hundreds of thousands more online. We will hear from inspiring creators and unveil innovations across Creative Cloud, Firefly, and Express. In summary, we are excited about the pace of innovations across our Digital Media products and continued execution across multiple growth drivers. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. Every company sees digital as an opportunity to drive experience-led growth. As I've spent time with customers across the world, it's clear that they are prioritizing investments in customer experience management technology to improve customer acquisition, engagement, retention, and operational efficiency. We are driving revenue growth across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences, and marketing workflows, leveraging the Adobe Experience platform, demonstrating the strength of our business.\nBrands around the globe are working with Adobe to accelerate personalization at scale through generative AI. With the announcement of Adobe GenStudio, we are revolutionizing the entire content supply chain by simplifying the creation-to-activation process with generative AI capabilities and intelligent automation. Marketers and creative teams will now be able to create and modify commercially safe content to increase the scale and speed at which experiences are delivered.\nIn Q3, we continue to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.23 billion in revenue, representing 11% year-over-year growth, as a growing number of enterprises turn to Adobe as their trusted partner for customer experience management. Subscription revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Adobe Experience Cloud delivers predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences, from acquisition to monetization to retention. We are driving strong enterprise adoption of Adobe Experience platform and native apps, including Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics.\nFor example, the Coca-Cola Company is leveraging Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer to bring together 98 million customer profiles globally into a single CDP to quickly deliver personalized campaigns and experiences. smart Europe, an all-electric automotive brand, is using Adobe Experience Cloud to offer customers the ability to personalize their vehicle purchases through the integration of Adobe Workfront, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Adobe Experience Manager. Business highlights include strong momentum across AEP and native apps, with the total book of business surpassing $600 million during the quarter.\nAdobe Journey Optimizer book of business more than doubled year-over-year as customers increasingly drive omnichannel personalization and engagement. Continued innovation in Adobe Experience Manager with AEM assets now natively integrated with Firefly and Express, enabling any employee across an organization to generate and reuse beautiful on-brand content. Growth of our Workfront business, reflecting our ability to serve the workflow and collaboration needs of enterprise customers and agencies. In Q3, we added Havas to the growing list of top agencies standardizing on Adobe for their content supply chain. Expanded strategic partnership with Amazon.\nGiven customer demand, we will jointly deliver AEP on AWS, and Amazon will deploy Experience Cloud across their enterprise. Adobe's leadership in content management systems was recognized across three industry analyst reports, including the IDC MarketScape for Full-stack Content Management Systems, the IDC MarketScape for Hybrid Headless CMS, and the Forrester Wave for Content Management Systems. Adobe was also named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce, as well as the IDC MarketScape for Omnichannel Marketing Platforms for B2C Enterprises.\nKey customer wins include Amazon, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Dollar General, Havas, Intuit, IRS, Jet2.com, Lufthansa, Macy's, MSC Cruises, Novo Nordisk, and SAP. These and other customers continue to prioritize investments in customer experience management solutions despite increased scrutiny of enterprise IT spend. Our solutions enable enterprises to simultaneously achieve the twin goals of driving new customer acquisition and serving existing customers to deliver profitable growth.\nAdobe is well-positioned to keep winning with our differentiated offerings, track record of innovations, and ability to drive ROI for companies across industries. We're looking forward to a strong close to the year. I will now pass it to Dan.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q3, fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Adobe's performance in Q3 demonstrates something that makes us exceptional: the combination of growth and profitability. In fact, at Adobe, rather than talking about the trade-offs between growth or profitability, we call it an \"and\" statement. Growth and profitability is not new for us. We have been delivering both for a very long time, and it is at the core of our operating philosophy. It all starts with prioritization, innovation, and a sharp focus on execution.\nThis philosophy shines through in our Q3 results. We're investing in technology platforms, global campaigns to attract and engage millions of customers, and recruiting the best and brightest people in our industry. While doing that, Adobe is driving performance on margin and earnings, demonstrating what a special company we are. In Q3, Adobe achieved revenue of $4.89 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. GAAP-diluted earnings per share was $3.05, up 26% year-over-year, and non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share was $4.09, up 20% year-over-year.\nOther business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $3.59 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.23 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.87 billion, RPO of $15.72 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 2.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q3 revenue of $3.59 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency.\nWe added $464 million of net new ARR in the quarter, our strongest Q3 on record, exiting the quarter with $14.60 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.91 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $332 million of net new Creative ARR in Q3, with strong demand across our offerings.\nThird quarter Creative growth drivers included: new user growth across geographies, customer segments, and creative offerings, driven by innovation and targeted campaigns utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model; outstanding top of funnel performance resulting from viral community excitement and success of our product-led growth strategy, driving traffic to adobe.com; single-app subscriptions for Photoshop driven by interest in the magic of Firefly, Generative Fill, and Generative Expand; another great quarter for value-added services, including strong customer demand for Adobe Stock; continued customer adoption of Acrobat CC; strong engagement and retention across customer segments; and success in the enterprise driven by transformational ETLAs that span the entire Creative portfolio, including CC All Apps for creative teams, Express for knowledge workers, Frame for collaboration, and Adobe Stock and Firefly for content.\nAdobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $685 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 15% in constant currency, and we added $132 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter.\nThird quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included: success with new customer acquisition through our Reader and Acrobat Web funnels and distribution partners, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year for Acrobat Web; strong demand for Acrobat subscriptions across customer segments and geographies, driven by targeted offers; strength and monetization from Acrobat mobile, which grew ending ARR over 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by product innovation and conversion; and traction in B2B with strong unit demand for our team offering through the reseller and direct routes to market.\nTurning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q3, we achieved revenue of $1.23 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 11% in constant currency. Q3 subscription revenue was $1.10 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency.\nThird quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included: demand for our Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, including Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics, and Adobe Journey Optimizer. In Q3, subscription revenue for AEP and apps grew 60% year-over-year; strength in content and commerce with Adobe Experience Manager continuing to set the standard for enterprise content management; growth of our Workfront business as workflow and collaboration are essential components of an enterprise content supply chain solution; strong retention rates in the quarter as we continue to focus on value realization to our Digital Experience customers; and continued momentum in transformational platform deals with large enterprises adopting our end-to-end suite of applications.\nAdobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with the vesting of share-based payments in the quarter. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.72 billion, growing 11% year-over-year or 13% when adjusting for a 2% FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $7.52 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.87 billion. In Q3, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $3.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020.\nFactoring in current macroeconomic conditions and year-end seasonal strength, for Q4, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $4.975 to 5.025 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $520 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.67 to 3.70 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.25 to 1.27 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.11 to 1.13 billion; tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $3.10 to 3.15; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.10 to 4.15.\nQ3 was a great quarter for Adobe, and I couldn't be more pleased with how the company is positioned to continue to deliver for our customers and investors. We're looking forward to our investor meeting at Adobe MAX on 10 October, where we'll do a deep dive into our AI innovation. I hope to see you there. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan. Adobe's strong Q3 results are a reflection of our team's exceptional execution. We recently lost our beloved co-founder, John Warnock. John's brilliance and innovations changed the world. He was one of the greatest inventors of our generation and an inspiration to the technology industry. While we miss him tremendously, it gives me great comfort knowing that John was so proud of all the innovation Adobe continues to deliver.\nAs someone who shares John's passion for product and innovation, I'm exceptionally energized by the technology platforms we are delivering, with AI at the center across our three clouds to delight customers. Our brand, technology, and our talented employees position us for a strong close to the year and continued growth in the decades to come. Adobe's best days are ahead of us. Thank you. We will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Please limit yourself to one question. Again, please press star one if you would like to signal. And our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and a really nice quarter. Dan, actually, a margin question for you and kind of a riddle that we've been thinking about. We've been told generative AI is really expensive to run. The inference and training costs are really high. You guys have been running a beta for a while, 2 million energies generated. There's a lot of functionality already in the product, and your operating margins are up. Your gross margins are up on a year-on-year basis. So how are you able to do that? Where are these costs going, if you will?\nAnd on a go-forward basis, as all this stuff becomes generally available, how should we think about that gross margin impact or the overall margin impact of generative AI on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, thanks, Keith. So as you rightfully point out, the engine of innovation at the company is really strong. A lot of exciting announcements this week, but we've been at this now a year, bringing the magic of generative AI and Firefly to life. And we're just getting started from an innovation standpoint. Over the last six months, we've been live with the beta. And as you point out, our customers have generated over two billion images. And I know it's not lost on people. All this has done while we're delivering strong margins.\nBut when we take a step back and think about these technologies, we have investments from a COGS standpoint, inferencing, content; from an R&D standpoint, training, creating foundation models. And David alluded to it in his prepared comments, the image model for Firefly family of models is out, but we're going to bring other media types to market as well. So we're making substantive investments. When I go back to the framing of my prepared comments, we really have a fundamental operating philosophy that's been alive at the company for a long time: growth and profitability.\nWe're going to prioritize, we're going to innovate, and we're going to execute with rigor. And you see that coming through in all of the financial results of the company. As we think about the profile going forward, what I'll come back to is when we initially set fiscal 2023 targets, implicit in those targets was a 44.5% operating margin.\nIf you think about how we just guided Q4, where we've got these four great new products and these technologies infused into the product lineup, and all of the support we're going to do as we roll these out on our MAX conference down in LA, again, to keep the enthusiasm with the customer base building, implicit in that guide is an operating margin of around 45.5%.\nSo as you think about us leading this industry, leading the inflection that's unfolding in front of us, that mid-40s number we think is the right ballpark to think about the margin structure of the company as we continue to drive this technology and leadership. Looking forward to the Q4 earnings call where we will share more about our fiscal 2024 targets.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nAnd maybe, Keith, just 30 seconds to add to that, for investors like you who want to make sure we're not, in any way not investing in the future, we are investing on training for 3D, for video, for new forms of imaging and vectors. So what we are confident is while we continue to invest in that, the scrutiny that Dan and his team have on other expenses, that we can continue to drive top-line growth as well as cash flow and EPS. So I think we're unique in that respect.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nDefinitely. Very impressive, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI'm sorry to hear of John Warnock's passing. My condolences. But congrats on the quarter. As we look at the pricing model for generative AI products, which are based on consumption, do you think that these—rather, how additive do you think the generative AI offerings will be to the growth profile of the company going forward? And also one for Dan, when you look at your Q4 guidance, are you contemplating—it looks like it's not largely changed versus the Street's prior expectations.\nAre we not embedding any opportunities to show what the generative AI products can do because they seem to be largely incremental to what had been contemplated when you first gave guidance fall of last year? Thank you so much.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, Kash, maybe David and I can take the first parts of the question. And just again, for everybody on the call, I think to summarize the new offerings that we have, we've announced that we have a Firefly subscription. So you can use a free trial number of credits, and after that, you can actually subscribe to Firefly. We have Adobe Express, which now includes an allocation of Firefly. We certainly have the Creative Cloud products and Photoshop and Illustrator that have it.\nWe have generation credit packs, and we have GenStudio for the enterprise and to be able to deal with it. So first, I just wanted to make sure that you recognized the tremendous innovation that we're delivering associated with that. And as you know, one of the things that we have done is to really focus on both new user acquisition, which is going to be driven across all of those offerings, as well as with the price increase, given there is an allocation associated with it for existing customers, they will start to see that as they roll over and they have to renew their subscription.\nSo I just wanted to set that bit, and maybe then I'll ask David to add a little bit about each of these and how we see that play out.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Thanks, Shantanu. Yeah, Shantanu said that we look at the business implications of this through those two lenses: new user adoption, first and foremost, and then sort of opportunity to continue to grow the existing book of business. On the new user side, we've said this for years, our focus continues to be on proliferation. We believe that we have a massive number of users in front of us. We continue to have our primary focus being net user ads and subscribers. And so the goal here on proliferation is to get the right value to the right audience at the right price.\nAnd if I think about the four new offerings that Shantanu teed up, I think two of them are primed to maybe be on the earlier side of that. First, on the individual side, Express. It's been in the market for over a year now, and the new release of Express is a massive step forward in terms of the abilities that it has, both everything from performance to support for a broader set of things beyond design into video and into illustration, into PDF and document workflows. So there's just a tremendous amount of new value that we've added, including generative AI into that. So we think that Express will be an early indicator of that success that we're talking about.\nThe second one is the work that we're doing in the DME business in conjunction with Anil and the DX business around enterprises, so GenStudio, and enabling the broad base of marketers to actually use Express in conjunction with the Creative Studio teams using Creative Cloud to really accelerate their use and creation of content. So that really, in the context of the short-term contributors, we think that will be really meaningful. We also expect that as we do this and drive new users, we expect to see a lot of new users come into the free plans, and that's going to take a little time to ramp.\nWe'll bring them into the Adobe family, get them using the products, and ramp them to greater value over time. So first and foremost, proliferation on new users. The second thing is going to be on the book of business. And here, basically, the pricing changes, just as a reminder, they have a rolling impact. We're going to start them late in Q4, and we're going to start it in certain geos only. And then we're going to have a measured rollout in new countries over the course of the next couple of years. And then certainly also, as it relates to enterprise customers, the renewal timing will probably take about three years given the multi-year contracts that we have in place.\nSo net-net, we see this truly as a seminal moment for how we're going to grow the business, but it's going to take a few years to play out, and we're really excited about sort of what this means for bringing new customers into the franchise.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nAnd maybe, Kash, just to then tie that all together, in terms of the numbers that we've given for Digital Media ARR, because you asked the question from the beginning of the year. Remember, I think we guided to $1.65 billion if you look at what it is, even with our Q4 guide, that's I think $200 million more than that, $1.86 billion or something to that effect. And since we guided in Q3, for Q3 and Q4, $100 million. So we continue to be really confident, and we're excited about the roadmap.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. Anil, actually, my question is for you. Obviously, a lot to talk about with Firefly in the Digital Media business, and it's very clearly a revenue opportunity there. I'm wondering, how do you think about the generative AI roadmap or revenue opportunity in the digital experience part of the business? I know we talked about the content supply chain, but how do you think about how do you think about the future of generative AI in your business?\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nYeah. Thanks, Saket. Shantanu and David already talked about the Adobe GenStudio, and we're really excited about that. This is a unique opportunity, as you said, for enterprises to really create personalized content and drive efficiencies as well through automation and efficiency. And when you look at the entire chain of what enterprises go through, from content creation, production, workflow, and then activation through DX, through all the apps we have on our platform, we have the unique opportunity to do that.\nWe already have deployed it within Adobe for our own Photoshop campaigns, and we're working with a number of agencies and customers to do that. So this is a big net new opportunity for us with Adobe GenStudio. We're also working on generative AI for other DX applications as well. And at the investor meeting in October, we'll share more details. But we see a similar opportunity with generative AI to bring together the ability for a number of users across marketing departments and organizations to be able to use the Adobe Experience platform and apps, and it'll act as a co-pilot to accelerate the use cases that they bring to life. So we'll share more about that at the investor meeting.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nSaket, maybe just to give Anil and the team a lot of credit for what they actually accomplished in Q3 as well. The wins in Q3 in the Enterprise actually included a lot of the components of GenStudio, both in the Digital Media as well as in the Digital Experience. So certainly, the transformational deals that we're talking about, a big part of that is the synergy between the two clouds. So I wanted to point that out as well.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nAnd if I could actually just add one quick thing is the GenStudio work that Anil's team has been doing, we've actually been using that within the Digital Media business already to release some of the campaigns that we've released this quarter. So it's one of these things that it's great to see the impact it's having on our business, and that becomes a selling point for other businesses too.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat to hear. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd moving on to Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, thank you for taking the question. Congratulations as well on a strong quarter. So when I look at Firefly, the amount of image generation in a six-month period is clearly pretty stunning. And I'm just wondering if you're able to provide any additional color, whether it be monthly active users or some other metric that may additionally help all of us gauge the improvements that Firefly is driving to your engagement levels, to your top-of-funnel, etc. Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Happy to talk about that. It's been a remarkable few months. I mean, we've said a few things. First is that the viral excitement that we saw because of Firefly on social has been hugely beneficial, and it's certainly driven a lot of top-of-funnel opportunity for us. In addition to that, one of the things that we were very excited about is when we integrated it into our Creative Pro applications, Illustrator and Photoshop primarily, we saw over three million downloads of those beta applications, which is something we've never seen before. That gives you a sense of how thirsty the existing customer base is for the generative capabilities that we have as well.\nAnd lastly, one of the things that we're very excited about, and we obviously track very carefully, is what does this do in terms of giving us access to new users that don't typically come to Adobe? And both Express and Firefly, and in particular, the integration of Firefly and Express has been a real accelerant to that. So it's been nice to see us not just getting excitement within the current base, but seeing millions of other users coming in that would not have typically come to Adobe for a product and then starting their journey with Adobe through Firefly and Express.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nTwo other maybe financial indicators to that, Gregg, are first, the Photoshop single app, and I think Dan referred to that. Even in the beta, that actually drove a lot of Photoshop single app, and the early indicators of how that also benefits retention in the entire book of business. So both of those are also good financial indicators of the potential of AI.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have a question from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nWonderful. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about a comment that I think David made earlier in the call where you're working hard to make Firefly the option for content design to be safe. I would love to double-click on that, understand a little bit how is Adobe the safe option, and how is the company making this Firefly and this new generative frontier the safe option for enterprises?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. So from the very beginning of Firefly, we took a very different approach to how we were doing generative. We started by looking at and working off the Adobe Stock base, which are contents that are licensed and very clearly we have the right to use. And we looked at other repositories of content where they didn't have any restrictions on usage, and we've pulled that in. So everything that we've trained on has gone through some form of moderation and has been cleared by our own legal teams for use and training.\nAnd what that means is that the content that we generate is, by definition, content that isn't then stepping on anyone else's brand and/or leveraging content that wasn't intended to be used in this way. So that's the foundation of what we've done. We've gone further than that, of course, and we've now actually been working with our stock contributors. We've announced, in fact, yesterday we had our first payout of contributions to contributors that have been participating and adding stock for the AI training.\nAnd we're able to leverage that base very effectively so that if we see that we need additional training content, we can put a call to action, call for content out to them, and they're able to bring content to Adobe in a fully licensed way. So for example, earlier this quarter, we decided that we needed a million new images of crowd scenes. And so we put a call to action out. We were able to gather that content in, but it's fully licensed and fully moderated in terms of what comes in. So as a result, all of the content we generate is safe for commercial use.\nThe second thing is that because of that, we're able to go to market and also indemnify customers in terms of how they're actually leveraging that content and using it for content that's being generated. And so enterprise customers find that to be very important as we bring that in, not just in the context of Firefly standalone, but we integrate it into our Creative Cloud applications and Express applications as well. So the whole ecosystem has been built on that. And the last thing I'll say is we've been very focused on fair generation.\nSo we look intentionally for diversity of people that are generated, and we're looking to make sure that the content we generate doesn't create or cause any harm. And all of those things are really good business decisions and differentiate us from others.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat to hear. Thanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have a question from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYes. Thank you. I want to go back. David, I wanted to hear your perspective on kind of the third cloud, the Document Cloud, if you will, as we look out over the next 12 months. And the spirit of the question is there's a lot of attention, appropriately so, given Firefly and whatnot, and perhaps even lending itself in the Experience Cloud. But does GenAI provide any tailwinds associated with the Document Cloud, or is it sort of the existing drivers that will help contribute to growth as we look at next year? But any just kind of what are the key things that we should be thinking about for Document Cloud? Many thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. First of all, we are very happy with the quarter Doc Cloud had the ending book of business grew 22% in constant currency. And the strength of that is really driven based on top-of-funnel growth, right? So Acrobat on the web had a phenomenal year-over-year growth rate. We've been working very actively to get Acrobat sort of deployed as plugins within the browsers.\nWe've got a great we've been doing a lot of product-led growth work in the products themselves to drive link sharing so that more and more people are not just using our products, but as they share links, we're actually able to capture more people and build growth loops. Signatures has been also doing incredibly well. So as we've got this broad-based proliferation of our surfaces that are available and continue to grow in terms of both free and paid usage, it creates a surface area that we can introduce a lot of really interesting things into.\nWe haven't announced anything publicly associated with GenAI directly inside of Acrobat, but I think you can fairly safely expect to hear more about that from us soon. And what makes GenAI particularly interesting as it relates to Acrobat is the distribution that we have with Acrobat. So if Acrobat is — and Reader are in front of hundreds of millions of people on a monthly basis, our ability to insert generative AI into their workflows, just like we've been able to really differentiate our work on generative AI and creative by inserting it into the workflows of creative folks, I think that becomes the secret sauce to how we differentiate ourselves.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nInteresting. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nShantanu, you mentioned success in ETLAs. What's driving that, especially given some of the macro jitters are still lingering? Are you starting to see those jitters go away, and that's a result of what's happening with the ETLAs?\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nI think in the ETLAs specifically, Brent, both to the comments that David and Anil mentioned, the first is the amount of content that people are creating. There's a lot of interest associated with ensuring that the combination of Creative Cloud plus Express, that people can really understand what they are spending on their content, as well as find ways to use AI to automate it, to localize it, to improve production costs. So I think that message is certainly resonating with people and the fact that Express can be a productivity application for every knowledge worker in the enterprise, much like Acrobat as well.\nSo I think both of those are really leading to a significant amount of great conversations. I think mobile, David perhaps mentioned even in his prepared remarks how mobile's been one of the tailwinds that we've seen, Brent. So I think that's also working. So I think investment in productivity gains is clearly top of mind right now, and both of these play well into that narrative in enterprises.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have a question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I guess a two-parter on generative AI. First, just around the pricing model for generative credits, obviously very progressive. And I guess how should we think about as we go forward, and you've seen at least on the hobbyist side, some of the usage of Firefly and within Express, how do we think about for the two cohorts of both hobbyists and professional creatives? How many credits are kind of a typical user or use case likely to drive in a given month?\nAnd to the question that you got kind of about Document Cloud and the impact of generative AI on that business, is it fair to think that given the pricing that's been announced, the next wave of incremental innovation, is that going to come more from new product availability, or should we think about more pricing-enabled levers to come?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nI think, Alex, on the first question associated with how did we think about pricing, I mean, first, it's important to remember the breadth of all of the segments that we serve. In other words, how we think about K through 12 all the way to the largest enterprise in the world. I think it's fair to say that philosophically, we wanted to drive more adoption, and therefore the pricing as it relates to what's included in the at least short run for Firefly subscriptions, Express subscriptions, GenStudio in terms of how much they can get within an enterprise is going to be the bulk of how we recognize the ARR.\nI think getting that adoption and usage is where the primary focus is going to be in terms of the new user adoption, as well as for existing customers, the pricing upgrade. So that's how we think about it. We certainly need the ability to have the generative packs, but I think just getting everybody exposed to it. One of the real innovations that we did that's driven tremendous uptake in that is what we've called this context-aware sort of menus within Photoshop. So it's so front and center, you'll start to see that being rolled out in all of the other applications. So that's sort of the focus. Let's get the core subscriptions.\nLet's get all of them exposed to it, and let's make sure that we're covering what we need to by the pricing actions that we took. So that was sort of the focus. I think on the Doc Cloud part and how we look at it to add to, again, what David said, I mean, some of the things that people really want to know is, how can I have a conversational interface with the PDF that I have? Not just the PDF that I have open right now, but the PDF that are all across my folder, then across my entire enterprise knowledge management system, and then across the entire universe.\nSo much like we are doing in Creative, where you can start to upload your images to get your train your own models within an enterprise, where there's off-the-spot interest. The number of customers who want to talk to us now that we've sort of designed this to be commercially safe and say, hey, how do we create our own model? Whether you're a Coke or whether you're a Nike, think of them as having that.\nI think in the document space, the same interest will happen, which is we have all our knowledge within an enterprise associated with PDFs: Adobe, help me understand how your AI can start to deliver services like that. I think, you know, that's the way you should also look at the PDF opportunity that exists, just more people taking advantage of the trillions of PDFs that are out there in the world and being able to do things. The last thing maybe I'll mention on this front, Alex, is the APIs. Part of what we are also doing with PDFs is the fact that you can have all of this now accessible through APIs.\nIt's not just the context of the PDF, the semantic understanding of that to do specific workflows. We're starting to enable all of that as well. Hopefully that gives you some flavor. You're right. The generative credits have been designed to more for adoption right now, but we also wanted to make sure that at the high end, we were careful about how much generative credits we allow.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. And just one thing to add to that, Alex, is that one of the things we did — first of all, it was a very thoughtful, deliberate decision to go with the generative credit model. The limits, as you can imagine, were very considered in terms of how we set them. The limits are, of course, fairly low for free users. The goal there is to give them a flavor of it and then help them convert. For paid users, especially for people in our single apps and all apps plans, one of the things we really intended to do was try and drive real proliferation of the usage. We didn't want there to be generation anxiety put in that way.\nWe wanted them to use the product. We wanted the Generative Fill and Generative Expand. We wanted the vector creation. We want to build the habits of using it. And then what will happen over time as we introduce 3D, as we introduce video and design and vectors, and as we introduce these Acrobat capabilities that Shantanu was talking about, the generative credits that are used in any given month continues to go up because they're getting more value out of it. And so that's the key thing. We want people to just start using it very actively right now and build those habits.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper clear, super thoughtful. If I could sneak one in for Dan of the $520 million in the net new ARR for Q4, just roughly you've talked about before having some impact from the generative AI products that you were going to launch this year. Is it fair to assume it's very minimal in that $520 million?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, I would say it's modest impact to the business in Q4. Again, a quarter from now, when we give our FY 2024 targets, we'll have more to say of what that looks like going forward, but modest impact in Q4.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "And we'll take a question from Brad Zelnik with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnik\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. David, you talked about making Firefly APIs available to customers to embed Firefly into their own content creation and workflows. Can you talk about the use cases and monetization? And is this something you foresee partners leveraging as well into their own third-party offerings?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYes, absolutely. Our goal right now is for enterprises and third parties that we work with is to provide a few things. The first is this ability, obviously, to have API access to everything that we are building so that they can build it into their workflows and their automation stack. The second thing is to give them the ability to extend or train their own models as well. So as we mentioned earlier, our core model, foundation model, is a very clean model. It generates great content, and you can rely on it commercially.\nWe want our customers and partners to be able to extend that model with content that is relevant to them so that Firefly is able to generate content in their brand or in their style. So we'll give them the ability to train their own model as well. And then last, but certainly not least, we'll give them some core workflows that will work with our existing products, whether it's Express or whether it's Creative Cloud or GenStudio as well, so that they can then integrate everything they're doing onto our core platform.\nAnd then from a monetization perspective, you can imagine the metering concepts that we have for generative credits extending to API calls as well. And of course, those will all be, you know, custom negotiated deals with partners and enterprises.\n\nBrad Zelnik\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nHey, operator. We're getting close to the top of the hour. We'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Shantanu, over the last decade or more, one of the most important attributes of how you've managed your product portfolio has been the intra-segment and inter-segment integrations, particularly between Digital Media and DX. There is, as you know, a famous acronym for that. Now, when we think about the current generation of integrations that you've just announced, including yesterday, aside from the Firefly-ing of the product line and the proliferation of Firefly, what are some of the internal developmental changes that you yourselves have had to make in order to support the development of new integrations, new packaging?\nWhat are you doing differently internally? And then externally, particularly to support the new generation of products, what are you having to invest in in terms of customer support and enabling their adoption?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChair and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah, Jay, I mean, and certainly I think at MAX also you'll see a bunch more of the innovation. I think first internally, I'd be remiss if I didn't start off by saying how really thrilled I am with how quickly the company has embraced the possibilities of AI, how we've run all of these betas out there at a scale that, as we have said, is unprecedented, dealing with the differentiation that we can provide, whether that's how we deal with the data, understanding the indemnification, how we embed all of this AI stuff in the interfaces. And we've already shown that in Photoshop, Illustrator, Express, as well as create the new offering.\nSo I think the pace of innovation internally of what we have done is actually truly amazing. I mean, relative to a lot of the companies that are out there and the fact that we've gone from talking about this to very, very quickly making it commercially available, I don't want to take for granted the amount of work that went into that. I think internally it is really galvanized because we are our own biggest user of these technologies. What we are doing associated with the campaigns and the GenStudio that we are using, as David alluded to it, our Photoshop Everyone Can campaign or the Acrobats Got It campaign, or how we will be further delivering campaigns for Express as well as for Firefly.\nAll of this is built on this technology. And we use Express every day, much like we use Acrobat every day. So I think it's really enabled us to say, are we really embracing all of this technology within the company? And that's been a big change because I think the creative products, we've certainly had phenomenal usage within the company, but the extent to which the 30,000 employees can now use our combined offering, that is very, very different internally. So very pleased associated with that. And I think one way in which that manifests is that all of our product reviews right now include all three groups.\nSo there's very little product sort of reviews that happen without people from Creative and Document and the Experience Cloud being part of it. So that's one of them. I think the work that we have already put in on the digital excellence as part of DDOM, that also gives us a lot of confidence of now that we have this breadth of offering, how do we make sure that we can personalize the offerings?\nPart of the success that was driven in this quarter, Jay, was to do with the fact that the stock and these value-added services, I think the digital excellence team in terms of the DDOM have really got very good at segmenting our customers and understanding how we can make sure that they have the right offering. And now think of that with all of the breadth of offerings that we have across mobile and desktop and web. So I think internally and externally, this has been, again, a real sort of drinking from the fire hose of how we embrace AI. And so I think those are really two examples of how we've done it.\nAnd the third thing I would say is that in parallel, internally, we've had to really change. Where prior to this, Jay, we may have said, okay, we're really going to make all of this magic happen in one of our applications. Today, that has to happen not just within the application, which we've certainly done, but it has to happen as an API so that everybody else can use it. It has to happen as a web-only playground, which is what Firefly and Express both are. So the simultaneous release of not just investing in the model, but making sure that's available across all the surfaces, I would say that's another thing. And the last thing I'll leave you with is you've seen this for imaging.\nMake no mistake, those same investments, whether it's in vector or animation or 3D or all of those video certainly are underway. And so I think the parallelism associated with saying, how do we embrace this opportunity? I think that's also been another big change. But I think it's clear, given this was the last question before I hand it over to Jonathan, that a lot of the questions have been focused on understanding right now all of our announcements and the monetization associated with it. But I did want to, again, sort of acknowledge that we have delivered all of this innovation at a breakthrough pace.\nAnd so we'll certainly share more as it relates to how we see this play out. At MAX, you'll see us have more information on the products. And certainly with the 2024 targets, you'll start to get more visibility into how and why we believe this is both a growth opportunity as well as embracing new customers. So thank you for joining us. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Looking ahead, we have an exciting lineup planned for MAX starting on 10 October 2023, and we hope you'll be able to attend the entire conference. At the investor meeting after the day one keynote, we plan to focus on the impact of AI across our customer offerings with previews into our technology roadmap and how these innovations expand Adobe's reach. Given that, fiscal 2024 targets will be provided at our December earnings call. In addition, we're planning another investor event at Adobe Summit in March to give more insight into our addressable markets and financial performance. We hope to see you there. Thanks, everyone, and this concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Vaas, Vice President of investor relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Shantanu Narayen, Adobe's Chair and CEO, David Wadhwani, President of Digital Media, Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience, and Dan Durn, Executive Vice President and CFO. On this call, which is being recorded, we will discuss Adobe's second quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results. You can find our press release, as well as PDFs of our prepared remarks and financial results, on Adobe's Investor Relations website. The information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans, is as of today, 15 June 2023, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today's press release and in Adobe's SEC filings.\nOn this call, we will discuss GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures. Our reported results include GAAP growth rates, as well as constant currency rates. During this presentation, Adobe's executives will refer to constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations are available in our earnings release and on Adobe's investor relations website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had an outstanding quarter, achieving record revenue of $4.82 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.82, and Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.91. Our results demonstrate strong demand across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, with particular strength in Digital Media ARR. Adobe's mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences is more critical than ever, as digital continues to rapidly transform work, life, and play. Our groundbreaking innovations, including the new Adobe Express, the launch of Firefly, our family of creative generative AI models, Copilot functionality in our creative applications, including Photoshop and Illustrator, AI-powered advancements in Acrobat, a new product analytics solution, and the latest capabilities in real-time CDP, are empowering an ever-expanding customer base to imagine, create, and deliver standout content and experiences.\nWe're executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity, and power digital businesses. Every disruptive technology has presented exciting opportunities for Adobe to innovate and increase our addressable market opportunity. This has been true for cloud computing, mobile, and AI. We have delivered hundreds of AI innovations through Adobe Sensei, such as neural filters in Photoshop, liquid mode in Acrobat, and customer AI in Adobe Experience Platform. Our ongoing R&D investments have enabled the rapid development and deployment of Firefly, our generative AI technology. We believe generative AI will drive both further accessibility and adoption of our products. Our generative AI strategy focuses on data, models, and interfaces. Our rich data sets across creativity, documents, and customer experiences enable us to train models on the highest quality assets.\nWe will build foundation models in the categories where we have deep domain expertise, including imaging, vector, video, documents, and marketing. We are bringing generative AI to life as a Copilot across our incredible array of interfaces to deliver magic and productivity gains for a broader set of customers. Since its launch in March, Firefly has captured the imagination of the world with over half a billion generations, and we're just getting started. Our digital experience business is powering personalized customer engagement for companies around the world, enabling them to drive experience-led growth. We're delivering an innovative product roadmap and integrating Sensei Gen AI services across Experience Cloud. Last week, we hosted a successful EMEA Summit with tremendous excitement from thousands of customers and partners, reinforcing that digital is a critical imperative across industries. Adobe's category leadership and mission-critical products will continue to drive our growth.\nFor FY 2023, we now expect Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to end the year ahead of our previously issued revenue and ARR targets, and digital experience to be slightly below our previous annual target, given the current enterprise spend environment. As a result of our groundbreaking innovation and continued execution, we are pleased to raise total Adobe annual revenue and EPS targets. David, over to you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu, and hello, everyone. Adobe has long had a mission to unleash creativity for all, and today, this is more possible than ever through the power of AI. The introduction of the new Adobe Express and Firefly will go down as a seminal moment in our creative history. These innovative products, and our generative AI Copilot in our flagship applications, will extend our leadership in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video, illustration, animation, and 3D, as well as attract an increasingly expansive global audience. In Q2, we achieved net new creative ARR of $354 million and revenue of $2.85 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. We could not be more excited about our generative AI roadmap that will make Adobe products more accessible to an even larger universe of people, while dramatically enhancing productivity for existing customers.\nFirefly is attracting tremendous customer interest and is highly differentiated in the market. It is being directly integrated into our product workflows as a Copilot to accelerate ideation, exploration, and the end-to-end production process. Business and innovation highlights include the beta release of Firefly, Adobe's pioneering family of creative generative AI models, and adobe.com/firefly, a destination that allows users to generate and refine content. Firefly's first model is trained on Adobe Stock images and other openly licensed content designed to generate commercially viable, professional-quality content. Firefly-powered capabilities seamlessly integrated into Photoshop are catalyzing a new era of creative power and precision. The viral response to Photoshop's new generative fill Copilot has been extraordinary across social media platforms. Users have now generated over half a billion assets on the Firefly website and in Photoshop, making these two of our most successful beta releases in company history.\nBuilding on this innovation, earlier this week, we announced Generative Recolor in Illustrator, which will similarly serve as a generative AI Copilot to millions of designers to iterate and transform vector art. We also released an all-new Adobe Express with Firefly generative AI capabilities that revolutionizes how everyone, from students to small business owners, to marketers in large organizations, creates and shares standout content. Adobe Express brings the magic of our technology from Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and Acrobat to combine power and precision with speed and ease. The response to the public beta, in particular the groundbreaking video editing capabilities, has been overwhelmingly positive. The enterprise version of Adobe Express and Firefly will empower every employee in an organization to participate in the creation of content, campaigns, and websites in conjunction with Experience Cloud. New AI-powered text-based editing and automatic tone mapping in Premiere Pro makes video editors more productive.\nAn expanded Frame.io platform that now supports collaboration across PDFs and images, in addition to video, increases the value of Adobe's cross-cloud content supply chain solution. A major Lightroom mobile update that instantly allows you to access photos from Apple iCloud and Android Gallery empowers our growing base of mobile-first and mobile-only users. Continued momentum with our ecosystem of strategic partners drives awareness of our products, and top-of-funnel for Adobe. Google announced that Adobe Firefly will be a premier generative AI partner for Bard, powering text-to-image capabilities. NVIDIA and Adobe announced that we will collaborate on generative AI optimizations across hardware and software. Apple highlighted how Lightroom will empower users to edit photos on the Vision Pro VR headset at WWDC. Momentum across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins: EY, Government of the Philippines, NVIDIA, Omnicom, TAFE New South Wales, and WPP.\nOur generative AI offerings represent additional customer value, as well as multiple new monetization opportunities. First, Firefly will be available both as a standalone freemium offering for consumers, as well as an enterprise offering announced last week. Second, Copilot generative AI functionality within our flagship applications will drive higher RPUs and retention. Third, subscription credit packs will be made available for customers who need to generate greater amounts of content. Fourth, we will offer developer communities access to Firefly APIs and allow enterprises the ability to create exclusive custom models with their proprietary content. Finally, the industry partnerships, as well as Firefly, represent exciting new top-of-funnel acquisition opportunities for Express, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud. Our priority for now is to get Firefly broadly adopted, and we will introduce specific pricing later this year.\nNow turning to the Document Cloud business, PDF has become the de facto standard for the world's unstructured data, and businesses of all sizes are turning to Adobe to help streamline and automate document-based workflows. Adobe Document Cloud offers a comprehensive set of ubiquitous products to accelerate document productivity across every device by seamlessly integrating PDF services into Acrobat. In Q2, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $659 million, growing 14% year-over-year. We added $116 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year. Business and innovation highlights include significant growth in Acrobat Web monthly active users, driven by searches for Acrobat verbs, and further accelerated by an explosion of PDF consumption through our Chrome and Edge extensions. Viral adoption of PDF collaboration services is both increasing active use among existing users and creating a growth loop to bring new users into the Acrobat ecosystem.\nMobile momentum across both App Store downloads as well as documents consumed in Liquid Mode. New workflows between Acrobat and Express allow users to integrate documents seamlessly into their creative process. Express now has full fidelity PDF import and editing, which allows users to make documents visually stunning. Momentum across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins: Boston Consulting Group, Cushman & Wakefield, Novartis, T-Mobile, and WPP. Today marks the 30th anniversary of Acrobat, a significant milestone that is both inspiring and humbling. PDF and Acrobat are more relevant today than ever before. We are incredibly proud of how PDF continues to transform the world of digital documents, powering communication and productivity for billions of people every day, and we know that the best is yet to come.\nThe pending acquisition of Figma will further expand our addressable market, and we have been delighted to hear from customers, partners, and industry analysts who are excited about the benefits that the combination will unlock. We continue to engage in conversations with the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK, the European Commission, and the US Department of Justice as they conduct their regulatory reviews, and given the merits of the case, we believe the transaction should close by the end of 2023. Adobe's digital media business is on a roll. We're rapidly delivering groundbreaking innovations across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Our increasing breadth of offerings is reaching a broader universe of customers, and our incredible go-to-market strength and proven data-driven operating model are propelling the growth of both our emerging and established businesses.\nGiven the momentum, we are raising our net new digital media ARR and revenue targets for fiscal 2023. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. In Q2, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.22 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.07 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth. Customer interest in the digital experience category remains high. Last week, we were excited to spend time with thousands of customers and partners at EMEA Summit. Businesses of all sizes and industries around the world are increasingly relying on digital channels to engage customers and deliver experience-led growth, and they are turning to Adobe as their trusted partner on that journey.

I'll now pass it to Dan.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q2 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Adobe's Q2 results demonstrate strong demand across a diverse portfolio of products, from individuals buying through digital channels to the world's largest enterprises. While we grow existing businesses and deliver world-class profitability, Adobe continues to incubate and invest in groundbreaking new technologies that will change how people work and democratize access to our tools. I couldn't be prouder of how Adobe has navigated the current environment and positioned the company to win. In Q2, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.82 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency.\nBusiness and financial highlights included GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $2.82, and Non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $3.91, digital media revenue of $3.51 billion, net new digital media ARR of $470 million, digital experience revenue of $1.22 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.14 billion, RPO of $15.22 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q2 revenue of $3.51 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $14.14 billion of digital media ARR, growing 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We achieved creative revenue of $2.85 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We added $354 million of net new creative ARR in Q2, with strong digital demand for our offerings throughout the quarter.\nSecond quarter creative growth drivers included new user growth across geographies, customer segments, and creative offerings, driven by targeted campaigns and promotions, and utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model. Strong traffic and conversion on adobe.com. Single app subscriptions, including a strong quarter for imaging driven by the \"Everyone Can Photoshop\" campaign. Strong growth in photography driven by accelerated demand for Lightroom Mobile. Another strong quarter for Adobe Stock and other emerging businesses with exiting ARR for both Frame.io and Substance growing greater than 50% year-over-year in constant currency. Continued success rolling out our new Acrobat CC offering integrated with sign capabilities and success in the enterprise as our creative and collaboration solutions continue to see strong adoption. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $659 million, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency.\nWe added $116 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, crossing the $2.5 billion milestone, with exiting ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Second quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included strong subscription demand for Acrobat with integrated sign capabilities across customer segments and geographies, driven by targeted offers, DDOM insights, and our Acrobat Scottic campaign. Success monetizing new customers through the Acrobat web funnel, with monthly active users growing greater than 50% year-over-year as our product-led growth strategy continues to perform well. Strength in Acrobat mobile downloads, conversion, and engagement, with Liquid Mode usage up over 40% year-over-year and strength in the enterprise driven by seat expansion. This quarter, perpetual sales accounted for less than 5% of Document Cloud revenue. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q2, we achieved revenue of $1.22 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency.\nQ2 subscription revenue was $1.07 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. Second quarter digital experience growth drivers included strong demand for our Adobe Experience Platform in native applications, including Real-time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics, and Adobe Journey Optimizer. In Q2, subscription revenue for AEP and apps grew more than 60% year-over-year. Strength in content and commerce with AEM as a cloud service seeing significant book of business growth in Q2. Customer interest in our content supply chain solution. The value proposition of seamlessly connecting content creation workflows to customer experience management is resonating with enterprises, and is driving accelerated growth for Workfront and our content solutions. Continued value realization from our solutions leading to strong retention across our customer segments, and momentum selling transformational deals to large enterprises adopting our platform and end-to-end suite of applications, including T-Mobile and Omnicom.\nAdobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a Non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.22 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, or 13% when adjusting for a 3% FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.60 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $2.14 billion. In Q2, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $4.15 billion remaining on our $15 billion authorization that was granted in December 2020 and goes through the end of fiscal 2024.\nIn light of the momentum across our business, and factoring in current macroeconomic conditions and summer seasonality, for Q3, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $4.83 to 4.87 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, digital media segment revenue of $3.55 to 3.57 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $1.21 to 1.23 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $1.08 to 1.10 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a Non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.82 to 2.88, and Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95 to 4. Given the company's performance in the first half of the year, and our relentless focus on driving disciplined, profitable growth, we're raising our annual fiscal 2023 targets for EPS and net new digital media ARR.\nWe are also raising our total Adobe revenue target for fiscal 2023, with digital media ahead of our previously issued targets, and digital experience slightly lower. For fiscal 2023, we're now targeting total Adobe revenue of $19.25 to 19.35 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $1.75 billion, digital media segment revenue of $14.10 to 14.15 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $4.85 to 4.90 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $4.30 to 4.35 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a Non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $11.15 to 11.25, and Non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.65 to 15.75. In Q4, we expect to see year-end strength in customer demand for our digital experience and digital media solutions.\nOur updated targets for fiscal 2023 demonstrate solid operating margin expansion in the second half as compared to the second half of fiscal 2022. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with Adobe's performance in the first half of the year. Few companies are capable of delivering strong top and bottom-line growth in a challenging environment while at the same time delivering game-changing innovations that'll drive the next decade of growth. These innovations are generating strong customer demand for our products, shaping fiscal 2023 to be another wonderful year for Adobe. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan. Our strong Q2 results underscore our momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our business. I'm proud of how our employees around the world continue to raise the bar, create the future, and live our purpose. We continue to invest in hiring new college grads and interns to bring the best and brightest talent to Adobe. It's an incredibly exciting time at Adobe. Demand for our category-defining products and services continues to grow. Our innovation engine is delivering Adobe magic for an expanding set of global customers, and our strong execution is enabling us to address a massive market opportunity. 2023 is going to be another phenomenal year for Adobe as we continue to deliver top-line growth and margins while investing in fundamental technologies that expand Adobe's success for decades. Thank you. We will now take questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press Star 1 on your touch-tone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Please limit yourself to one question. Again, that is Star 1 if you would like to signal. The first question will come from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey there. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question, and nice job on the results. I mean, obviously, I think the starting point is with Firefly. We've been fielding a number of questions just on how this alters the size of the market. You had some useful commentary both on monetization and your views on the market. Can you just add some context around early demand signals and how you're expecting this to show up both on the user side of the market and the overall velocity of content generation? Thank you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nSure. Happy to talk about that. We're really excited, if you can't tell on the call, about Firefly and what this represents. The early customer and community response has been absolutely exhilarating for all of us. You heard us talk about over half a billion assets that have already been generated. Generations from Photoshop were 80 times higher than we had originally projected going into the beta. Obviously, feel really good about both the quality of the content being created, and also the ability to scale the product to support that. We've seen incredible social buzz. The Photoshop community is doing what it always does and is using the product, both Firefly and Photoshop, in ways that we didn't even think of when we were initially building the feature set. It's great to see all this organic development and buzz coming up.\nAs we talked about, we're also excited about what this means from a business opportunity perspective. On the retention side, we think the value that we add in the flagship applications is going to be great for existing users. In terms of top-of-funnel, we think that this helps us reach billions of new users because it makes the act of creating more accessible. With regard to conversion, we are very excited about what this can mean for new user onboarding, both Photoshop and Illustrator, and also in Express. It makes the onboarding of new customers, especially early success, far more achievable for them. It introduces new offers with adobe.com/firefly as a destination that we can monetize, and everything that we talked about at Summit last week around what this can be as an enterprise-grade offering.\nOf course, with all of this, we have an opportunity to sell subscription credit packs for upsell opportunities. If you net all that out, we see an ARPU opportunity, we see a number of users opportunity, and also because of retention and LTV opportunity. We expect all of this to play out over many years. We're very focused right now on user acquisition. None of this we expect to impact our Q3 numbers. We'll start to see some of it in Q4, but we don't expect it to be material. As I mentioned, we expect to see it ramp over the next few years. We'll share more specifics of this in the months ahead.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nClearly lots to be excited about there. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Congrats on a great quarter. David, maybe for you, I want to zero in on that point around Firefly and generating billions of potential users in the years ahead. Obviously, still very early with Firefly as well as Adobe Express. I'm curious, what are you seeing with Adobe Express and the ability for Firefly to generate some of that demand or pull through some of that demand for Express, both on the consumer side and the enterprise side?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Very excited on both fronts. As you may have seen, we had a beta release of Express last week. This is a massive update to Express. In fact, it's a brand new product effectively built from the ground up. We believe this is the product for everyone to use. The response has been absolutely incredible.\nBroad-based feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, as you mentioned, because of the integration of Firefly, but also how Firefly is able to integrate directly into the user flows and the user journeys for utilization and generation of video content, also for PDF integration, so people are able to bring in and build end-to-end workflows to generate amazing marketing collateral with PDF. We've seen CC users, existing subscribers for CC, very excited about the workflows that we've introduced with both Illustrator and Photoshop. Illustrator users are able to take their Illustrator output, bring it into Express, add animation, and push it out to social. Photoshop users are taking their corpus of Photoshop templates, and they're making that the foundation for easy editing and sharing for their marketing organizations.\nThat's really been sort of an incredible vote of confidence from everyone that we've seen using the beta, which has also driven the announcements we had last week, specifically around Express and Firefly packaged together for enterprises. The interest that we've seen coming out of that announcement in terms of enterprise interest and pipeline generation associated with that has been terrific. What we're particularly excited about is it brings our clouds together. Creative pros are able to create in Photoshop, Illustrator, and our other flagship applications. Marketers are able to take that content and edit it more quickly in Express. Both of these are orchestrated through Workfront and Frame.io, and they're pushed into AEM. Really a core part of our content supply chain. It really feels like an inflection point for Express as well.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nSakit, maybe if I were to add two things to that. First, I think on the consumer side, with the new Express, if you can imagine it, you can do it. I think it's really powerful. Within an enterprise, much like Acrobat, we want every enterprise employee to now have a combination of both Acrobat and Express.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much, and congrats on the quarter. This one is probably for David again. David, I was just kind of curious when you think about the enterprise part of the digital media business, how, I guess, prepared are customers from a content perspective and the data perspective to take on some of the generative AI capabilities that you guys are bringing to market? I'm sure this blends into Anil too on the Adobe Experience Manager. I was just wondering if you guys could talk about the data aspect of this and how that interplay might help, frankly, both sides of the digital media and the digital experience businesses. Thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nSure. I'll say a few words and then hand it off to Anil as well. As we've talked about, Firefly from the beginning has a few core principles. The first is the quality of output, right? We have capability of text to imaging, text to text effects. We have vectors in there now. We're working on video design, 3D generation as well. We have a series of all this incredible content that we think will be cornerstone of everything needed for enterprise content velocity. The second thing is that we're building it in a way that we can integrate into existing workflows. We've already started to announce integrations into Photoshop, Illustrator, and Express. You'll also start to see us continue those integration points, but you'll also start to see us integrate it more directly into the digital experience workflows as well.\nThird is that, and perhaps most importantly, we've also been able to, because of the way we share and are transparent about where we get our content, we can tell customers that their content generated with Firefly is commercially safe for use. Copyrights are not being violated. Diversity and inclusion is front and center. Harmful imagery is not being generated. We're able to give them that confidence. Also, as part of our enterprise plans, we give them indemnification for the content that's being created. Those things, I think, fundamentally help them engage that.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nAwesome. Just picking up on what you said, I think if you look at Express, Firefly, and also the Sensei Gen AI services that we announced for digital experience, it comes at a time when marketing is going through a big shift from sort of mass marketing to personalized marketing at scale. For that personalization at scale, everything has to be personalized, whether it's content, audiences, or customer journeys. That's the unique advantage we have. We have the data within the Adobe Experience Platform with the real-time customer profiles. We then have the models that we're working with, like Firefly. We have the interfaces through the apps, like Adobe Campaign, Adobe Experience Manager, and so on.\nWe can put all of that together in a manner that's really consistent with the data governance that customers expect, so that their data is used only in their context and use that to do personalized marketing at scale. It really fits very well together.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nMaybe just given how much excitement we have around this, Kirk, three quick things. The first is it really allows for us to, within a company, have every marketer participate in the production and delivery of content, so agility for an enterprise is great. A second thing, maybe I'll add to what both Anil and David said. We can now create custom models. Think of it if you're a company like Coke or a company like Disney and you want to create these campaigns where you want to try out different things. The Firefly model can be customized for them. That, in conjunction with what we have with Express and AEM, really allows it to be tailored for that particular company. I also wanted to just clarify that that entire go-to-market is completely aligned already within the company.\nWe have one enterprise sales force calling on them across Express, Creative Cloud, as well as Experience Cloud Solutions.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nArsenije Matovic\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi guys. This is Arsenije on for Alex Zukin. Alex is trying right now, but he says it's good to see who the true AI winners are. Now to my question. The DM business continues to outperform in an impressive way. Can you talk to some of the underlying levers in stack rank? What is driving the strength, whether it's demand for content, uptake of newer products, or cross-selling success? Can you help unpack the layers of success you are seeing? Just on Gen AI, you have announced new offerings with Generative Fill and more recently Generative Recolor. As we are seeing kind of the traction you are getting online within the creative community, how is it helping inform you about where the greatest monetization opportunity is? Thank you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nSure. Yeah. First of all, thanks for the question. Yeah, we feel like we're off to a great start for the first half of the year. As we look at it, the strength was very broad-based. Traffic to adobe.com and top-of-funnel was strong, frankly, all quarter long. It's clear that our messaging is resonating well with a broader and broader set of audiences that we can reach. Second, we saw strong conversion. Our product-led growth investments that we've been making for some time now are starting to pay dividends. Adobe.com is an area we've focused for a long time. We continue to see improvements in terms of customer journey work and conversion. We've more recently been investing much more significantly in product-led growth motions in our core flagship applications like Photoshop and Acrobat as well.\nWe've been leveraging a lot of Anil's digital experience products that allow us to do personalization at scale in terms of in-product experiences there. Lastly, it feels like we really started to see some good inflection in our mobile applications. In particular, Acrobat on mobile and Lightroom mobile performed very well this quarter as well. In addition to that, as Dan mentioned in his opening comments, the emerging products like Substance and Frame continue to grow very nicely and really sort of slipstream into the content supply chain conversation that we're having with enterprise customers. Frankly, enterprise demand for content creation continues to grow. Anil said last week at EMEA Summit that our customers are expecting it to grow 5x in terms of content creation over the next few years. We continue to see more pull for our creative apps.\nWe're starting to see enterprises invest much more in Acrobat penetration into their accounts. They really want more people to have Acrobat from Adobe. That's just to name a few things. Things are shaping up great for the year, and we're very excited about the direction of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations on the strong quarter and the updated guidance. Dan, can you give us some color on how Gen AI is going to impact margins? Especially, half a billion assets created just in the beta. The potential for substantial Gen AI once this is all launched is going to be enormous. How should we think about that?\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Mark. As I reflect on the company's journey, we've got a long history of driving strong, profitable growth. We deliver the innovation and the top-line progression, but we do it in a very disciplined way, which drives margin and cash flow for investors. I see this playing out in a similar fashion. These are real investments. They're material investments we're making to unlock the magic of the Adobe technology platform and seamlessly integrating it across the product portfolio. When we think about the cost drivers, we think about training, we think about inference, we think about storage costs. The company is ruthlessly prioritizing how we're spending and what projects we're investing in to create a spend envelope to bring this technology to life in a very rapid fashion. You can see the discipline at play. We've been at this for several quarters.\nYou see the strong print from a profitability standpoint in Q1. We followed through with a strong print again in Q2. As we look into the back part of the year, again, you're seeing second half, year-over-year, second half over second half showing an uptick from a profitability standpoint. We're going to continue to stay focused on being very disciplined, how we prioritize what we do and don't do, and make sure we create the right kind of spend envelopes for this technology as we bring it to life. I think it's an and statement for us at the company and what we've done for a very long time here. Drive innovation, drive strong top-line growth, and do it in a very profitable way that's cash flow generative and value creative for investors.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nYeah. I'll add a little bit onto that because we've been working very closely between our engineering organization and the finance organization on a number of levers to make sure that we're managing and keeping discipline and cost front of mind. The first is the model training itself. There are a number of things the team has been doing to optimize our ability to train larger models more efficiently. The second is post-training inference optimization. There's a lot of, I think, cutting-edge work coming out here, both in terms of research and the work we're doing around things like pruning, distillation, and quantization that make the inference execution much more efficient. Third is, as we've talked about in the past, we're working with folks like NVIDIA to make sure that the hardware and software advances go hand in glove.\nWe're leveraging more and more compute pathways that are on the chip itself for user experience, making sure that as we expose these things to users, we do it in a way that drives more efficiency on the back end. Of course, the big unlock longer term is about hybrid generative approaches. How do we move more of this computing to the desktop as well? That'll be a major cost benefit down the road. It's a significant effort and a lot of work to do, and we take it very seriously.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Mark, I just wanted to add, in addition to all of that great work that we're doing on saving costs, I'm more excited about the top-line growth that this is going to cause for us.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citibank.\n\nTyler Radke\n\nAnalyst, Citibank\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Document Cloud strength you saw in the quarter. The business saw a nice improvement relative to last quarter. If you could just unpack that a bit. Secondly, as I look at the full year outlook, clearly a really strong quarter, one of the biggest beats we've seen in years. As I think about Q4, just kind of the initial implied guide, is there anything to call out, any one-time factors around pricing we should keep in mind as we compare the year-over-year decline, or is that just conservatism? Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll talk about the Acrobat business, and then we can get to Q4 after that. First of all, yeah, another great quarter. It was great to see ARR growing 23%. A lot of this is the basics of PDF demand, right? We've seen this incredible tailwind with demand for PDF continuing to grow. PDF has become the de facto standard for unstructured data. PDF-related searches continue to grow. This is, as Shantanu mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 30 years after PDF launch. It's amazing to see how things are going. We've been investing very heavily in expanding our top-of-funnel. We have Acrobat Web that's been driving a lot of new users. We've seen good growth directly to Acrobat Web. Acrobat Mobile has also been a source of new opportunity for us. We talked about our extensions in Chrome and Edge.\nWe've mentioned in the past our partnership with Microsoft to really make Acrobat the foundation or PDF and Reader the foundation of all documents viewed in Edge as well. That creates an enormous top-of-funnel for us, and we continue to sort of broaden that. In addition to that, we've been adding more value directly into the products with proliferation of signatures and collaboration capabilities. All of that, combined with our product-led growth motions, is driving strong conversion. We feel really good about the foundation of that business.\n\nDaniel Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Coming to the guide, Tyler, the way I'd think about it is, if we think about the journey to date this fiscal year, we had a strong print in Q1, we had a strong print in Q2, we've got a lot of momentum around this business. As we look into the back half of the year, we see that momentum continuing. We're two weeks into Q3, we see that momentum continuing. As you would expect, we see a strong finish to the year in Q4. We've got a long track record inside of the company of setting expectations and then executing against those expectations in a way that drives value for investors. I think the setup for the back half of the year is no different than that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Matt Swanson with RBC.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question, and I'll add my congratulations on the quarter. We've kind of talked from the beginning that a major differentiation point for Firefly is that this is an enterprise-safe generative model. Could you just give us some insights into your customer conversations and really how focused enterprises are around the potential, maybe copyright or trademark issues that generative could create using other solutions?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nMatt, maybe I'll take that. It's actually been off the charts, the interest. We just had our summit in London following the successful launch that we had here, where customers, even in the US, were asking us questions. I would say there are around three areas. All of them had perhaps experimented with other solutions. The moment Adobe came in and said, this is both safe and designed for commercially safe, as well as, we can create the custom models, I think the interest associated with that has been off the charts. We've already created some custom models where we tweak our core model with assets that people can provide us. That's also a secret sauce that we're unlocking, and the integration of that within each of our products.\nFrankly, the product's not yet available, but the number of customers who want to sign on in terms of wanting to use it has been one of the most successful launches that we've had. When I say the product's not ready, all I'm saying is it's not generally available. It's certainly available for them to put through their paces within the company.\n\nMatt Swanson\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nYeah, that sounds fantastic when you get the users and the CEOs to agree on the same product. That's a good combination.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Shantanu at Summit with the content supply chain news. The company pretty much effectuated something that you've been talking about for the last number of years, that is content supply chain. The question is about the potential business impact. Could you talk about what is fundamentally new or newly required in terms of pipeline development for that broader concept of implementing Adobe product? What do you think the impact might be, for example, in your average book of business that you disclose with your top 2,500 and top 1,000 customers each year at the analyst meeting? You do seem to be investing still heavily in consulting capacity. Is that part of the development that you foresee necessary for content supply chain?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe",
    "content2": "A couple of points, Jay, and then certainly Anil can add to it. First, I think if we are a good user's case for what's happening, the reality is that with what David talked about as it relates to product-led growth, what the content supply chain really allows us to do is start with a marketing brief that we're putting within workflow, start to create the campaigns, have AEM and our asset management solution be the place where all of these assets are, and then deliver them through Campaign as well as deliver them through the Adobe Experience Manager and the website.\nI think the interest associated with this is all about trying to say, all of the content that we're creating, how do we both make that more efficient as well as understand how we can both globalize, which has been a big driver of why people want this content supply chain. The traditional agencies, I think Anil referred to this, they all have not only, I think, procured our solution for their internal usage, but they're also collectively taking this solution to joint customers. I think it actually just really beautifully aligns within Anil's enterprise sales motion, how we can go with everything from workflow, which actually had a great quarter, so we continue to see good growth in workflow. I think it aligns all of our offerings.\nThere isn't one customer that doesn't want this, partly because of all the additional cost and scrutiny on what the expenses are right now. Yeah, we are just so uniquely differentiated across the Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud. In terms of getting this implemented for customers, as you mentioned, we now have partnerships with Accenture, IBM, Omnicom, and Publicis, and all of them are working very closely with us and our field teams to make sure that the content supply chain gets implemented for every customer across different verticals and geographies, specifically for their needs.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nElizabeth Porter\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. This is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith Weiss. Congrats on the strong quarter. My question is, again, around generative AI. There's clearly a lot of investment and news across the industry. Are there generative AI capabilities that could become table stakes? What are the areas that drive real differentiation that is monetizable for Adobe? How do you see this market evolving between those two pieces over time where Adobe really solidifies its leadership? Thank you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah. I think for us, the entire generative AI really is all three layers that we talked about. If you think about our generative AI strategy, it really first starts with, do we have unique data that we can use on behalf of our customers for customers? Clearly, both in the creative, in the document space with PDF, as well as in the marketing space, the amount of data that we have is a key differentiator because that is going to dictate the models when you want to design this to be commercially safe. I think the second thing that we're really focused on is in the domains where we have incredible expertise, whether you consider it imaging, vector, documents, or marketing, we are creating our own foundational models. When you create the foundation models, you really understand how that works.\nYou understand how you can take it to an enterprise and create a custom model for that. I think the real differentiator for Adobe continues to be, how does a user get value? I think it's in the ubiquitous interfaces that we have, whether that's on the marketing side, everything where people are trying to create these campaigns, automate production, create a website, or create a mobile app. Similarly, in documents, which we haven't touched on as much today, how they get the synthesis of the PDF, how they understand the structure of the PDF. Clearly, in creative that we've seen, both with generative recolor in Adobe Illustrator as well as generative fill in Photoshop, as long as we have the interfaces that delight customers and where all this magic comes to life, that's really, I would say, Adobe's differentiator. You've seen that.\nIt's not like there weren't other imaging models out there. The fact that we've captured the imagination of the community is a result of how all three of these layers really work well for Adobe, better than anybody else.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nHey, operator, we're right at the top of the hour. Let's take one more question, and then we'll conclude.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Shantanu, a lot of questions around why won't the DX cloud give the Creative Cloud the cold as well? Why are you confident this won't spill over? Given I'm the last question, I'll break the operator's policy and ask you one for David. When you think about just the number one question we're all getting, will AI reduce the number of seats available to you? Can you just address that? That's the number one question we continue to get. Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nGreat. I'll start with the second, and we can go to the first after that. Brent, if you take a look at Adobe's history, this is what we do, right?\nIf you look at desktop publishing, if you look at creative imaging, if you look at video editing, the result of Adobe's focus here is always about increasing productivity, increasing the importance of these new workflows. That has always led to an increase in jobs. Let's take video editing as an example, right? We lowered the cost of production in video significantly with our work with Premiere, After Effects, and Audition. What that did was it increased the ability for people to create more content. They didn't create the same amount of content with fewer people. What they did was they found new business opportunities. They created more niche content that led to video streaming and personalization. That created an explosion in the industry around video production. That's what we do.\nWe're sitting at a moment where companies are telling us that there's a 5x increase in content production coming out in the next couple of years. You see a host of new media types coming out. We see the opportunity here for both seed expansion as a result of this, and also because of the value we're adding into our products themselves, increasing our pool as well. Now, beyond all of this in terms of professional video and professional content creation, I should say, there's also a massive opportunity because this catalyzes our ability much more effectively to go after the billions of creators around the world who need things like this to be creative. We're going to help them also create standout content. Again, I take a step back and I say we have an opportunity to get more people into the franchise.\nWe have the ability to drive more RPU through our products. We have the ability to make people more successful and drive more LTV. The foundation, I think, is very strong.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nBrent, if I understood the question right, I mean, the interest within the DX customer base for what we are doing on Creative Cloud, if you look at both summits, the interest associated with how these clouds and offerings are working together is actually one of the catalysts that I think will help both the digital media, as well as the digital experience business. You're right. I mean, we are finding that every customer is saying, this is the way for us to really go all the way from when we start to create a campaign all the way to the delivery and understanding the analytics associated with that. I think the enterprise team has really aligned around this joint selling, and we've created a bill of materials where you can actually have both the digital experience, as well as the Creative Cloud offerings in it.\nI think that's what you're going to see in the second half. We're going to have a lot more of these combined sales that happen with every enterprise because it helps, as we've been saying, with both the top line and the bottom line. Since it was the last question, I mean, let me end by saying it was a great first half. We appreciate all the comments that you have made about the quarter. I wanted to thank the Adobe team for real great execution, as well as, again, congratulate in particular the Acrobat team for 30 years of amazing innovation.\nWhat I'm most proud of is if you look at just the last few months in terms of what the company has delivered across Firefly, generative fill, and generative recoloring, what's happening with Acrobat across the web in digital experience, the Adobe Mix Modeler, product analytics, what we are doing around content supply chain, the new offerings that are coming for an increasing set of customers that will serve real customer problems, I think really all goes well for how we will continue to drive innovation and serve customers well. I'm really excited about the second half, as well as what we're going to continue to do in terms of delivering top line and bottom line growth. With that, I'll hand it over to Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Thanks everyone for joining the call. I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. This concludes the event.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have an excellent day."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Vaas, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Shantanu Narayen, Adobe's Chairman and CEO, David Wadhwani, President of Digital Media, Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience, and Dan Durn, Executive Vice President and CFO. On this call, which is being recorded, we will discuss Adobe's Q1 Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results. You can find our press release, as well as PDFs of our prepared remarks and financial results, on Adobe's Investor Relations website. The information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans, is as of today, 15 March, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today's press release and in Adobe's SEC filings.\nOn this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our reported results include GAAP growth rates, as well as constant currency rates. During this presentation, Adobe's executives will refer to constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations are available in our earnings release and on Adobe's Investor Relations website. Adobe Summit is just around the corner in Las Vegas at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center, beginning on Tuesday, 21 March. Following the Day one keynote, we will host a Q&A session with financial analysts and investors in attendance at 11:30AM Pacific Time. Audio of the event will be broadcast live, and the replay will be available on Adobe's IR website. More details about Summit and the agenda are available at summit.adobe.com. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had a strong Q1, driving record revenue across our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud businesses. We achieved $4.66 billion in revenue, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.71, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.80. Digital is reshaping how we connect and engage with the world around us. Our performance demonstrates the critical role that Adobe products are playing in fueling the global digital economy, empowering everyone, everywhere, to imagine, create, and bring any digital experience to life. We're executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity, and power digital businesses, delivering on our innovative product roadmap and engaging a growing universe of customers, from individuals to small businesses to the largest enterprises.\nGiven the recent news reports, I wanted to provide an update on the process and timing of our pending acquisition of Figma. We remain excited about the opportunity to advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. The potential combination continues to be well received by customers, industry analysts, and partners. In addition, we're preparing for integration as we work through the regulatory process. From the outset, we have been well prepared for all potential scenarios while realistic about the regulatory environment. We have completed the discovery phase of the US DOJ second request and are prepared for next steps, whether that is an approval or a challenge. Adobe remains confident in the facts underlying the case, and, based on current process timing, we believe the transaction continues to be on track for a close by the end of 2023.\nIt goes without saying that our Q1 success demonstrates that we continue to be ruthlessly focused on executing against our immense opportunities, independent of this combination. David, over to you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media Business, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. We're living in a visual, digital-first world where content creation and consumption are exploding, and where consumers, students, and businesses need to create content that stands out and elevates their online profiles. As a result, more and more people are turning to Creative Cloud, which remains a preeminent destination for creativity across imaging, design, video, illustration, and animation, as well as new media types like 3D and augmented reality. We continue to see strong demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat, and are excited about the traction we're getting with Adobe Express. Q1 was a strong quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new creative ARR of $307 million and revenue of $2.76 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year.\nQ1 highlights include strong growth in top-of-funnel traffic, which resulted in healthy new demand for Creative Cloud applications across all routes to market and customer segments globally, from individuals to SMBs to large enterprises. Increased demand and mobile adoption in imaging with products like Photoshop and Lightroom. Lightroom Mobile is now the default photo editor for the high-end photo editing experience on the Samsung Galaxy S23 series. Continued momentum for Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io, which are leaders in video editing and collaboration. Over two-thirds of films at Sundance, as well as Oscar winners Everything, Everywhere, All at Once, and Navalny, were edited with our video products. Rapid adoption of Substance 3D by brands such as Amazon, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton.\nThe Substance 3D team was honored with a technical Oscar in recognition of 3D capabilities that are making popular films such as Spider-Man, Star Wars, and Blade Runner 2049 possible. Acceleration in our Adobe Stock business, driven by the demand for high-quality imaging, vector, video, and 3D content. Momentum for Adobe Express with significant year-over-year growth in monthly active users across segments such as students, small businesses, and creative professionals. We are actively driving adoption of both new users and existing Creative Cloud subscribers who are now using Express when they want speed and ease, and we look forward to an imminent release of a dramatic upgrade with enhanced performance, collaboration functionality, and new authoring capabilities for video and mixed media. Exciting introduction of new products, including our beta releases of Character Animator and Adobe Podcast.\nAdobe Podcast is a web-based, AI-powered audio recording and editing app, perfect for the growing podcast industry. It makes every recording, even those done on your phone in busy spaces, sound like they were recorded in a studio. Key customer wins in the quarter include Accenture, BBC, Disney, IBM, Infosys, and Nintendo. Our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders to reimagine the future of creativity. Last October, we previewed some of Adobe's generative AI technology at Max. We have been hard at work training Adobe models on our proprietary data sets, creating APIs, envisioning new services, and integrating all these capabilities into our existing applications as a Creative Copilot. These innovations are developed and deployed in alignment with Adobe's AI ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency. Stay tuned for some exciting announcements slated for next week in conjunction with Adobe Summit.\nDigital documents are powering productivity at home and at work, whether users are filing a tax form, submitting a sales contract, requesting feedback on a marketing campaign, or completing an online bank transaction. Adobe Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan, and sign documents across desktop, web, and mobile. In Q1, Document Cloud had record revenue of $634 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth and strong net new ARR of $103 million, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 highlights include continued demand for PDF, with outstanding growth in documents opened in the Acrobat Chrome extension, and a new integration that will make Acrobat Reader the default PDF viewer in Microsoft Edge for over a billion Windows users.\nSignificant growth in monthly active users for Acrobat Web, driven by search volume for PDF-related verbs and a continually optimized funnel to our web offering. Continued proliferation of Acrobat, driven by demand for integrated functionality such as Share for Review for collaboration, and Adobe Sign for e-signatures. Outstanding increase in API transactions as our ecosystem and business customers continue to customize and integrate document services. Strong demand across all routes to market and customer segments globally, from individuals to SMBs to large enterprises. Key customer wins include Bank of Montreal, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Ministry of Defense of Netherlands, Samsung, and Verizon. Given the strong Q1, the demand for our products, and our innovation roadmap, we're pleased to raise our FY 2023 digital media net new ARR target. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience Business, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. During the 2022 holiday season, e-commerce drove a record $211 billion, with 38 days of $3-plus billion in daily spend, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. Companies across B2B and B2C need an integrated customer experience management platform that empowers them to anticipate and meet the expectations of their customers. Today, digital is especially critical in enabling companies to drive profitable growth by delivering engaging and efficient customer experiences across the entire funnel, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to power experience-led growth. Experience Cloud offers a comprehensive portfolio of products that span the entire experience lifecycle, from marketing planning and workflows, to data insights and activation, to content and commerce, and customer journeys. Built natively on Adobe Experience Platform, our real-time CDP provides businesses with actionable customer profiles, leveraging data from online and offline channels to deliver personalized experiences at scale.\nIn Q1, we continue to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.18 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.04 billion, both representing 14% year-over-year growth. Petco is a great example of a B2C company leveraging Adobe's comprehensive set of products to create and deliver engaging experiences. Petco uses Creative Cloud to create content, and Experience Cloud, including real-time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer, to orchestrate personalized experiences across their pet care ecosystem, including veterinary care, grooming, training, and insurance. On the B2B side, Qualcomm is harnessing Experience Cloud to deliver personalized experiences and improve marketing performance, as well as Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to accelerate content velocity across its business lines. Additional Q1 highlights include high retention rates and strong demand for services, demonstrating our customers' focus on long-term value realization.\nStrong growth in Adobe Experience Platform and our native applications, inclusive of real-time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and customer journey analytics. Momentum for Workfront, which is powering workflows to help teams around the globe collaborate and launch campaigns with ease and efficiency. Significant wins over single product competitors in analytics, content management, and CDP that underscore Adobe's differentiation. Leadership in industry analyst reports, including the Forrester Wave for digital intelligence platforms, the Forrester Wave for cross-channel marketing hubs, and Gartner's Magic Quadrant for digital experience platforms. A significant number of transformational deals, including Accenture, Carnival AIDA, Costco, IBM, MetLife, Paramount, Pfizer, S&P Global, TD Bank, and Tim Hortons. The digital experience business had a strong start to the year. Enterprises are focused on driving revenue growth through digital channels while increasing the productivity of their investments in customer experience and marketing.\nExperience Cloud is uniquely positioned to help enterprise customers across the world unlock profitable growth. Next week, we are excited to host Adobe Summit, the world's largest digital experience conference. It's our first time coming together in person in Las Vegas since 2019, and we'll be joined online by tens of thousands of customers, partners, and developers from around the world. In addition to unveiling exciting new technology innovation across Experience Cloud, we will host inspirational C-level executives from several companies at the forefront of the digital economy. I'll now pass it to Dan.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q1, fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Q1 was a strong start to the year for Adobe. I know the macro economy is on every investor's mind right now, and you can see the resilience and diversification of Adobe's business in our financial results. Businesses today are prioritizing investments in order to maximize returns and impact, both to drive their top line and to deliver operational efficiency. Individuals are looking to create content that enables them to connect and stand out across digital platforms. In this environment, the demand for our products continues to be strong as our solutions are mission-critical to customers in a world where digital content and engagement drive the global economy. Our product differentiation, engine of innovation, and data-driven operating model are continuing to drive Adobe's growth.\nWe have a world-class balance sheet, industry-leading margins, a strong cash flow profile, and a proven track record. I can't think of a company that's better positioned as we continue to innovate in our core business, and create and scale emerging businesses to drive profitable growth. In Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.66 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $2.71, and non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $3.80, digital media revenue of $3.40 billion, net new digital media ARR of $410 million, digital experience revenue of $1.18 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.69 billion, RPO of $15.21 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock during the quarter.\nIn our digital media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $3.40 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.67 billion of digital media ARR. We achieved creative revenue of $2.76 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency, and we added $307 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter.\nQ1 creative growth drivers included new user growth fueled by customer demand and targeted marketing campaigns, which drove increased web traffic in the quarter, adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments and geographies, students graduating from our education segment into the creative professional job market, continued strength in upselling our new Acrobat CC offering, which includes integrated sign capabilities, licensing of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings, momentum in high-growth businesses such as Substance and Stock, where we had a tremendous quarter generating new business, and with Frame, which we are successfully cross-selling into our video customer base, and a fast start to the year selling into our large enterprise accounts. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $634 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 16% in constant currency.\nWe added $103 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Q1 Document Cloud growth drivers included continued growth of Acrobat Web, demonstrating the success of our product-led growth strategy, strength in conversion and retention rates of our Acrobat mobile customers, demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments, success generating new customer demand for Acrobat Sign and SMB in the mid-market, and strength in the enterprise, driving seed expansion for our Acrobat business. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.18 billion and subscription revenue of $1.04 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency.\nQ1 digital experience growth drivers included success closing numerous transformational deals with large enterprises that are choosing Adobe to be their end-to-end CXM platform to drive personalization at scale, momentum with our AEP and native applications, with the book of business growing more than 50% year-over-year, strength with our content and Workfront solutions as our content supply chain strategy is resonating with customers, renewal rates of our enterprise customers that continue to be strong, and sales execution across multiple geographies. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet, in Q1, we continued with our strategy of making disciplined investments to drive growth while identifying cost-saving opportunities to drive earnings. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations.\nFor fiscal 2023, Adobe's management is adopting a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate to assess and report on operating results, which we believe provides a clear view of Adobe's financial performance. The fixed long-term non-GAAP rate considers our current operating structure, existing tax positions, legislation, and available forecast information. This rate is based on a three-year projection and may be adjusted for changes in the future. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.21 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, or 13% when factoring in a 3 percentage point FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $5.65 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.69 billion. Over the past year, we completed a thorough review of our short-term investments and marketable securities to ensure we are prepared for the current environment, and with a bias towards the higher end of the investment-grade spectrum.\nAdobe does not hold substantial assets or securities at Silicon Valley Bank or any regional bank. In Q1, we entered into a $1.4 billion share purchase agreement, and we currently have $5.2 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through the end of fiscal 2024.\nIn light of the strong start to the year and momentum across our business, and factoring in the macroeconomic environment, for Q2, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $4.75 to 4.78 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately $420 million, digital media segment revenue of $3.45 to 3.47 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $1.21 to 1.23 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of $1.06 to 1.08 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.65 to 2.70, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to 3.80. As a result of the strong performance in Q1 and trajectory of the business, we are raising our fiscal 2023 net new ARR and EPS targets.\nFor fiscal 2023, we are now targeting digital media net new ARR of approximately $1.70 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $10.85 to $11.15, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.30 to $15.60. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution in Q1, demonstrating the momentum we've established for the year. Our strong engine of innovation, combined with our operational rigor, are driving profitable growth, and position us well to capture the massive growth opportunities at our doorstep. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan. Adobe's Q1 results underscore our strong momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our businesses. We're thrilled to be back in Las Vegas for Adobe Summit next week. In addition to unveiling several new innovations across Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud, we will share how we are building on our decades of AI leadership to deliver generative AI technologies that redefine creativity and customer experiences. We look forward to seeing you there. Adobe's employees around the world motivate us to continuously raise the bar and create the future. This quarter, we were named to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for the fifth year in a row, and the CDP A-list, which recognizes leadership and environmental impact. Our renowned brand, mission-critical products, and vast base of customers create an unmatched advantage that will fuel our growth.\nThank you, and we will now take questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, press star one to ask a question. Please limit yourselves to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. We'll take our first question from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on a really strong start to the year. Dan, your guidance explicitly embeds assumptions for the macro environment. Can you share with us what those are, and how those assumptions might have changed from a few months ago when you last guided? Thanks.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Thanks, Brad. There's really no change in our view in the macro environment. I think we were pretty clear at the time we set our annual guidance, the environment that we're in. We see the environment that others see. I think you can see that the company is performing really well against that backdrop. We feel good about how we're situated, the way in which we're engaging with customers, and its broad, diversified performance across that environment. We like how we're set up, but there's really no change to the assumptions underlying the macro environment. We see the same environment that others do.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Maybe just what do you think is the driving force behind it? So many companies are talking about longer sales cycles, difficulty closing business. You had an outstanding quarter, specifically within the enterprise. Maybe what's driving those macro headwinds for others that you're not seeing, or your resiliency specifically? On the topic of metrics, every metric was strong that we looked at: revenues, RPO, digital media ARR, operating margins. Maybe just can you talk about deferred revenue in the quarter? Anything there that was a headwind? It did look like free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nI'll take the first, Alex, and then maybe Dan can speak to the second. I mean, I think, as Dan said, when we look at the macroeconomic situation, you can see strong companies actually refer to this across the board, whether it's consumers, small and medium businesses, or enterprises globally. I think the reality is that digital for them is an imperative, and really for companies that have innovative solutions, it is a tailwind. I think what a lot of companies are focused on, the message that enterprises are certainly sharing, is that if the prior focus was growth at any cost, they are certainly looking for more profitable growth. I think if you look at our solutions on the creative, document, or enterprise side, we help them. We help them with growth, but we help them with profitable growth and engaging with customers.\nThe second thing I would say is that there's a large dam here. I think our job in this environment is making sure that we have an even larger pipeline that we go address and attract because there may be some difference in the closure rates. I think if you look at it in aggregate, our job is looking at it and saying, how do we differentiate ourselves? I think the one thing also I would say, Alex, is that a lot of the companies that have single product offerings, I think they are probably seeing more headwind because a certain company may not put one part of what they offer as a priority.\nI think a lot of the companies are looking at it and saying, if we're engaging in digital, we might change our focus from content management to the implementation of the customer data platform, or there might be a focus more on campaigns or ensuring that the advertising spend, the attribution associated with it. I think the team's executed against continuing to try and drive a large opportunity. The other thing I think we feel good about is the fact that both Summit as well as in the US and UK, we're looking forward to being in person because we can engage more in person with them. Hopefully that gives you some color of why perhaps the stronger companies are showing more macro strength than other companies.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nAlex, I'll jump in on the second part of the question. As we think about RPO being up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, you think about the underlying performance, deferred revenue, unbilled backlog. It's a very similar profile across both of those dimensions of the RPO. If you think about cash flow, the one thing I would point to, we all know that there's been a change in the tax regulation around capitalization of R&D expenses. We signaled at the time we set our annual targets that we would see a step up in cash taxes starting this quarter. That's really what you see profiling through operating cash.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the star key followed by the digit two. We'll take our next question from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Really nice quarter. I think my question is actually a deep dive into the prior two questions. Dan, maybe digging a little bit into sort of what Brad was asking. We are, from a market perspective and investor perspective, worrying about these kind of incremental impacts like Silicon Valley Bank and other bank failures. You're seeing continued reduction in headcount from big shops like Meta on a go-forward basis. I think the market is getting incrementally worried about the underlying kind of macro impacts. You guys went the other way. In Q1, you're taking up your net new ARR additions for digital media.\nCan you walk us through specifically, is there anything mechanical or sort of tactical, if you will, that gives you guys the confidence that even with the heightened kind of volatility that we're seeing out there, you guys feel comfortable in a Q1 taking up that full year guide? On the other side of the equation, on the free cash flow, can you just specify for us and give us a sense of kind of where those cash taxes are going to go over time just to help us kind of tune in our model?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Let me take them in reverse order. In terms of cash taxes, there's a five-year amortization period around the capitalization of that R&D. You'll see a pretty dramatic cash tax step up initially, but over that five-year amortization period, it'll converge on the reported tax rate. That's the general profile, and it's why you see the significant step up in Q1. It's just starting that process now. In terms of the environment we're in, clearly the company is performing well. You see the diversification of our business that's across geographies, industry sectors, and product portfolio. The company's just performing well in a broad-based way.\nOn the strength of that performance and the momentum we have, the visibility we have into the full year, we think it's the prudent thing to set expectations with investors in a way that reflects what we see as the opportunity and the company-specific performance. When I take a step back and I think about what is driving that differential performance in this environment, I think our products are mission-critical to our customers. We are on the critical path of them generating revenue. As the world goes digital and those investments are prioritized, not only do we help companies drive top-line growth, but we help them with the underlying productivity gains that go with that. It is why customers in this environment are prioritizing around things that we sell to enable their success. It addresses top-line performance as well as underlying profitability of our customers.\nBeing on the critical path, being mission-critical to customers, we think this is the type of environment where the power of Adobe and the performance of the company gets to shine.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media Business, Adobe\n\nYeah. I'll just add a little bit specific to digital media. The foundation of the growth that we have, we still feel a very significant tailwind even in this market. Shantanu talked about the strength of the enterprise business. Every business needs to be a digital business. Digital content is fueling the global economy. That's true for smaller organizations and individuals as well. If you look at the creator economy, we're seeing more people come in to start to create their own personal online brands. We saw a very strong digital funnel as well. We had the highest traffic that we've ever had come to adobe.com. Even in small, medium businesses, the part of their business that they need to invest most in is the digital channel, as Dan was talking about.\nYou look at that diversity, you then layer on the diversity of the growth drivers that we have in the business, whether it's new user acquisition, upsell of existing users, retention rates, new businesses like Substance or Stock, or the pricing and packaging opportunities that we have. Every one of those levers has been very productive for us. In terms of primary growth driver, it is and always has been new user acquisition. It is by far the biggest contributor. A lot of the PLG work that we've done over the last year, year and a half, is contributing to not just top-of-funnel, but also conversion of that top-of-funnel. In terms of upsell and migration, we've been investing for a decade or more in education.\nWe have a very efficient channel now where students that graduate effectively upgrade and migrate into full-priced offerings. That drove a very strong Creative Cloud individual all-apps quarter for us. Retention, we've been doing a lot of work in retention through PLG, but we've also been driving a lot of utilization of Adobe Express as part of the Creative Cloud business. All of that combined makes for a very strong retention rate. New businesses, we talked about Substance and Frame having outsized growth. Of course, the pricing and packaging work that we've been doing all along continues to contribute to that, both for CC and Acrobat CCDC as a whole. Looking ahead, all of these drivers and these levers are intact, and we have lots of opportunities going forward as well.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nMaybe just putting it all together, Keith, if you look at it and say that, hey, we did $410 million in Q1, we're targeting $420 million of net new ARR in Q2. The question you would have asked us if we hadn't done this was, what are you signaling about the second half of the year? I think it's a way of showing that the momentum is there in the business.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from the line of Drake Robert with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (William Blair)\n\nAnalyst, William Blair\n\nHey, congrats on the great results. Just want to double-click on that retention commentary you said. You called it out in several areas of the business during the prepared remarks. Is there anything specific that you're doing differently in this period of macro uncertainty that's driving those results? Have you started to see Express help at all with retention metrics as customers now of a tier that they can actually graduate down to?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, for a couple of years right now, we've been really focused on what we've called in the past the data-driven operating model, and really being pretty focused on driving the business both with the narrative and the number. I think as we continue to, as David mentioned, have different products, and he's really focused on how are we acquiring them, how are we engaging them, what's the usage, how do we make sure they're getting value for the product, how do we continuously tell them about what's new. I think as David has come in and introduced the notion of product PLG, that part has also really started to reflect in making sure that customers know that we're building products and features that are relevant for the pain points that they have.\nI would say the underlying business, while they are sort of the digital imperative, I wouldn't underestimate the incredible execution that the team continues to do on that or in DX. I mean, how do you look at the solutions we're selling? How do you understand cross-sell? How do you understand upsell? I think the hours and hours of work that goes in is sometimes not appreciated. I'm incredibly respectful and appreciative of what the teams have done. A lot of execution is, I think, the short answer.\n\n[Analyst] (William Blair)\n\nAnalyst, William Blair\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you so much. I wanted to ask about that top-of-funnel activity that you've been generating here with Communicator and the consumer segment with Creative Cloud Express, the success you're seeing there, some exciting new announcements coming here, it sounds like, on Creative Cloud Express enhancements here. Could we interpret that to mean that perhaps you're pivoting more towards upselling those customers to some of these newer features and offerings that are coming with Creative Cloud Express, away from that top-of-funnel activity that you've been very successful with so far? Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media Business, Adobe\n\nYeah. As Shantanu talked about, it's a holistic process. First of all, we've, over the last couple of years, spent a lot of time with product-led growth. What that gives us is confidence that when people come to adobe.com and they get into the products, they're going to have a great onboarding experience. They're more likely to convert, and they're more likely to stay, which then starts to give us more confidence and growth in terms of improving what has already been a world-class in terms of lifetime value. As that happens, we've been running more targeted campaigns with things for Photoshop, Acrobat, and Illustrator as an example that are more targeted to the growth activities and the landing pages in the products themselves. We've actually been connecting all of our outbound marketing activities with landing pages in the products themselves.\nWe have been able to really increase our demand efforts and the ROI associated with that to bring more traffic to top-of-funnel. In addition to that, we have been investing a lot in growth loops. People are able to now, when using the products, actually share some of the content out to stakeholders. Those stakeholders are able to look at that content, but also become top-of-funnel opportunity for us. If you look at Acrobat Web as an example, we've seen a massive increase in terms of Acrobat Web usage driven by things like Share for Review. That drives more top-of-funnel for us. Third is partnerships. We've been working very closely with Microsoft as an example. We've announced that Reader, as an example, will be the default PDF viewer in Edge, which now gives us access to over a billion users on Windows-based devices.\nIt's a cacophony of these activities that ultimately results in strong top-of-funnel. As we talked about, it's really about the hard work and the data to drive personalized experiences at scale, leveraging a lot of Anil's DX business as a product to drive users all the way through to conversion.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nWonderful to hear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGreat, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. One of the things that stood out is you mentioned wins over single product competitors in a few key areas on the digital experience side. Can we go a bit deeper into that as this environment and some of what's happening on the private company side, maybe presenting opportunities you're now able to take advantage of? I'd just be curious to hear a bit more on maybe both the DX and DM side, just on what's happening there. Thank you.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience Business, Adobe\n\nLet me start on the digital experience side. We have a broad and comprehensive portfolio, and it's integrated with the Adobe Experience Platform. From a customer perspective, they get the best of both worlds. They get those best-in-class applications, whether it's content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights, or marketing workflow. They get the benefit of integration with the Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps that we've built there. That's a powerful combination. It helps to really address what Shantanu was talking about, which is how do you keep growing through your digital channels and you get the revenue growth, but you also get the benefit of getting efficiency through consolidation. That's where we believe we really shine as customers are looking at their overall stack, similar to what they've done in other aspects of their IT enterprise architecture.\nThey're looking at who is my go-to platform that I can really standardize on, and I'll build around. We are getting the benefit of that choice.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media Business, Adobe\n\nOn the DME side, we look at just all the energy in the market around single product players, whether it's a mobile app, whether it's a web app, or whether it's this incredible excitement that we have as well around generative AI, really as focused on driving top-of-funnel because it's driving a lot of awareness of creativity and the things that people want to do. Ultimately, as they leverage those apps, as they see themselves as more creative, they inevitably end up at our doorstep going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. I just want to pick up where I think David talked about the excitement with generative AI. Anybody that wants to jump in, what does this mean for Adobe? Is this just somewhat substitutive for all the opportunity that you have, or is it somewhat incremental, or massively incremental? How does Adobe monetize generative AI at a high level? Is this something that you can create a separate SKU or charge more? I'm curious to get your thoughts quantitatively and qualitatively. Thank you so much.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nCash, I think there was about three or four questions, all related. Happy to take those really quickly.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nExactly.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nNicely played. First of all, this is really about increasing the total number of users, we believe very strongly. As we talked about at MAX, this is about enhancing human creativity, not replacing it. Ultimately, whether you're an individual solopreneur, SMB, or enterprise, we're hearing the same thing, which is that you need to create more content than you're able to create today. This really plays well into our core strengths. As you know, we've got a decades-long focus on AI, things like neural filters and object selection, and hundreds of other features have been based on AI for us. They've increased creativity, they've increased productivity, and they've helped people keep up with the demand for content. They've also made it easier for people to onboard into the experiences.\nWe've been able to broaden the opportunity for people to start leveraging and using our core products. We've now been able to leverage the hundreds of people that are in our resource organization and really target them towards generative technology, which we believe is a huge step forward, leveraging all the work we've done, but a huge step forward going forward. We and everyone else in the industry are still in the early innings. To give you a sense of where we're going at MAX, we talked about our vision for effectively not just creating content, but really engaging and embedding it in existing workflows to create a creative copilot, we refer to it as. Since then, we've been very hard at work at creating our own model. The model that we're focused on is around output quality.\nIt's about best-of-breed generative AI, but combining that with the Adobe magic that we've talked about over the years, and all the technology we have that takes images and makes them better. The output quality, we think, is going to be differentiated. The second thing is around commercial reuse. There's a lot of complex questions here around copyrights, around diversity and inclusion, about harmful content that's being created. That's something we take very seriously, and we're embedding that into everything we do. The third thing is really about workflow integration. Creating an image is just the start. It's not the end.\nAdobe is the only player that has full end-to-end workflow, not just within the products and the tools that we have in the digital media business, but also everything that Anil is doing around the content workflow and the content supply chain out to the point of distribution. In fact, because of this, we're seeing other Gen Tech companies wanting to partner with us more and more. We feel like we're in a really advantaged position where we're going to come out with our own model, and we're going to be partnering with others to make sure that because of our distribution, and the place we play in the market, we can bring a lot of this value to actual fruition. Stay tuned. Next week at Summit, we have a lot of exciting announcements and progress to make there.\nLast to your, I think, fourth or fifth question.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMonetization.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah, monetization. We're very excited about what this means for the business. New user onboarding, we think that, again, if you can start to imagine yourself as creative by using a text prompt, we can take you through that full journey and onboard you into other Adobe offerings. It's also great for retention. We've always seen the more value that gets used in our core offerings, the better the retention rates, and the better the LTV. We think there's upsell opportunity. We do think these are distinct new packages that we can bring to market and upsell people to.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. David, for you first, when we spoke at MAX on the subject of monetization, you alluded to Adobe's plans for new pricing and packaging, and you alluded to that this evening. There was a third ingredient that you also alluded to at the time, which was segmentation, which sounded to me like something that you had success with back in the pre-CC days. Is this something that you could talk about in terms of your returning to the segmentation techniques of the past that worked rather well for the company? For Anil, it's interesting to hear the reference to your competition with single product companies. That's not a new phenomenon, of course. You've had multi-solution DX portfolio for some time. Would you say, therefore, that the wins or magnitude of the wins against single product competitors is more pronounced now?\nIt's a larger part of the DX business. Would you say that the investments that you've evidently been making over the last year in consulting capacity has been a critical enabling ingredient for the growth you're now seeing in DX?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media Business, Adobe\n\nYeah. Starting with the DME side, Jay, for broad understanding, what we talked about at Adobe Max was this recognition that since we introduced Creative Cloud 10 or 11 years ago, we have now a much more comprehensive set of capabilities, all the way from a freemium model with Adobe Express, all the way to our high-end Creative Cloud offerings, but also additional capabilities and packages beyond that, like Substance, like Frame, and like Stock, that allow people to go beyond what they can do with the core creative products. The second thing that, in addition to that expansion that's happened, is that as we've been driving more with DDOM and more with product-led growth, we are starting to automatically segment customers, not necessarily today in terms of what they buy, but how they experience the products that they're using already.\nWhat that leads to is an opportunity, and again, going back to all the levers that we have for ongoing growth, there's the opportunity to start segmenting them earlier in the purchase flow into offers and offers that meet their needs and optimize the value to the price in a way that benefits our customers and, of course, also benefits Adobe. You can expect to see us continuing to play with everything from how we get new users, how we upsell users, how we retain them, new businesses we bring in, but also pricing and packaging, to your point.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nJust to punctuate that maybe a little bit, Jay, I mean, the reality is that we actually have different pricing for different devices today, which is completely different. We have web-based pricing for people who come and experience this as a result of a web search that they've made most successfully through Acrobat Web, for example. If the question is when we had things like design collection or web collection or video collection, I mean, the reality is the CC all apps, which actually had a really good quarter, is perceived by people to be the new sort of table stakes for what is happening in creative, and we think that that's a great offering.\nAs David said, I mean, whether it's Stock or whether it is Substance and a 3D offerings, what we are doing there, those are really perceived to be the differential offerings that are personalized. For a Photoshop customer, how do we get them to use one of these other offerings? I think we've done a really good job on that particular front.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience Business, Adobe\n\nYeah. From the DX perspective, we obviously started investing in AEP five years ago. Now we have lots of examples of customers who are using some of the capabilities like the unified profile, or the real-time CDP, and the real-time performance at scale in production. From a customer's perspective, if they think about a single product, they actually know what an integrated product looks like, and they realize that that's what they would have to build together, build on their own. I think that's making the choice of going with a product from Adobe, which is already integrated, which is also best-in-class application, versus a single product where they would have to put it together. I think that's making the contrast more stark.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThere's more scrutiny, wouldn't you say, Anil, that so I think part of what's happening is as the IT or the Chief Marketing Officer or the Chief Digital Officer is thinking about this holistically, there's more scrutiny around who is the company that can provide us the more comprehensive solution. You have seen, Jay, a certain difference in how customers are viewing that, which again plays to our strengths.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nManaging Director, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here, and well done on the quarter as well. I'd love to dig into Figma a little bit, understanding very well that it's still in process. David, maybe for you, I know you and the team see the opportunities with products like FigJam in really complementing Creative Cloud. I was wondering if you've seen other opportunities for some of that complementary sort of opportunity as you've spent more time with the business. Dan, maybe just quick housekeeping question. Can you just remind us sort of what the revenue overlap looks like with Figma? I believe it's the Adobe XD product specifically where there's overlap, but maybe you could just remind us sort of what that revenue overlap looks like.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Saket, maybe I'll first jump in. I mean, I think just let's remember before they answer, these are two separate companies. We are operating at arm's length in terms of what they are doing. I think we've shared upfront that the XD revenue is de minimis. That's the part that I wanted to get across. David can certainly speak to some of the strategic rationale and ideas for what we can do.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media Business, Adobe\n\nYeah. I think there's a ton of opportunity in terms of how we look at the Figma business and Figma opportunity. First of all, as we've discussed, we believe that we can just fundamentally accelerate what they are doing today in product design. We have a global footprint, working with a lot of our enterprise customers across the globe. The feedback that we're getting from these enterprise customers is a lot of excitement about the kinds of things we can do by bringing these two companies together to just accelerate, make them more productive in terms of what they want to accomplish, and just accelerate everything that they're doing.\nThe second thing is around taking workflows between Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma, and really just operationalizing them in a way that we can bring real-time collaboration capabilities based on the Figma platform to the core disciplines like illustration, video editing, photography, 3D design, and more. The third is really around the evolution with FigJam, bringing that into the core for productivity use cases. Taking FigJam and integrating it more deeply with things like Acrobat, and starting to just recognize that creativity is starting to be the foundation of how new productivity applications need to present themselves. That whole motion of enabling productivity workers to express themselves creatively is where the market's going with the rise of the creator economy. We just see a ton of opportunities to integrate the products.\nWe're limited in what we can talk to them about in the moment, but what I can say is everyone from Adobe employees to Figma employees, to our customers, can't wait for this to close so we can actually get moving on all this.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nHey, operator, we're just about at the top of the hour. We'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nOn the DX business, I'm just curious if you could just give us an overview of what you're seeing there. Are you still seeing the big deals? Are you seeing a smaller number or higher number of smaller transactions? Can you just talk through the pipeline, just general kind of setup, what you're seeing in terms of the overall DX business, and how customers are behaving?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nHappy to, Brent, and I hope we get to see you next week at Summit because then you'll also get to meet a whole bunch of customers. I think, and Anil certainly feel free to add. I mean, I think we saw some really good transformational deals. I think both Dan and Anil referred to that. Companies that are looking at Adobe to help them with their entire end-to-end customer experience management, good strength there. Brent, I mean, those tend to be ones that we have worked with for many years, and some that are really looking at it as a strategic. I would say that segment, the pipeline associated with people who are looking for a comprehensive and integrated CXM solution, is pretty large.\nI think as it relates to what we call the solution-led segment as well, which is people who may have our analytic solutions and want content solutions, or those who have both of those and want Journey Optimizer or Customer Journey Analytics, or certainly the commerce solutions, that's another part of the business where we are making sure that we can upsell. I know Anil typically at every FA meeting gives you stats and metrics on how we're making progress. That is one. Given we have the customer relationship, and we have the customer engagement, and we have customer success managers, I think continuing to penetrate a customer account, that's where also we see pipeline, and that's pipeline that's driven, frankly, by us. I think in terms of the geographies, we continue to see strength in North America.\nI think when you think about EMEA, that remains an area of strength. There are some areas in Asia, some countries in Asia. Our job there really, Brent, has been how do you drive a large pipeline, understanding that there's going to be different companies that look at this differently in a specific quarter, but we are focused on the addressable market. Anil, I don't know if you have other stuff to add.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience Business, Adobe\n\nI think the only thing I would say is I think the teams that we're going to hit on at Summit, personalization at scale, content supply chain, even for customers who are starting with a single product, like that vision because they know that is what is key to driving the digital growth and driving profitable growth. Even if they're starting with one and focusing on value realization, they have their eye on a longer-term roadmap, and that benefits our relationship with them.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nBrent, the other thing I'll say, given this is the last question, is I think at Summit you'll see some of the themes. I mean, certainly content has been a theme for us for a long time. Data has been a theme for us for a long time. The focus on customer platform and CDP has been a big one. I think how this spreads its tentacles into the product and PLG, as David has said. I think we have some exciting things that we'll talk about in that particular space in AI and how AI can help. We're not just resting on what we have today as an integrated offering. We're really the innovative product roadmap across each one of our businesses, what David's been doing in creative, what's happening in documents on the web and mobile devices, and what Anil's going to show.\nI think that's also what gives us a lot of confidence that we're anticipating and solving customer problems. It was a strong start to Q1, and based on the product innovation, we really continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have at Adobe, and we look forward to seeing all of you at Summit.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining the call. Like Shantanu said, we hope to see many of you next Tuesday at Summit. I look forward to talking to many of you soon, and this concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's meeting. Thank you for your attendance, and you may now disconnect."

I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2022 was an exciting and eventful year for Adobe. We achieved record revenue of $17.61 billion, representing 15% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share was $10.10, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $13.71. We delivered record operating cash flows with a focus on profitability. Our strong performance in the uncertain macroeconomic environment underscores the resilience of our business, and the mission-critical role of our products in a digital-first world.\nOur strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity, and power digital businesses is driving momentum across every geography and customer segment, making us one of the most innovative, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We continue to execute against our product roadmap, serve a vast customer universe from individuals to large enterprises, and deliver strong top and bottom-line growth. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of Digital Experiences, starting with the first creative spark to the creation and development of all content and media, to the personalized delivery across every channel. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $4.53 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth. In our Digital Media business, we had our best quarter ever on net new ARR, delivering $576 million, and our Digital Experience business achieved its first billion-dollar subscription revenue quarter, growing 16% year-over-year. I will now pass it to David.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nThanks, Shantanu, and hello, everyone. The demand for digital content across every creative category, customer segment, and media type is accelerating at a rapid pace. Creative Cloud remains the leading creativity platform, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products for every discipline across imaging, photography, design, video, web, animation, and 3D. Core products such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat continue to lead their categories as we add new features and enhance their capabilities with Adobe Sensei, our AI engine. The rapid progress we're making with Adobe Express is attracting millions of new users and delivering additional value to Creative Cloud members who are also interested in lightweight, task-oriented tools. New collaboration capabilities like Share for Review are integrated directly into Creative Cloud and Document Cloud applications to enable seamless creation, sharing, and review across creative and document workflows.\nOur ongoing product innovation ensures that Adobe remains the preeminent destination for a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small business owners, and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new Creative Cloud ARR of $453 million and revenue of $2.68 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. This strong performance was a result of: demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat, expansion in SMB and enterprise driven by strong execution of our year-end pipeline across direct sales and our reseller channel, accelerating growth in Substance 3D and Frame.io, underscoring the continued strength and significant opportunities in our newer businesses. Momentum in Express, our template-based web and mobile product for creating everything from year-end sales promotions to holiday cards to social media posts. Express's unparalleled collection of stock images, videos, fonts, design assets, and templates, and its unique integration of AI magic from Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat enables us to deliver the best of Adobe to customers of every skill level.\nQ4 continued to see exciting growth with millions of monthly active users, greater than 40% quarter-over-quarter visitor growth in the US, and an NPS greater than 50. Key customer wins include Electronic Arts, Meta, NBCUniversal, Publicis, Roku, Target, and United Nations. In October, we were thrilled to be back live with thousands of members from our creative community at Adobe MAX. The conference has always been an opportunity to showcase our incredible innovation, and we drove over a quarter of a billion video views across all channels. Our announcements included: powerful new AI capabilities in Photoshop, such as a one-click delete and fill tool to remove and replace objects, and a new photo restoration neural filter that instantly fixes damaged photos; a Share for Review service in Photoshop and Illustrator that enables designers to easily collaborate with key stakeholders; the first-to-market camera-to-cloud integration between Frame.io and RED Digital Camera and Fujifilm, significantly reducing production costs and time; advances in Substance 3D that empower brands such as Electronic Arts, Hugo Boss, NASCAR, NVIDIA, and The Coca-Cola Company to create engaging, immersive experiences, a new partnership between the Content Authenticity Initiative and Leica and Nikon to implement provenance technology into cameras, allowing photographers to embed when, where, and how images were captured, and early demonstrations of Adobe's Generative AI technology integrated into our tools, which promises to transform the creative process, making it more accessible, fast, and efficient than ever before.\nNow turning to the Document Cloud business, digital documents have become synonymous with productivity in our personal and professional lives, whether it's an offer to purchase a new home, a bank deposit form, a school permission slip, or a sales contract. Document Cloud is the leader in digital documents, offering innovative solutions across every device, and for every skill level. Our strategy to enable all common document actions, including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning, and signing across desktop, mobile, and web, is paying strong dividends. In Q4, Document Cloud had record revenue of $619 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth, and strong net new ARR of $123 million, with ending ARR growing 23% year-over-year.\nQ4 highlights include new Acrobat functionality for SMBs, including the ability to send branded agreement templates and combine payments with e-signed documents; new capabilities between Document Cloud and Creative Cloud to help knowledge workers and creative professionals seamlessly collaborate and improve their productivity; scan innovation that allows users to simultaneously scan the left and right pages of a book, as well as scan both sides of an ID card on one page; strong organic growth in both traffic and searches for PDF capabilities, which serve as a critical funnel to Acrobat Web, significant growth in signed transactions within Acrobat, underscoring the need for integrated document solutions; outstanding growth in API transactions. API calls nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the strategic necessity of integrating PDF capabilities within enterprise applications. Key customer wins include BioNTech, Cigna, Deloitte, Mitsubishi Electric, Raytheon, Shell Information Technology, and the US Department of State.\nQ4 was the strongest net new ARR quarter ever for Digital Media, driven by outstanding execution against multiple growth drivers in our core business. In addition, we're excited about the pending Figma acquisition, which represents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate the future of creativity and productivity for millions of people. Overall, the regulatory process is proceeding as expected. The transaction is being reviewed globally, including by the Department of Justice and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. We are currently engaged in the DOJ's second request process. We expect that the transaction will also be reviewed in the EU.\nWe continue to feel positive about the facts underlying the transaction and expect to receive approval to close the transaction in 2023. I'll now pass it to Anil.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone. Every business in every category now depends on digital to engage and transact with their customers. Adobe's holiday shopping report, which analyzes trillions of data points in Adobe Analytics, found that Cyber Monday drove an all-time high of $11.3 billion in online spending, with mobile shopping now accounting for 55% of sales on Thanksgiving, and buy now, pay later orders jumping 85% during Cyber Week. We predict spend will exceed $210 billion this holiday season. No company is better positioned than Adobe to capitalize on this large global opportunity.\nIn my customer conversations, it's clear that the current macroeconomic climate requires businesses to prioritize investments, and digital remains mission-critical to drive operational efficiency, improve customer engagement, and maximize long-term value realization. We are driving a mix of diversified revenue streams through subscription and consulting services across new and existing customers, demonstrating the strength of our business. Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses in every industry across B2B and B2C with our leading solutions spanning data insights and audiences, content and commerce, customer journeys, and marketing workflow. It is unique in that it helps businesses drive customer demand, engagement, and growth while simultaneously delivering productivity gains. Our comprehensive set of applications, including Real-Time CDP, are built natively on our highly differentiated Adobe Experience Platform, providing companies with a unified profile of each of their customers to deliver the most personalized real-time experiences at scale. Adobe Experience Platform processes 29 trillion segment evaluations per day and executes a response time of less than 250 milliseconds, illustrating the impact of its real-time capabilities at scale.\nIn Q4, we continue to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.15 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.01 billion, our first billion-dollar quarter, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Adobe is differentiated in our ability to power the entire customer experience, from ideation to content creation, to personalized delivery, to monetization. Chipotle is a great example. They're using Creative Cloud to design content for web and mobile channels, and Experience Cloud to highlight new product offerings based on consumer preferences and support a faster, easier, and more customized online ordering process. In government, the state of Illinois is using Experience Cloud and Document Cloud to provide simpler and more equitable access to state services for over 12 million residents.\nIt's especially inspiring to witness the positive social impact of Adobe technology. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has long used Photoshop to create age-progressed photos and now uses Experience Cloud to facilitate the recovery of missing children. Additional Q4 highlights include strong demand for Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, inclusive of Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics, which are rapidly becoming the digital underpinning of large brands globally. Accelerating demand for Adobe Experience Manager demonstrates Adobe's role in helping businesses effectively manage their content supply chain from creation to monetization. A new Marketing Mix Modeling service as part of our Data Insights and Audiences offering enables marketers to harness the power of Adobe Sensei to assess marketing ROI in weeks rather than months and forecast resources for campaigns more effectively. Strong growth in partner and Adobe professional services underscores our customers' continued focus on implementation and value realization.\nKey customer wins include BlackRock, Chipotle, Delta Airlines, DFS Group, Disney Parks, Elevance Health, GM, Office Depot, Publicis, Santander, and Wells Fargo. Adobe continued to receive strong industry analyst recognition, including leadership in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for B2B Marketing Automation Platforms, the Forrester Wave for Collaborative Work Management, and the Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Suites. I'll now pass it over to Dan.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2022 results. As you know, in 2022, we experienced significant headwinds from the strengthening of the US dollar, increased tax rates, and the impacts from the Russia-Ukraine war. Despite those headwinds in fiscal 2022, Adobe achieved record revenue of $17.61 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 15% growth in constant currency on an adjusted basis. GAAP EPS for the year was $10.10, and non-GAAP EPS was $13.71. We exceeded our initial non-GAAP EPS target for fiscal year 2022, which speaks to the discipline, strong execution, and resilient operating model of the company.\nFiscal year 2022 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $12.84 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $1.91 billion, Digital Experience revenue of $4.42 billion, cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion, RPO of $15.19 billion exiting the year, and repurchasing approximately 15.7 million shares of our stock during the year at a cost of $6.30 billion. In the Q4 of fiscal year 2022, Adobe achieved revenue of $4.53 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $2.53, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $3.60.\nQ4 business and financial highlights included; Digital Media revenue of $3.30 billion, record net new Digital Media ARR of $576 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.15 billion; record cash flows from operations of $2.33 billion; adding over $1 billion to RPO sequentially in the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $3.30 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.97 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved creative revenue of $2.68 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency, and we added $453 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter. Driving this performance was good linearity throughout the quarter, as well as strong customer purchasing during the peak holiday shopping weeks.\nQ4 Creative growth drivers included; new user growth fueled by customer demand, targeted campaigns and promotions, and year-end seasonal strength, which drove strong web traffic and conversion rates in the quarter. Adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments, from enterprise, to Team, to individual and education. Strength of the new Acrobat within our Creative Cloud offering, demonstrating the importance of digital documents and workflows to the creative community; sales of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings. Continued growth of newer businesses, including Express, Substance, Frame, and Stock, and a solid finish to the year in SMB and enterprise. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $619 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth or 19% in constant currency. We added $123 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter.\nQ4 Document Cloud growth drivers included; Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments. Continued growth of Acrobat Web fueled by online searches for PDF and product-led growth. Strong performance of our new Acrobat offering integrated with Sign, driving upsell ARR, as well as new customer adoption and year-end seasonal strength in SMB, including through our reseller channel. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q4, we achieved revenue of $1.15 billion and subscription revenue of $1.01 billion, both of which represent 14% year-over-year growth, or 16% in constant currency. Q4 Digital Experience growth drivers included; expected year-end strength, with significant bookings of our newer offerings in EMEA, that builds on our momentum in North America. Success closing numerous transformational deals that span our portfolio of solutions. Momentum with our Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, including Real-Time CDP.\nStrength with our Content and Workfront solutions, which are integral components of our content supply chain strategy, and increased customer demand for professional services as enterprises focus on implementation and accelerating time-to-value realization from digital investments. In Q4, we focused on making disciplined investments to drive growth and awareness of our products. We continue to have world-class growth in operating margins, and drove strong EPS performance in the quarter. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 22.5% on a GAAP basis, and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower than expected, primarily due to lower than projected tax on our foreign earnings. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.19 billion, growing 9% year-over-year, or 12% when factoring in a 3 percentage point FX headwind.\nOur ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $6.10 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were a record $2.33 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We now intend to use cash on hand to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date, which we expect will reduce our interest expense in fiscal year 2023. In Q4, we entered into a $1.75 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $6.55 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through 2024. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates.\nFX rate changes between December 2021 and this year have resulted in a $712 million decrease to the Digital Media ARR balance entering fiscal year 2023, which is now $13.26 billion after the revaluation. This is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during fiscal year 2023. We provided preliminary fiscal year 2023 targets at our Financial Analyst meeting in October that take into account the macroeconomic environment, and the growth drivers of our various businesses. While there is ongoing macro uncertainty given the massive long-term opportunity in digital, and the momentum in our business, we're pleased to reiterate those financial targets.\nIn summary, for fiscal year 2023, we're targeting: total Adobe revenue of $19.1 to 19.3 billion; Digital Media, net new ARR of approximately $1.65 billion; Digital Media segment revenue of $13.9 to 14.0 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $4.925 to 5.025 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.375 to 4.425 billion; tax rate of approximately 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $10.75 to 11.05; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.15 to 15.45. As a reminder, these targets do not contemplate our planned acquisition of Figma. We expect normal seasonality throughout the year, with Q1 being sequentially down and seasonally light for new business, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, a dip in Q3 on account of summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4.\nFor Q1 fiscal 2023, we're targeting: total Adobe revenue of $4.60 to 4.64 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $375 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.35 to 3.375 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.16 to 1.18 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.025 to 1.045 billion; tax rate of approximately 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $2.60 to 2.65; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 to 3.70. In summary, Adobe finished fiscal year 2022 strong, executing on our strategies across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. I expect this performance to carry into next year as Adobe's sustained top-line growth and world-class profitability continue to position us well for fiscal 2023 and beyond. Shantanu, back to you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nThanks, Dan. As the company celebrates its 40th anniversary, it is a perfect time to reflect on our past and our future. Adobe was founded on simple, but enduring, principles that remain with us today. Innovation is at our core. Employees are our greatest asset, and our customers, communities, and shareholders are central to our success. Over the past four decades, Adobe's continuous innovation and leadership have empowered billions of people around the globe to imagine, create, and deliver the best Digital Experiences. Our strong brand and company culture enable us to attract and retain the world's best employees.\nWe are proud to once again be named to Interbrand's Best Global Brands list as a top riser for the seventh year in a row, and to Wall Street Journal's Best Managed Companies, ranking number one for employee engagement and development. We have everything it takes to continue our success in the future: massive market opportunities, a proven ability to create and expand categories that transform markets, an expansive product portfolio that serves a growing universe of customers, revolutionary technology platforms that advance our industry leadership and competitive advantage, an expanding ecosystem that delivers even greater value to customers, strong business fundamentals, and the most dedicated and talented employees. I have never been more certain that Adobe's best days are ahead. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Press star two if your question has been answered. We do ask that you limit yourself to one question to give everyone an opportunity to ask a question. Again, it is star one if you would like to ask a question. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter and the guidance, by the way. Can you give us, David, some more color on Adobe Express and your ability to convert free users to paid users? Are you seeing any impact to creative customers trying to switch to Express? How do you assure Express paid adoption without impact on Creative Cloud?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. We're very excited about sort of the state of Express. Express just finished its first year in market. We have millions of monthly active users. As I mentioned, we saw very strong growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter with, in the US, which is our primary focus market, 40% quarter-over-quarter growth in visitors. Terrific NPS of over 50.\nThat's really on the backs of hundreds of millions of stock content that we have, the 20,000 fonts that we've added that is unique to our offering, the highest quality templates, and the constant addition of best breed features from our other Adobe products like Photoshop, Premiere, and Acrobat. We've had over 100 releases in the first year that Express has been out. We're very excited about that. The Express business itself continues to do well, both in terms of free users and in terms of conversion of those free users. To your question, we also are seeing very strong adoption of Express within our existing CC customer base. We see a lot of people, of course, buying our core flagship applications for the power and precision that they have and that they represent.\nThere are times in those users that are looking to just get something done quickly. The fact that Express is also entitled to those users gives them the ability to have the power and precision, and the speed and ease. As users are coming, we're bringing in more users than we've ever had in audiences we haven't reached by finding intent-based search for things.\nWe're bringing those users in, which is giving us incredible top-of-funnel. We're driving the conversion. We're also able to drive utilization increases in CC customers, which is driving retention of that business overall as well. The funnel and that migration of that base is very healthy and playing out as expected.\n\nMark Moerdler\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Brad Sils with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, wonderful. Thanks for taking the question here. I wanted to ask another question about Creative Cloud Express. Obviously, you're seeing some success here with that top-of-funnel business. Is there any color you can provide on where you see the upgrade path for some of those customers? Is there a certain upsell motion that we could see conversion of other products, even potentially the full suite in that install base as it's growing? Thank you.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. As we talked about when we launched Creative Cloud Express, the primary focus right now is bringing people into Adobe Express and just making them successful, whether it's at the free tier or whether it's at the paid tier, or whether it's at the paid tier, eventually migrating up into the core flagship applications. Our primary focus has been, and continues to be right now, around usage, repeat usage, and utilization. We are seeing, though, while that's our primary focus, we are seeing a lot of really interesting data coming in suggesting that the upgrade paths, while still early and not our primary focus, are working. For example, in many higher-ed institutions where we've started to deploy Adobe Express, we're starting to see not just the increase in terms of usage of Express, but we're also starting to see an increase in demand for Adobe Creative Cloud flagship applications.\nWe know and we believe that everyone should be creative, and creativity is the new productivity. As people start to leverage and benefit from that creativity, they naturally want more power and precision as well. They do go well hand in hand.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat to hear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move on to our next question from Sterling Auty with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nSterling Auty\n\nAnalyst, SVB MoffettNathanson\n\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I'm curious, is there anything operationally that you can do in preparation for the Figma acquisition, either from an expense structure or a development side now before close? If so, what are those moves that you're making?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah. Sterling, maybe I can speak to that. I mean, first, it's nice to see that since the deal was announced, the excitement associated with both what we can do as combined companies, as well as, as you can see from our results, the interest in the core business. We are excited overall associated with it. Certainly, as the regulatory bodies are looking at it, we can focus on thinking about strategically. We are getting a lot of great feedback from customers.\nThese are two separate, independent companies. As it relates to our own cost structure, as well as our technology, we feel really good about all the prioritizations we've made. We feel like we're uniquely positioned when it closes to immediately take advantage of it.\n\nSterling Auty\n\nAnalyst, SVB MoffettNathanson\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move on to our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much, guys. My congrats as well on a strong finish to the year. Following up on Sterling's question, it's good to hear the Figma close process is moving forward as expected. Can you give us an update on how their business is trending just relative to your commentary at the time the deal was announced, especially given the evolution of the macro environment since then? Thanks.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nBrad, as you know, they're a private company. We're certainly not at liberty to talk about it, and they have to continue to execute on their opportunity by themselves.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you, Shantanu.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move on to our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much. I'll add my congrats. Shantanu, the amount of energy and excitement in the audience was quite impressive down at the MAX conference. I'm wondering which of the innovations that you unveiled has created the most enthusiasm, which you think might also be monetizable. I'm wondering whether it could be generative AI, that Share for Review capability, the Intertwine capability, or anything else really coming to the forefront.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nWell, Mark, firstly, thanks for being there. It's clear that you were also looking at all of the cool, new, innovative stuff that was delivered. I always worry about questions like that because it's, which of my children do I love the most? Let me just speak to, I think, thematically what David and Scott showed, which is the core applications. We just continue to make sure the core applications are more accessible, more productive, more fun. I think that's one area, thematically, that the team has done an outstanding job of making sure that we continue to deliver innovative capabilities.\nYou mentioned Intertwine and Illustrator. I think the second thing, thematically, we talk about is how do we get more people into the franchise. David also referred to that when he answered the two questions on Express, which is the more we get people into the franchise, whether it's through our trial products, whether it's through Express, whether it's through participating in the collaborative process, I think that only adds to the available market for Adobe. I think the work that we're doing in collaboration is really continuing to democratize what we can do. I'm pretty excited about that. I think the AI and the Snyx that you talked about, that really the potential for that, when you see whether it was the individual fonts that were being done or whether your ability through a text to be able to get your content done exactly the way it is.\nI'm sure you've been tracking also what's happened, Mark, in terms of the ChatGPT and what you can do with respect to text. I think that entire space, our vision has always been anybody who has a creative idea, how do you get that creative idea to life? I think moving from the hundreds of millions to billions of people who can use it, you're right, that has profound impact in terms of getting more people on our platform. I think you'll see us be quite aggressive about delivering more of that functionality in an augmented way, perhaps first starting with Express. I think we're excited about all of that. The Frame acquisition certainly also is off.\nI think David and Dan spoke to Substance. We feel really good about the multiple growth drivers.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nWonderful. Thank you very much.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nIf I can adjust a little bit to that, the three examples you brought are really interesting examples because Intertwine is an example of the ongoing innovation in our existing flagship application. That continues to drive and keep people engaged and onboarding into the applications, and keeps everything fresh and differentiated. Share for Review, that initial release, while still early, we've been amazed by the repeat use of that once people start using it. That represents a great growth loop for us because, as you know, anyone that gets shared a document, whether it's a Photoshop document, an Illustrator document, or any other document, is also an opportunity as a stakeholder to turn into a future user of Adobe products, whether it happens to be the Photoshop document to Photoshop usage, or whether it happens to be driving people to try Adobe Express. Those growth loops are really interesting and important to us as well. I just wanted to make sure people saw that opportunity.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, David.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you. Good evening. Shantanu, I'd like to ask about a term that you use often at MAX and, in fact, a new three-letter acronym that you use as well, namely product-led growth. The question is, Adobe has arguably been a product-led growth company for the more than 30 years that I've known you. I'm wondering now, what does product-led growth mean differently today from what it might have meant historically? Relatedly, how are you thinking about the cross-sell and upsell opportunity that you also spoke about at MAX, specifically for 2023?\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nYeah, Jay, thanks for recognizing that our innovation has really come through an extremely close relationship with customers. I think in the past, in the desktop era, what product-led growth really was all about was making sure that as we engage with the customers, as we engage with the community, we were able to use that. I think the best example, perhaps, in the desktop era was what we did with Lightroom. When we first came up with Lightroom, given the fact that we had Photoshop already as a product, just getting the millions of people to use it, even before we released the product, having all those evangelists and a great product, I think, was a great example. What the team in both Creative Cloud and, frankly, in the Experience Cloud are doing is actually also following on the great work that we've pioneered in the Document Cloud. In the Document Cloud, I think product-led growth really related to, as we think about what people were doing on searches when we introduced our web-based offerings for Acrobat.\nThat's when we just started to see this velocity of how we engage with customers and prioritizing what's clearly top of mind for them. Our ability to immediately satisfy them, I think, escalated quite a bit. When David came in, David really said, we've got to take this to a whole new level with product-led growth. It's integrating both the community as well as, frankly, right now, engagement and engagement marketing in the product. When you get into product sessions right now and you see the product manager, the engineering manager, as well as the product marketing manager, all of them are on the same page. We have data.\nWe have things instrumented in the products, and your ability to do both A/B testing. Here's where we use our own products and the products that Anil does. Product-led growth right now is about saying, at any given time, we probably have three tests in market for a particular feature as well. We're using that to really learn from the customer interactions and to deliver better quality products sooner. David's really been the pioneer. David, if you'd like to add, and then maybe a little bit on what we're doing for that and Digital Experience as well.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah. Shantanu, I think that was a pretty complete summary. The only thing I would add is that there's an interesting inflection point that we are in terms of our product development cycles that give us an opportunity to take what we've always been doing, to your point, with product-led growth, and drive even more use of it, which is the introduction of all the web applications that we have. We now have Photoshop Web, Illustrator Web, Acrobat Web, and Adobe Express. You combine that with the sharing focus that we have with Share for Review as an example, and we have new growth loops that we can start optimizing. That's been a huge area of focus for the teams.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nYeah. I just wanted to add, Shantanu, as you said, several of our enterprise customers are starting to deploy their own product-led growth using our analytics technology. A banking customer, for example, one of our best customers, they have their online mortgage application. They want to track who is able to use it successfully, who's able to complete applications completely online. They're using our analytics technology to do that and see what works and what they need to do to fix it. We're starting to see, exactly as you said, our technology being both used inside Adobe to drive our own PLG, as well as customers doing it.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nJay, maybe to get to your second question and taking a step back, I do have to say, when we look at our annual targets that we had provided for Digital Media ARR at the beginning of the year, $1.9 billion. I know even with our Q4 guide, I think people had some questions about where's the momentum. I think the team crushed that, which I feel really good about. A lot of that is happening as a result of just first attracting and acquiring customers to the platform. What you're referring to is the cross-sell, upsell, whether it's people who first engage with us on a mobile device, whether it's people in Acrobat.\nWe've used Adobe Reader as a very, very good on-ramp to allow people to engage with PDF functionality and then either get a license for our Acrobat web product or for the desktop product. Individual apps, the success and the driving of individual apps, has always been an on-ramp. We then do a really good job because we use the Adobe Experience Platform to then convert them. Even promotional pricing, I know we've had some questions in the past. We have incredible data that shows us when people come in, whether that's on educational pricing and then they graduate, or on promotional pricing, converting them to customers. I think there are numerous ways in which we've demonstrated that by personalizing our offer to every creative or knowledge worker, we're able to monetize that as well after they derive the value from it.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnalyst, Griffin Securities\n\nThanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move on to Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Company\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong net new ARR customer quarter. I wanted to ask about the composition of this number. The growth dynamic between Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was a little surprising. I mean, Creative Cloud had, I think, the second strongest sequential percentage growth Q4 ever.\nLooking at Document Cloud, net new ARR didn't grow much sequentially, which is typically a stronger uptick in Q4. Can you just give a little more color on the seasonal dynamics you saw between Creative and Document Cloud in the quarter?\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nSure. Yeah, I'm happy to do that. First of all, yeah, as Shantanu mentioned, we're very pleased with how FY 2022 has gone and how the quarter closed out. We saw a lot of strength in the core businesses. Our primary focus across these businesses continues to be around new customer acquisition, new customer ads. We also have a lot of diversity in terms of the drivers that we have, and the levers we have to drive the business.\nAs we mentioned, we saw great strength across all of our creative segments, imaging, photo, video, design. We also grew a lot, focused a lot in terms of new campaigns that are targeting new audiences for Creative as well, with a new campaign called Everyone Can Photoshop that's bringing customers in directly into the products and has been very productive in terms of driving top of funnel and conversion. In terms of new businesses for Creative, we're seeing a lot of strength from new businesses like Frame.io and Substance 3D that have contributed more this quarter than ever before. To your point, we've also been seeing a lot of strength in the core business around Acrobat. We were running an Acrobat's Got It campaign really targeted at new customers and SMB, where we showed them all the capabilities that Acrobat has now, including specifically focused on signatures and things that really help them drive the business. Overall, the business is doing very well.\nThe one dynamic that, if you look at from an Acrobat perspective, that we're really proud of too is that we saw for the year, we saw growth of ARR at 23% despite the complicated macro. It's important to remember that some portion of this is also the Acrobat business is also represented in the Creative business. So the Acrobat growth number is probably a bit understated at this point.\n\nDerrick Wood\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Company\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move on to our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one on the Digital Experience side. We fielded some questions there just around guidance for next year in the current backdrop. You're holding on a target, as well, at 16% in constant currency for the quarter.\nCan you just talk more around how much visibility you have into targets there and if how you closed the year at all, particularly given that EMEA comment provides incremental confidence in those targets going forward? Thank you.\n\nAnil Chakravarthy\n\nPresident of Digital Experience, Adobe\n\nThanks for the question. We are pleased with the performance of the Digital Experience business. I mean, just as a quick reminder, at the beginning of the year, we had guided DX at 17% adjusted growth for the year, which is what we achieved in a really tough year with all the different macro issues. If I really take a step back, first of all, we're in a really strong position with our product portfolio. We have a clear lead in the market with the investments we made with the Adobe Experience Platform starting five years ago. That is really paying off with the book of business that we are seeing and all the customer adoption that we are seeing.\nWhat we are hearing from our conversations with our customers is that they're really eager to invest in a platform that enables them to meet the mission-critical priorities around digital. That's what we are enabling them at personalization in real time at scale. This is a significantly large opportunity. What we believe is that as we go through this time, single product companies are going to come under a lot of scrutiny. While we definitely see deals getting scrutinized and going up to higher levels for approval, we also see that customers really want to invest in a market leader like us for their investments that's going to last the next 10, 15 years for their digital investments. Pleased with where we are.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nMaybe Anil, I'll just add a couple of things to what you said. I mean, the first is that value realization has been top of mind for a lot of these customers. I think if you look at the business as well, the services part, it's very clear that people want to implement it. What I think is unique about Adobe's offerings in this particular space is that we help both with the customer engagement and, frankly, the top of funnel, as well as we help with productivity and cost. It doesn't matter which side of that equation you are as an enterprise. I think both of them find that the Adobe Experience Cloud, as well as, frankly, what we are doing with Sign, actually help them on both fronts.\nWe're pleased associated with that, and we have good visibility. I want to compliment Anil and his team on the execution against the pipeline and transformational deals. I think just reflect the overarching interest that people have in making sure digital continues to be an imperative. We're not going to be immune to the macroeconomic, but I like our differentiated solution and our execution.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Dan, in terms of your guide, are you implying the environment gets worse or stays the same? For Shantanu, can you just talk to me about the next six to nine months as we potentially go into a tougher economic headwind, how you're reshaping and rethinking your go-to-market, and any steps that you can take to ensure you can cut through what is coming in?\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. From a guide standpoint, we spent a lot of time talking about the environment we're in during FA Day. Against that backdrop, you can see the momentum of the business, and you can see the execution against the opportunities. What I really like about the way we're positioned in the market is there's a diversification of the company. It's end markets, it's product segments, it's business models. It gives us a resilience in the environment that we're in, and we see that in the momentum we're carrying into next year.\nThere's really no change to the view of the environment that we're in, and you see that reflected in the targets that we set for 2023. We feel good about the way we're executing against a complicated macro environment, and we'll continue to stay focused on adding value to our customers. There's a diversification and a resilience to who we are and a mission criticality of what we sell to our customers. You could see that in the comment that Shantanu made. You can see us impacting the company's top line, and you can see us impacting the productivity with which they serve their customers. That puts us in a pretty unique position.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe",
    "content2": "Brent, as it relates to your second question, I'd unpack that in maybe two ways. First, we're really pleased with what we did, and even when the pandemic first started, about prioritizing what was really critical for us. I think the prioritization exercise, when you're really focused on your top imperatives, has really helped bring clarity and alignment within the company that I don't think should be undersold in terms of how effective that has been for execution. As it relates to the next six or nine months, and you think about the three routes to market, digital continues to be an area of strength. I mean, I know through our Adobe Digital Index, we talk about what we are seeing in terms of people continuing to engage with the customers, companies that they want to transact with electronically. On the digital side, we will just continue to make sure we focus on acquiring the customers.\nDavid spoke to some of the effective campaigns. Clearly, we understand the attribution of that. We just have to remain vigilant on making sure that we're attracting the customers on the new platforms where they exist. For retention, which is a key issue as well, just how they continue to get value from the offerings that they have. The partner ecosystem, whether that's for the small and medium business, or whether that's for what we are doing with the SI and VAR community on Digital Experience, just continuing to enable them, continuing to engage with them. I think that's a part.\nClearly, the small and medium business did see a rebound after what they went through last year, which was a really bad situation. I think we have to remain vigilant on that. I think on the direct sales part, as we look at our pipeline, December, despite the fact that it's our first month of our quarter, we will continue to focus on execution against that to take advantage of whatever budget flush exists in companies. As you start to come to what happens in Japan in February, as it's the end of their fiscal year, continuing to focus on Europe. Brent, Europe was actually one of the highlights for us in the quarter. I think Adobe Experience Platform has done well. We remain cautious, clearly, about the macroeconomic, but I think we have visibility into making sure that we can continue to execute, Brent.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi. Thank you very much, and apologize in advance for some background noise. Shantanu and David, I wanted to direct this to you if I could. The ARR net new in the quarter was very good, particularly relative to expectations. If we look back over a little longer period of time, though, than the quarter, growth has slowed in net new ARR, even if it's the assumption of flattening out. What we didn't really get, I think, as much as we would have liked at the end of the day was, what do you think the key drivers of the net new ARR and creative have been or total ARR, if you want?\nWhat are the key things that you're focused on before Figma that would cause an improvement in ARR growth? I assume that one has been perhaps Adobe Express as a more compelling entry point. Is there anything else that you could call out as some things that you believe that Adobe's focused on that really some issues in the past that you think are going to be resolved and therefore before Figma that could improve despite the macro or help growth in the creative side? Many thanks.\n\nDavid Wadhwani\n\nPresident of Digital Media, Adobe\n\nYeah, I'm happy to jump in. Shantanu, you can add anything. At a high level, if you look at what we've talked about at Analyst Day, our strategy is very clear, which is new users and retention are the core drivers and focus areas. As Shantanu mentioned, we were being very focused and very intentional in terms of those two things. When it comes to new subscribers, we added more new commercial subscribers this year than we've ever added in our history. That is a really important intentional set of activities we're doing.\nMany of those new users tend to be non-professionals, right, or they tend to be early in career professionals. They are coming in and leveraging our initial single app plan or Adobe Express as an example. We're very happy to have them take that on because we believe very strongly that the opportunities to drive and upsell them from Express to single app, and from single app to all apps, is going to be something that is persistent and something that is very ready and available to us at the times we need. The main thing, though, is about getting them into the products and making them successful. With that focus, we've also been maniacally operational about retention of those bases. I think people have asked questions as you broaden the net.\nYou bring in other users that are not typical Adobe users. What's happening to the retention rates? I think we also shared that we're seeing usage of products continues to stay very strong as we're bringing these new audiences, and we're seeing retention continue to take up and improve.\nIn fact, retention now is better than it was pre-pandemic, as an example. We continue to bring in new users, we continue to retain those new users, and we see organic opportunities to move them up and upgrade them. Shantanu mentioned a great example of education. We continue to see a lot of people come in with our education pricing, and then we have the opportunity, two years or three years later, when they graduate, to upgrade them to full commercial pricing. Those activities are playing out as expected, and we see a lot more opportunity to it. It all comes down to bringing new users in, getting them using the products a lot, and retaining them.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nMaybe to add to that, Keith, I mean, when you think about the newer businesses that we're talking about, video just continues to be a really key growth driver, 3D and immersive imaging and photography. If you take a step back, I think there are two things happening in the macroeconomic environment that are actually going to be tailwinds. The first is the fact that it is the golden age of design. Everybody would like to express themselves. There are more screens on which all of this content is being consumed. I think the insatiable consumer demand for content is certainly driving a lot more content that's being created.\nOne of the exciting areas that I think David and Anil have talked about is what we are calling content supply chain. When you take even the larger companies, they are all trying to get a handle of, as they engage digitally with customers, how much content is being created? Where is it being created? Where is it being delivered? How do I localize it? What's the efficacy of that content?\nI think this content supply chain and everything we have with our creative applications, our asset management, the fact that we then deliver that content, I think we continue to believe that that's going to be a growth driver for the entire business as well. I won't underestimate the insatiable consumer demand, but I also won't underestimate what's happening as enterprises recognize that the way to engage with people is to personalize that content.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nHey, operator, we're at the top of the hour. We'll make time for one more question, and then we'll wrap up. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYou bet. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize for any background noise. I guess we've heard a lot about the continuing growth initiatives, the demand environment sounding like it's pretty resistant to any macro pressures that we're seeing at the moment. I'll ask the kind of other side of the equation. As you think about the levers that you have on the margin side, the discipline that you've been exhibiting, it does seem like over the last quarter and maybe the past few quarters, that margin story, that margin discipline has continued to exceed at least our expectations.\nAs we look at the next year, as you think about the levers that you have in the business, if the parts of the business should slow, can you go through, maybe walk through a little bit of where you see the opportunity to either, A, lean in, or, B, pull back? Also, how we should think about cash conversion in that scenario from a cash flow perspective. Thanks again.\n\nDan Durn\n\nEVP and CFO, Adobe\n\nYeah. From an operating performance standpoint, you rightfully point out the company is performing really, really well. We're doing what we've always done inside the company, which is drive growth, deliver industry-leading products, and innovation to our customers, help them become more effective. We're on the critical path of driving revenue for their business. We do it in a very disciplined way that drives margin and cash flow while driving growth. We talked a lot about rule of 40 at our FA day.\nIf I were to take a step back and reflect on FY 2022, it's a complicated macro environment. We were operating at a rule of 60 for the year. We feel really good about our ability to operate. As I look forward into next year, we're going to continue to lead, and we're going to continue to innovate. We're going to continue to make our customers successful. We'll continue to do what we've always done, which is ruthlessly prioritize where we make our investments, constantly review the portfolio, prioritize the things that are going to drive long-term value for our customers, and do it in a very disciplined way.\nThat's the operating tone inside the company. Nothing's changed on that front. We feel really good about how we're executing in the environment, and the momentum we're carrying into 2023. From a cash flow standpoint, it all starts with driving that discipline in the business. We'll continue to drive cash flow and deploy that excess cash on a quarterly basis to create value with the shareholders.\n\nShantanu Narayen\n\nChairman and CEO, Adobe\n\nAlex, given that was the last question, let me start off by saying as we celebrate our 40th anniversary, it's both humbling and inspiring to think about the impact that Adobe has had on the communication world and what we've been able to do. It's rare to be able to say at this level that we believe that our best years are ahead of us. If I take a step back and I look at what we had done in 2022, there are three things that stand out for me: the Digital Media ARR, and just continuing to drive new customer acquisition and deliver innovative products across both the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. We've done a really good job of demonstrating why creativity and design is going to be more important, and also combining creativity with productivity.\nOn the DX side, the organic creation of the Adobe Experience Platform and its apps and the success that we've seen associated with that, the fact that we just had our first billion-dollar quarter as it related to subscription revenues, I think that just reflects both the fact that we created this category. Unlike all of the other enterprise software companies who are in that space, we're just ruthlessly focused on this, and it is unique in that it helps both the top line and bottom line for enterprises. To the question that you specifically asked, Alex, I mean, profitability, despite the FX impact that impacted hundreds of millions of dollars, when you look back and say at the end of the year, we exceeded our non-GAAP EPS that we had said a year ago, I think that is a really amazing performance by the finance and operations team of making sure that we continue to remain focused. I think as it relates to go forward, we've clearly talked about why we're excited about the innovative roadmap, why we're excited about all of the things that are going to come up in 2023 and beyond. I think it was a good year.\nWe will continue to remain focused. I want to thank our employees who really are the unsung heroes of all of this execution and the work that they do.For every one of you, thank you again for your interest in Adobe. Happy holidays, and wishing you all a joyous holiday season.\n\nJonathan Vaas\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Adobe\n\nThanks, everyone. This concludes the call.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

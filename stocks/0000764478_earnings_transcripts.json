Overall. So there are places for us to kind of offset some of those pressures that do come every year like we've been doing and so we feel like over the long term that would be our intent is to try to drive more profitability in our businesses as we as we grow the sales.\n\nOkay. Thank you for that that's helpful. And then obviously great to see comps positive, but I want to ask about the categories that are not performing as well what needs to happen for the CE category in the appliance category to get back to growth.\n\nThanks for the thanks for the question the appliance category is probably the most difficult one that we have in the market today. The vast majority of the appliance market is customers, meaning that they're replacing a product that has broken some way. We're also seeing a very high amount of single unit purchases, meaning.\n\nWasher breaks theyre, not replacing the washer and dryer pair there just replacing the washer, which is just very different than what generally happens in the market and that is a very high percentage in total which means that promos are not as effective as they are in total because youre dealing with a fixed customer base. We also don't have a pro business and really our sweet spot is.\n\npremium and packages.\n\nAnd in the.\n\nHistoric years.\n\nReally what we have to do is shift our model a little bit. So we're looking at increasing our labor coverage in the department also looking at focusing on delivery and speed of delivery in particular, which is critical in a dress market and then also looking at even having opportunities in some of our stores for a customer to be able to take the product with them that day, which is also something that is emphasize.\n\nMore in the market that we're in so looking to adjust our model until it flips back a little bit more towards our sweet spot, which is again that premium and packages, but we really need to meet the customer where they're at in a very duress market and hopefully as housing and different things changed in the market starts to swing back to something that might be a little bit more normal.\n\nOn the TV side I would just make a couple of comments there.\n\nOur revenue performance did improve sequentially, even though it's still down year over year. What's interesting is that our unit performance really accelerated and moved to slight growth in the quarter.\n\nAnd so you can see some of the industry wide ASP compression there between talked about.\n\nI I R share trends have improved materially on the unit side and we believe that were up slightly year over year on television and a lot of that because we have invested in some of the things that we've been talking about this sharp pricing the increased marketing and expanded specialty labor and those expanded merchandising experience within the stores.\n\nTcl and and LG, and then augmenting that with the expanded services offerings and working on how that experience works digitally all of that I think the team is doing a great job, putting together a more fulsome assortment and more even more price point options for our customers, which is at least moving that business in the right trajectory.\n\n.\n\nGreat. Thank you for that happy holidays.\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nThe next question comes from Christopher with Jpmorgan. Your line is open.\n\nThanks. Good morning. So my first question I'm going to try to go out.\n\nThe marketplace any adds margin accretion a little bit differently I know others have asked so.\n\nCan you talk about.\n\nWhat youre seeing in terms of like the benefit of both businesses. So the gross margin line in the second half and then as you think about in 2026, one would expect.\n\nThe revenue growth there to accelerate is it your expectation that as the business scales. The margin rates of those businesses also accelerated I think.\n\nOn our side, we think about that as strong double digit.\n\nMargin rates for both businesses.\n\nYes, I'll break down a little bit for both the different parts of the P&L here first if I think about gross profit rate for both ads and marketplace. They're both helped the gross profit rate in the back half of this year.\n\nSo obviously in the marketplace side, we're scaling that business. If you think about the rate is helpful. There.\n\nAs we get into next year, we would continue to expect the marketplace to scale, but we're clearly going to lap the launch and midway through next year, which have might have an impact but generally speaking.\n\nMore you grow it more the more net commissions should be helpful to the gross margin right now exactly linear every quarter, depending on the scaling and when we lap.\n\nOn the AD side from a gross profit rate perspective, again, we're continuing to explore and expand into new parts of the ads business.\n\nMeant that we are successful in driving incremental revenue and profitability from that which we do.\n\nWe're planning to do that would also be helpful to the gross profit rate into the future now exactly how much.\n\nHow it laps every quarter it might not be might not be exactly the same but those would be the intent.\n\nOn the Oi rate side, I think it's going to come down to is we talked a little bit earlier like how much do we feel like we need to invest and what's the opportunity for that investment and return looks like and so as we get into next year. That's something we're still evaluating in terms of the technology the people and other things that we might need to drive those two initiatives. We think those are the .\n\nDecisions overall over time for us to drive more rate opportunities from those two initiatives.\n\nHow much flows through to Oi were not quite right.\n\nOkay.\n\nAt least.\n\nSure.\n\nIt is expected to more than offset the work that we're working in.\n\nActually no.\n\nI feel compelled or.\n\nFederal.\n\nHome care is really to stay more relevant with the customer.\n\nI mentioned the work is missing.\n\nOur goal is to drive more.\n\nWe continue without interruption.\n\nYes, I think in consideration and make sure that we are elaborating.\n\nThat completes and approximately one.\n\nAs a result of reduced spending in Q1 on certain programs.\n\nPartnerships you mentioned a few on the call.\n\nOr does it.\n\nTo stay relevant with the consumer right.\n\nYes.\n\nNet of revenues is expected to come from new business.\n\nSo that part we're starting.\n\nWe believe dollars of submitted bids awaiting award decision.\n\nYes.\n\nThat becomes really the IV.\n\nPut it in a position starting with video.\n\nIsn't this about as much what we're focused on building and expanding next year.\n\nWe expect.\n\nEBITDA on the range of one one to $1 1 billion.\n\nGot it.\n\nWe were running at about 5% growth for the first three weeks in November.\n\nI'm not sure how much the government that we haven't done the math on specifically the government shutdown, probably doesn't help certain jive, which obviously are more impacted than others, but we are comping, a pretty larger amount of growth through the first three weeks.\n\nOf November so the shape of the quarter is likely going to be a little bit different this year compared to last year.\n\nNovember was up 4% last year December was down 2%. So as we get into December the compares get a little easier and we are seeing people gravitate towards those big events that obviously this week and as the weeks before Christmas or the biggest events in the holiday. So we do feel like Theres an opportunity there for us. So we still feel like there's an opportunity for us to grow .\n\nSales the shape will look a little different even though the timing is pretty similar to how we saw it last year.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next question comes from Anthony to Canberra with capital markets. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for squeezing me in I know this is always kind of tough.\n\nGiven all the different product categories that you're in but how do you feel just at a high level in terms of market share I mean, particularly given the fact that yourselves with accelerated and you should have the best comps in several years. So so how do you think about that at a high level.\n\nI appreciate where you started Anthony with it is really difficult in this industry. There just isn't a single source of sharing information and there are multiple staffing.\n\nThat being said when we tried to pull and triangulate all the data sources. We believe we have improved our share position over the last two quarters and in Q3, we estimate our share was flattish to slightly up.\n\nWe've always said shares a long game conversation for us and all the initiatives that we're talking about are driving toward more of a sustained ability to at the highest level of drive shares and in that youre going to constantly be making trade off promotion decisions tradeoff pricing decisions. We feel like we're strong right now, particularly in computing and gaming I talked.\n\nOur TV unit share position, which now we feel like is airing on the positive side and Theres a lot of these kind of newer categories or the expanded assortment that would be a marketplace that is bolstering our point of view about how we feel like we're sitting for sure. So again always a conversation longer game, but feel like the trajectory is headed the direction that we want.\n\nGot it that's helpful context, and then just real quickly on the switch to .\n\nBecause we are selling quite well and the tonnages.\n\nSure.\n\nEstimate for their fiscal year, how you felt about your switch to allocations relative to your initial expectations. I know you historically have over indexed on Nintendo products, particularly relative to.\n\nPlaystation and Xbox would.\n\nLook to your thoughts just in terms of how you feel you guys are doing from an allocation perspective. Thank you.\n\nYes. Thank you for the question, we've actually been very happy with Us, which two obviously the launch was outstanding and it drove growth last quarter and we do expect gaming to continue to grow as we lead into Q4, it's been highly publicized that the amount of switch two units in the market is a lot higher than what switch one was in the same timeframe. So we.\n\nActually been happy with the ability to come closer to meeting customer demand. We do think demand over holiday. We will continue to still be very strong and then in gaming in general it's not just switch there are other aspects of that business that are driving growth.\n\nIn a handheld in general whether it be the new product from us use that as a partnership with them on Xbox or other products from companies like Lenovo with their Legion go just handheld gaming is a driver across the entire gaming segment. We're really excited that we think we have the best assortment, there and can really meet customers' needs across anything they want to do whether it.\n\nSwitch all the way up to any any aspect of handheld game in in total and that's really making up for some of the the slowing sales as you see in just the traditional PFS five and Xbox as those get to the end of their lifecycle and one of the things that I think it's interesting about all of the devices that Jason just talked about these are pretty high price point devices and especially consider.\n\nDuring their gaming they tend toward kind of a younger cohort. So we really like our position here and we're kind of doubling down both physically and digitally to make sure. We offer the best possible experience I gave our team.\n\nJust because we can deliver these amazing experiences, especially at retail.\n\nSo with that I think that's our last question.\n\nThanks, Anthony appreciate it.\n\nSo I think that's our last question. Thank you all so much for joining US. We hope you all have a lovely holiday season, and we look forward to speaking with you all at the end of our year.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining you may now disconnect.\n\n[music].\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[noise].",

Welcome to Best Buy's Second Quarter Fiscal '26 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Chief Financial and Strategy Officer; and Jason Bonfig, our Chief Customer Product and Fulfillment Officer.\nDuring the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to, I think it's important to start by acknowledging the horrific shooting that occurred at the enunciation Church Canela Mentry School in Minneapolis yesterday morning. Just a short distance from our corporate headquarters, our hearts break for the young life lost and their families who are grieving and our thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones and our community, as we process this unimaginable tragedy.\nAnd with a deep breath, we will now turn to earnings. Today, we are very pleased to report better-than-expected results for the second quarter. On revenue of $9.4 billion, we delivered an adjusted operating income rate of 3.9% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.28. We delivered comparable sales growth of 1.6%, our highest in 3 years. This was driven by a mix of new technology innovation, our relentless focus on a seamless omnichannel customer experience and our strong vendor partnerships.\nWe grew sales in several product categories, including gaming, computing, mobile phones, wearables and headphones. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home theater, appliance, tablet and drone categories. We reported higher-than-expected growth in gaming, largely due to our successful Switch 2 release. We saw strong results, not only in console sales, but also the related peripherals and software. We provided our customers with a smooth experience from the preorder process all the way to getting the console in their hands at midnight on launch day and subsequent post-launch inventory drops. There was a lot of customer and employee enthusiasm for our June 5 midnight opening and every store had lines of excited customers waiting to get in.\nI will add that in addition to switch to growth, we also saw growth in other types of handheld gaming as well as augmented reality glasses. In computing, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth and the highest number of second quarter laptop unit sales in 15 years. This is due to continued momentum driven by customers' need to replace and upgrade products combined with our unique blend of broad assortment and expert advice, service and support.\nGrowth came from across the assortment and across price. As expected, tablet sales declined as we lapped the strong sales of the new generation iPad that launched in Q2 of last year. Our online sales were 33% of domestic sales in Q2. They grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter due to higher traffic and increased customer adoption of our highly rated app. Customers chose to visit one of our stores to pick up 45% of online purchases and our store pickup, including curbside, customer satisfaction metrics continue to improve even as volumes have increased.\nFor the most part, customer shopping behavior in the first half of the year has not changed materially from the commentary we have shared for the past several quarters. Customers continue to be resilient, but deal focused and attracted to more predictable sales momentum, including our Black Friday and July sales event. In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to or when there is technology innovation.\nWe delivered yet another year-over-year increase in our relationship Net Promoter Score, which tracks consumers' likelihood to recommend Best Buy. As well as higher marks from consumers for meeting tech needs like no one else, offering good deals and being a company they can trust. We also saw year-over-year improvements in associate availability and product availability. I am proud to see the lowest employee turnover rates in 10 years, in addition to the higher engagement scores in our last employee survey. I am inspired by the way our teams have been successfully navigating tariffs, even as the backdrop continues to change. The impact during the quarter was basically in line with our expectations and was not material to our Q2 financial results.\nOur approach is to deliver the right product assortments to match customer needs and budgets while partnering with our vendors. We delivered better-than-expected results in the second quarter, and we feel increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year. Given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter. At this point, we do believe we are trending toward the higher end of our sales range.\nI am pleased with the progress we are making on our fiscal '26 strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position in retail as a leading omnichannel destination for technology, while at the same time, building and scaling new profit streams that we believe will drive returns in the future.\nOur first fiscal '26 strategic priority is to drive omnichannel experiences that resonate with our customers. We often do this in partnership with our vendors, and we have a busy and exciting second half in front of us. This fall, we are amplifying our partnership with Meta, bringing AI glasses and expanded experiences to all stores. In more than 50 locations, immersive showcase areas and expert support will allow customers to discover and demo the technology.\nRay-Ban and now Oakley Meta AI glasses are available. We expect them to be fun and highly giftable products for holiday. In small appliances, we are launching new experiences with brands like Revel and SharkNinja. These will feature expanded assortments to inspire [indiscernible] baristas and chefs and innovative health and beauty solutions. We are also introducing expert sales associates in select locations to bring this innovation to life for our customers.\nIn home theater, we are expanding the merchandising areas, featuring TVs from TCL, Hisense and LG. The technologies and focus for TCL and Hisense will be mini LED screens. And for LG, it will be the latest and most striking OLED screens. Each area will be staffed by a dedicated expert to address any questions and help customers get what they need. In the mobile phone department, we are bringing our new operating model with Verizon and AT&T to more stores. This model gives customers the opportunity to work with expert salespeople like Verizon, AT&T or specially trained Best Buy employees who can tap directly into the carrier system. This is resulting in better customer experience and higher sales growth.\nWe will have this in the majority of stores in the back half of the year, which we believe puts us in an even stronger position for the new innovation and phone launches. In gaming, we worked with Nintendo to double the switch merchandising space in all stores ahead of the June launch. Nintendo not only invested in store merchandising, they also partnered exclusively with us to have game trucks at select stores. These game trucks are physical trailers that allow fans to play the new system and the latest game.\nIn computing, we provide customers with the help and inspiration they need as they upgrade or replace their products. We continue to collaborate with our vendors as Newtek and more AI capabilities are released. In fact, we offer 125 models of laptops and desktops featuring enhanced AI capabilities like CoPilot Plus with almost 70% of them retail exclusive to Best Buy. They are supported by 16,000 specially trained experts to help customers explore features and applications in daily life. We are also focused on helping customers get what they need to transition to Windows 11 as Microsoft will end support for the Windows 10 operating system this October. After October, customers who have not transitioned will no longer receive new features, technical support or security updates. We believe this is a more significant opportunity than prior end-of-support examples because there is a large installed base of customers who need new devices with more processing power to use Windows 11.\nIn collaboration with Microsoft, we are leveraging personalized marketing, promotions and store associate training to drive product refreshes and support. Our Geek Squad can help customers who need a computer repair to convert instead to an upgraded device. Additionally, Geek Squad can help customers set up and transfer their data to new devices, whether in stores, in homes or remotely.\nCustomers can also trade in their old devices for value, they can use to purchase new Windows 11 devices. All the examples of collaboration and vendor investment I just outlined are in addition to the long-standing partnerships and in-store investments from other large vendors like Apple, LG and Samsung. Many vendors invest not only in training our associates but also in labor hours to augment our staff. In fact, we expect vendor labor investment to be approximately 20% higher than last year in the second half of this year. This is an important aspect of the Best Buy story. We have relevant traffic, a unique expert sales and service model and physical space that is extremely valuable to our vendors. And we have seen the demand for store presence grow from both our existing vendor base as well as new partners who recognize the value of live interactions for complex conversations.\nIn fact, we just announced a new partnership with IKEA U.S. We are collaborating with them to pilot 1,000 square foot areas that showcase kitchen and laundry room settings from IKEA and appliances from Best Buy, staffed by IKEA coworkers, this experience will launch in 10 stores throughout Florida and Texas, with 2 of the locations also serving as pickup points for most products that can be purchased on ikea.com.p\nThis is the first time IKEA products and services will be available through another U.S. retailer, creating innovative ways for both of us to meet customer needs in a rapidly changing environment. Our second strategic priority for fiscal '26 is focused on incremental profitability streams. I'm excited to say that we launched our Best Buy marketplace last week. We now have 6x more products available online for customers than we did before. We have more tech options than ever, both from big names like Samsung, Dell, HP and Intel and new vendors that help us level up our assortment across categories. For example, customers can personalize their gaming setup with products like custom controllers and more options around shares, keyboards, monitors and headsets.\nWe tripled our mobile phone accessories assortment with more options for cases, screen protectors, chargers and more. We also have hundreds of new brands from fanatic sports merchandise to Caroti cookware, in new categories like licensed sporting goods, seasonal decor and much more. With this growing product availability, our upgraded search technology will be important. This new AI search, which we are testing now and expect to roll out by holiday, uses helpful comps and to see more like this option that guides customers to be more specific, improving their chances of finding what they need.\nFor our sellers, our marketplace provides an additional avenue to increase their reach and build their brands leveraging our qualified traffic. Our stores also play a key role in our marketplace. Customers can return most products purchased through a marketplace seller at their local Best Buy store, plus our Blue Shirt sales associates use an app that makes it easy for them to help customers find products across our wide assortment, in-store and online, including third-party sellers. It also allows them to seamlessly send product links directly into a customer's online cart.\nWe continue to expect Marketplace to have a positive impact on our operating income rate in fiscal '26 even after start-up costs, investments and estimated cannibalization of our first-party product revenue. Over time, we expect it to help drive profit dollars and unit share. In addition, it will provide opportunities for Best Buy ads through new advertisers and increased traffic. Our Best Buy ads team had a productive quarter, orchestrating our largest ad campaign ever in combination with our marketing team. It was centered around the theme, AI that designed to drive more awareness of the benefits of AI in your everyday life. It included several advertisers and spanned the full advertising funnel, including video, social, display, owned assets and in-store presence.\nIt was successful across a number of fronts, impressions, clicks, product interactions and units sold all exceeded our expectations. We are planning Phase 2 of the campaign to run as we move into the holiday season. The Best Buy ads team will host our first-ever client showcase on September 16. The spotlighting our scale, performance and innovation to key decision-makers across agencies, brands, partners and press. We continue to see fiscal '26 as a pivotal year for Best Buy ads as we expand into new opportunity areas including agencies, demand-side platforms or DSPs, and non-endemic advertising relationships. We are excited to take our already robust retail media network to a new level in the coming years.\nWe expect growth in ad collections to benefit our gross profit rate in fiscal '26. From an operating income rate perspective, we expect a neutral impact due to the investments we are making in technology and talent. This brings us to our third strategic priority for fiscal '26. It is imperative that we continue our long-standing diligence around driving efficiencies and identifying cost reductions to help fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives and offset pressures in our business. There are many ways we realize these. They are often achieved with the help of technology and analytics through ongoing vendor partnerships and vendor selections throughout the enterprise and by modifying existing processes or customer offerings. Other times, they are the result of us moving on from initiatives that aren't generating the financial return in the time line we had originally envisioned such as the exit of our Care at Home Best Buy Health initiative.\nToday, I want to highlight the ongoing modernization of our supply chain, which is driving efficiencies and elevating our customer experience. We are implementing a new data-driven sourcing solution to choose the most efficient location to fulfill online orders, 40% of all shift to home units were processed through this new model during the second quarter. delivering cost savings while also improving our on-time delivery performance. We are targeting at least 70% of all orders to go through this new model prior to holiday with 100% implementation in early 2026.\nIn addition, we have evolved our carrier strategy and FedEx is now our primary national parcel carrier. We are partnering with them to make our supply chain smarter and expect increased integration between us to both improve customer experience and lower costs. For example, just last week, we added FedEx real-time tracking data into customer order communications across all our FedEx orders. This will provide customers with more timely and accurate updates and should reduce support calls, cancellations and reship costs. With FedEx, we can also expand our national shipping operations, especially for Sunday deliveries. So we can deliver products to our customers even faster than we do today. As you would expect, we are continuing to automate our distribution centers. We are currently outfitting our distribution centers with automated guided vehicles that autonomously move talents around the warehouse, both horizontally and vertically, optimizing warehouse flow and storage. In summary, we are pleased with our Q2 execution and financial results.\nOur sales momentum has continued into August, and our quarter-to-date comparable sales are running in the low single-digit range. We are seeing a strong customer response to our back-to-school sales events. These results demonstrate an important aspect of our thesis. Our model really shines when there is innovation. This is because we are a trusted source for the latest and greatest new tech. We have a broad range of assortments in addition to unique in-store and digital experiences. We also have Geek Squad services of our customers, and we are a true partner to our vendors, often working with them from early in the product development cycle, all the way to launching products on our sales floor. In the back half of the year, we expect to drive continued growth in computing, gaming, phones and augmented reality. We also intend to improve the performance of our home theater and major appliance categories in the back half of the year.\nWe plan to do this through a blend of sharp pricing, assortment adjustments, increased marketing, expanded specialty labor and faster large product fulfillment options. We are also excited about the launch of our marketplace and the opportunity to offer customers even more tech options. We wholeheartedly believe Best Buy is uniquely positioned to unlock what technology can do for every person in every moment. I want to sincerely thank all of our team for their enthusiasm for technology, their customer service passion and their determined execution during the quarter.\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q2 performance and fiscal '26 outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Let me start with an overview of how our second quarter performed versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.6% exceeded our outlook of being slightly down to last year. Our adjusted operating income rate of 3.9% was 30 basis points better than expected, which was largely driven by SG&A leverage from the stronger sales.\nOur gross profit rate declined 30 basis points to last year versus an outlook of being approximately flat. This was primarily driven by a higher mix of sales coming from lower-margin categories such as gaming and computing. I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue of $9.4 billion increased 1.6% versus last year.\nOur adjusted operating income rate decreased 20 basis points compared to last year. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.28. By month, our Enterprise comparable sales were down approximately 1% in May before increasing to almost 3% in both June and July. These results included lapping last year's strong tablet performance in May as well as the successful launch of the Switch 2 in June.\nIn our Domestic segment, revenue increased 0.9% to $8.7 billion, driven by comparable sales growth of 1.1%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributor to comparable sales growth were gaming, computing and mobile phones, which were partially offset by declines in home theater, appliances, tablets and drones. International revenue of $740 million increased 11.3% versus last year, which was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 7.6% and revenue from Best Buy Express locations that opened in Canada after the second quarter of fiscal '25.\nFrom a category standpoint, consistent with our domestic segment, the largest drivers of comparable sales growth were gaming, computing and mobile phones. Our domestic gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 23.4%. This was primarily due to lower product margin rates partially offset by rate improvement within the services category. The lower product margin rates were primarily driven by the higher sales mix of lower-margin categories.\nOur international gross profit rate decreased 210 basis points to 21.8%. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates which were also largely driven by higher mix of lower-margin product categories.\nMoving to SG&A, where our domestic adjusted SG&A increased $19 million, primarily due to 1 compensation expense, which included higher medical claims; two, lapping last year's favorable legal settlement of approximately $10 million; and three, technology investments. The previous items were partially offset by reduced Best Buy Health expenses. As we continue to narrow our focus on our strategy, we incurred $114 million of restructuring charges in Q2 FY '26, associated with the enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in the quarter.\nYear-to-date, we have returned a total of $568 million to shareholders through dividends of $403 million and share repurchases of $165 million. For the year, we still expect to spend approximately $300 million on repurchases.\nMoving on to our full year fiscal '26 financial guidance. We are encouraged by our better-than-expected second quarter results and the momentum to start the third quarter. As Corie shared earlier, we are maintaining the annual guidance we provided last quarter. At this point, we do believe we are trending towards the higher end of our sales range. As expected, the tariff situation has continued to evolve since our last call.\nThe tariff rates have increased since May. However, we believe the estimated impacts of the higher rates still fall within our previous guidance range. Consistent with our comments last quarter, due to mitigation efforts by both vendors and by Best Buy, the increased product costs that are flowing to us are expected to remain lower than the tariff rates. Our reiterated enterprise guidance for fiscal '26 is the following: revenue in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%, adjusted operating income rate of approximately 4.2% and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.30 and capital expenditures of approximately $700 million.\nNext, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance. We still expect our annual gross profit rate to be slightly unfavorable compared to last year. In the second half of the year, we expect gross profit rate pressure will be similar, if not a little higher than it was in the first half of the year. When compared to last year, the more notable gross profit rate drivers for the second half of the year include: first, our product margin rates are expected to be unfavorable, largely due to a higher mix of lower-margin products and our plans to remain competitively priced. Lower product margin rates are expected to be partially offset by: one, the rollout of our U.S. marketplace; two, improved profitability from our services category; and three, growth from Best Buy ads. Now moving to our adjusted SG&A expectations. As a percentage of revenue, we expect our adjusted SG&A to be slightly lower than fiscal '25. The most notable puts and takes for the second quarter of the year include the following: we continue to expect benefits from ongoing efficiencies and effectiveness work streams, including Best Buy Health. Partially offsetting these items are SG&A increases in support of our Best Buy ads and marketplace initiatives, which include advertising, technology and employee compensation expense. The high end of our guidance reflects incentive compensation that is approximately flat to last year.\nFrom a phasing standpoint, we expect Q3 to be higher than last year in Q4 to be lower. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses, including incentive compensation to align with sales trends. Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the third quarter. We expect our third quarter comparable sales growth to be similar to our second quarter performance. In addition, we are planning for an adjusted operating income rate that is approximately flat to last year's rate of 3.7%.\nI will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.",

And now I will turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It has certainly been an eventful start to the year. I'm proud of how our teams have been navigating the environment and planning our business against the backdrop of dynamic macroeconomic factors. They've employed a calm strategic and steadfast approach with their ultimate focus on our customers, and the partnerships we have with our vendors. Against this backdrop, we executed well in Q1 and delivered better-than-expected profitability.\nToday, we are reporting first quarter revenue that was slightly below last year as expected, and adjusted operating income rate that was flat year-over-year. On revenue of $8.8 billion, we delivered an adjusted operating income rate of 3.8% and an adjusted earnings per share of $1.15. From a product category perspective, we drove comparable sales growth in computing, mobile phones and tablets. This growth was offset by declines in home theater, appliances and drones. Resulting in a domestic comparable sales decline of 0.7%. We delivered 6% comparable sales growth in the combined computing and tablet categories. Our omnichannel operations provide strong support for our Q1 online sales, which grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. They were nearly 32% of total domestic sales, a slightly higher mix than last year. Almost 60% of online purchases are delivered or available for pickup within 1 day, and we drove our strongest on-time ship to home delivery performance in 3 years.\nFor the most part, customer behavior in Q1 did not change materially from the commentary we have shared for the past several quarters. Customers continue to be deal focused and attracted to more predictable sales moments. We believe the consumer has remained resilient, while dealing with persistent inflation, making them value focused and thoughtful about big ticket purchases. We also still see a customer that is willing to spend on high price point products when they need to or when there is technology innovation. Additionally, we continue to see material year-over-year improvement in our domestic relationship Net Promoter Score, which tracks consumers' likelihood to recommend Best Buy during the quarter. We believe this is the direct result of our relentless focus on elevating our unique customer experience.\nI'm excited to discuss the progress we have made in Q1 on our fiscal '26 strategic priorities. But first, we must address the current tariff environment impacting our industry, our business and consumers overall. Let me begin by saying there were some developments overnight that may have future impacts. We are obviously not addressing these in our following prepared remarks as there remains a great deal of uncertainty. As we stressed last quarter, international trade is critically important for our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical and complex. There have been a lot of developments since our March conference call.\nWhile China remains the #1 source for products we sell, we currently estimate the percentage of product COGS it represents is approximately 30% to 35%, compared to the 55% metric we shared in March. This is the result of vendors using production capabilities in multiple countries and leveraging their ability to flex sourcing options as the environment evolves. We estimate that the combination of the United States and Mexico are approximately 25% of product COGS at this point.\nThe level of tariff currently varies across our product categories. Let me provide a high-level breakdown. The consumer electronics products that are coming from Mexico, including televisions and major appliances, are compliant with the USMCA trade agreement and are not subject to tariffs. As it relates to China, there are currently two distinct tariff scenarios. First, categories that are subject to the Section 232 semiconductor investigation, including computers, mobile phones, networking and monitors are currently subject to the 20% fentanyl tariff. Roughly half our China COGS falls into this scenario. Second, categories like major and small appliances, gaming consoles, furniture and accessories are subject to the 20% fentanyl tariff plus the recently instituted 10% baseline tariff. Finally, consumer electronics products coming from countries such as Vietnam, India, South Korea and Taiwan are currently subject to 10% tariffs.\nWe have been actively employing many tactics in partnership with our vendors as we navigate the dynamic situation and work to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and business. I would organize them into five main themes. These include: One, leveraging manufacturing flexibility. Since 2018, many vendors, including our own exclusive brands have created new manufacturing locations that provide optionality. Two, negotiating costs, including consolidating volume into fewer partners for large negotiations. Three, increasing country diversification we influence many of our partners to start or continue building resiliency into their supply chains by ensuring there are at least two locations available to manufacture the same or similar products for distribution across the globe. Four, adjusting assortments. We review and modify assortments to ensure a wide range of customer needs and budgets are met and rationalize where appropriate to consolidate volume. And five, as a last reason, we adjust prices as tariff-related inventory cost changes are implemented.\nAs a reminder, Best Buy only directly imports approximately 2% to 3% of our overall assortment. I want to make the point that due to mitigation efforts by both vendors and by Best Buy, the increased product costs that are flowing to us are lower than the tariff rates. And as of mid-May, we have already made the related price and promotional adjustments to our assortment. I also want to stress that, as always, we are committed to offering competitive prices to our customers.\nFrom an inventory perspective, we have continued with our long-standing strategy of targeting roughly 60 days of forward supply. At this point in time, we feel good about inventory levels overall and for back-to-school. I am grateful to our deeply tenured and talented teams for their skill in operating through volatile conditions and for their deep partnerships with our vendors. As we look to the rest of the year, there is still uncertainty related to tariff levels, timing and countries involved in addition to the potential actions of others in the industry as well as the potential reaction of American consumers. However, based on the current tariff levels we just articulated, we are updating our annual outlook with our best view at this time. We are lowering our full year comparable sales range to down 1% to up 1% and and expect an adjusted operating income rate that is consistent with last year or approximately 4.2%. Our underlying working assumptions are that tariffs stay at the current levels for the rest of the year, and there is no material change in consumer behavior from the trends we have seen in very recent quarters.\nAs you can imagine and based on our history, we will continue to scenario plan and adjust with agility as the situation evolves. Matt will provide more detail. Now I would like to update you on the progress we are making on our strategic priorities.\nOur strategy is to continue to strengthen our position in retail as the leading omnichannel destination for technology while at the same time, building and scaling new profit streams that we believe will drive returns in the future.\nAs a reminder, our fiscal '26 strategic priorities are as follows: one, drive omnichannel experience improvements that resonate with our customers; two, launch and scale incremental profit streams, including Best Buy Marketplace and Best Buy Ads; and three, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency to fund strategic investments and offset pressures. Of course, these priorities are intertwined and worked together as a great customer experience drives the [indiscernible] of opportunity to generate incremental profit streams. I will start with our digital experiences, where nearly 1/3 of our domestic revenue is transacted and roughly 60% of our overall purchasers visit at some point during their shopping journey.\nWe are on track to launch our innovative improved search experience across dot-com, small view and our app later this year. We have already begun rolling the capability out to a small percentage of customers with plans for full rollout by holiday. We are excited about this experience as we believe it will, over time, be a tool used by customers and employees to solve real problems. This new experience will have AI-powered prompts to guide customers to more specific searches and natural conversational filtering for easier product discovery. It will also have fewer, higher-quality matches that reflect customer intent and richer product information to support confident buying decisions.\nDuring Q1, we introduced Best Buy storefront, which allow influencers and creators to build their own branded digital storefronts on bestbuy.com. It is early, but we have been pleased with the interest thus far, with more than 400 creators signed up and more than 60 store fronts already launched. Over time, we believe these will help drive increased traffic, engagement and sales. In our stores, we plan to touch every store this year with shopping experience updates.\nStarting in Q2, we are adding vendor pad in home theater, expanding tablet and virtual reality departments and enhancing experiences for the upcoming Switch 2 launch. As expected, there is strong customer demand for this launch, and preorder quantity is sold out very quickly. Best Buy is uniquely positioned for the Switch 2 launch, being one of the only retailers opening their doors at midnight on June 5 for either customers to pick up their consoles or grab another game. I would note that 70% of preorder customers selected in-store pickup underlining this important strength. The midnight opening is not only for preorder customers to pick up their products. There will also be additional consoles, games and accessories available for purchase.\nWe continue to focus on our unique in-store customer experience and in partnership with our vendors, we have made investments in our certification and training strategy for merchandising, customer engagement and selling. For example, in March, we brought our major appliances associates together in person for rigorous training to further upscale in the appliances category, which we expect to drive even higher productivity and better experiences for our customers. Earlier this month, we replicated this approach for computing and we'll do the same in July with the home theater category, ensuring that our teams are well prepared and knowledgeable across all major categories.\nOf course, we have a long history of augmenting our labor expertise with vendor-provided labor. For example, starting last year, both Verizon and AT&T have increased their investments in store labor and have partnered with us to improve technology systems integration in hundreds of stores. As a result, we are driving increased phone sales and activations and delivered our first mobile phones comp sales growth in 3 years. We also feel even better positioned for future product launches.\nOur second strategic priority for fiscal '26 is focused on incremental profitability strength. We believe our marketplace launch is even more important in this environment, as it provides ultimate flexibility in product assortments, price points, vendors and SKUs, so we can offer customers the broadest and most relevant experience possible, particularly when combined with our upgraded search capability. Also, sellers and advertisers will have an additional avenue to increase their reach and build their brands, leveraging our qualified traffic. We have seen strong interest from sellers and have already exceeded the seller count goal we set for the entire year. We expect to have at least 500 of them onboarded and ready for the initial midyear launch.\nAt launch, customers will be able to return their products directly to sellers or in our stores. And our customers will have the confidence of knowing all sellers will have a universal return window aligning with Best Buy policies. We continue to expect Marketplace to have a positive impact on our operating income rate for fiscal '26 even after start-up costs, investments and estimated cannibalization of our first-party product revenue. Over time, we expect Marketplace to help drive profit dollars and unit share. In addition, it will provide opportunities for our Best Buy ads business through new advertisers and increased traffic.\nWe continue to see fiscal '26 as a pivotal year for our Best Buy ads business. We have had a robust retail media network business for a long time in partnership with our vendors. We are proud of the business that we have built, and we see opportunities for growth. In Q1, we made material progress on our plan. We expanded the available inventory on our site by adding new ad slot placements on high-volume pages to better meet the level of demand and added 20 new vendor advertisers. We went live with one of the largest demand site platform, the Trade Desk. This expands our share of the broader digital dollars to flow to Best Buy apps. We were encouraged by the number of non-endemic advertisers who are already advertising with us as a result. We launched the capability called Social Plus in collaboration with Meta. Social Plus will allow advertisers to reach our customers more effectively on Facebook and Instagram. We are also expanding our engagement with new types of advertisers like quick-serve restaurants. We are excited about the results we were able to drive for a major quick-serve restaurant who ran an April campaign leveraging our first-party gaming segment. Lastly, we filled key leadership roles and opened our New York office.\nWe continue to expect growth in ad collections to benefit our gross profit rate in fiscal '26. From an operating income rate perspective, we expect more of a neutral impact due to the investments we are making. We believe the actions we are taking in fiscal '26 position us for future growth and rate expansion over the next number of years. This brings us to our third strategic priority for fiscal '26. It is imperative that we continue to focus on executing well what is within our control, which includes identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies to help offset pressures in our business and fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives. There are many ways we realize these efficiencies. They are often achieved with the help of technology and analytics. Through ongoing vendor partnerships and vendor selections throughout the enterprise and by modifying existing processes or customer offerings. Other times, the result of us moving on from initiatives that aren't generating the financial return we had additionally and originally envisioned.\nThere are a few areas I would like to highlight. Within our procurement operations, we expect to complete the multiyear deployment of our full source-to-pay technology capability in the second quarter. As we shared last quarter, this will give us expanded transparency into billions of dollars of goods not for resale event. In combination with the enhanced automation of our purchasing process, this paves the way for continuous cost optimization opportunities. Within our supply chain operations, we recently replaced our prior rule-based shipping process with a data-driven sourcing solution that uses real-time cost data to choose the most efficient fulfillment locations. This helps us deliver orders on time and reduce shipping costs.\nWithin our customer care operations, our use of new conversational AI technology, our upgraded IVR systems and other operational efficiencies have led to both better customer experience and cost savings. In Q1, we saw record low levels of cost per customer contact and customer call transfer rates as well as record high levels of customer satisfaction. These results are driving reductions in annual call volume expense.\nIn summary, we continue to demonstrate our strong execution through adaptability, strategic investments and operational strengths during turbulent times. We expect to navigate the tariff environment and emerge not only as a vital company, but a vibrant one as the landscape stabilizes over time. We are the trusted source for the latest and greatest new tech as well as a broad range of assortment unique in-store and digital experiences and the expert Geek Squad services to help our customers. We are also a true partner to our vendors, often working with them from early in the product development cycle, all the way to launching products on our sales floor. There are many reasons we are excited for the rest of the year.\nFrom a product category perspective, we expect growth in computing, including tablets to continue to be driven by the customers need to replace and upgrade products. We believe this will be helped by both the end of Windows 10 product support in October and ongoing innovation in the form of gradual improvement in AI use cases and the release of new AI features. In mobile phones, we expect benefits from our in-store experience improvements with the carriers to deliver growth for the year. In gaming, we expect the new launch and updated store experience to drive sales momentum for the year. We are also excited to expand our in-store experience and presence for Ray-Ban Meta glasses. This technology and other wearable AI products yet to be launched, will transform the way people live. And Best is the ultimate customer education destination.\nIn addition, the launch of our marketplace and relentless focus on our online and in-store customer experience will continue to underscore our unique position in the industry. Also, our refreshed brand is resonating more deeply with our customers, and we are driving continuous customer experience improvements across the business.\nAdded to that, our digital growth benefited from increased app adoption, checkout conversion and recognizable customers, allowing us to better personalize their experiences in the future.\nAnd finally, we continue to invest in our team who are ready to truly help our customers enrich their lives through technology, through more specialized knowledge, unique in-home expertise and robust support. Our recent engagement scores are the highest we have ever seen and our turnover remains the lowest we have seen in more than 5 years. I am so deeply appreciative that they choose to work for Best Buy, how they live our values, and for the culture they have created by bringing their unique experiences themselves to work every day. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Let me start with an overview of how the first quarter performed versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise comparable sales declined 0.7%, which was consistent with our outlook. Our adjusted operating income rate of 3.8% was approximately 40 basis points better than expected, which was primarily driven by favorable SG&A expense. The favorable SG&A was primarily the result of an indirect tax settlement and strong expense management. Our gross profit rate of 23.4% improved approximately 10 basis points versus last year which was consistent with our outlook.\nI will now talk about the first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 0.9% versus last year. Our adjusted operating income rate was flat to last year, with both gross profit and SG&A largely similar to last year as a percentage of revenue. While adjusted operating income dollars were flat to last year, our adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.15. One of the drivers of this lower EPS was approximately $10 million of lower investment income which was due to a lower average cash balance combined with lower short-term interest rates. By month, our enterprise comparable sales were down approximately 2.5% in February before increasing 0.5% in March and declining 0.4% in April. The shift of Easter improved March and negatively impacted April comparable sales by an estimated 250 to 300 basis points.\nIn our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 0.9% to $8.1 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 0.7% and International revenue of $640 million decreased 0.6% versus last year, which was driven by a comparable sales decline of 0.7%. The revenue decrease also included a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 450 basis points, which was offset by revenue from Best Buy Express locations that opened in Canada after Q1 fiscal '25. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23.5%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement within the services category, which includes our membership offerings. This improvement was partially offset by rate pressure within our Best Buy Health business and lower credit card profit sharing revenue. Our international gross profit rate decreased 80 basis points to 22%. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates and unfavorable supply chain costs.\nMoving to SG&A, where our domestic adjusted SG&A decreased $13 million which was primarily due to a favorable indirect tax settlement. In addition, we incurred $109 million in restructuring charges this quarter. Those charges are primarily associated with a restructuring initiative within our Best Buy Health business. During the quarter, we returned a total of $302 million to shareholders through dividends of $202 million and share repurchases of $100 million. We have raised our quarterly dividend for 12 straight years and remain committed to being a premium dividend payer.\nMoving on to our full year fiscal '26 financial guidance. In March, we made it clear that the guidance we provided excluded any estimated impacts from recently announced tariffs. At the same time, we provided a ballpark estimate of approximately 1 point of comparable sales pressure to our guidance if the China tariffs that went into effect on February 4, remained at the 10% level for the full year. As Corie stated, a lot of has changed since March. Tariff rates have changed the sourcing exposure for many of our products has been changing and the conversation with our vendors has also progressed. As such, the updated guidance we are providing today includes our best estimate of the range of financial impacts from tariffs.\nWithin that guidance, our working assumption is that tariffs stay at the current levels for the rest of the year. Clearly, the trade policy discussions are ongoing and tariff rates could change. but anchoring our guidance to the current tariff rates felt most appropriate. In addition, our guidance includes our best estimate for each of our revenue categories, which incorporates the trends we have seen year-to-date. Our guidance also assumes that there is no material change in consumer behavior from the trends we have seen in recent quarters.\nOur updated enterprise guidance for fiscal '26 is the following: revenue in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%, adjusted operating income rate of approximately 4.2% and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 25%, which is unchanged from our prior guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.30 and capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, which represents the low end of our prior guidance range. Lastly, we still expect to spend approximately $300 million on share repurchases. Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance.\nWe expect our gross profit rate to be slightly unfavorable to last year, with most of the primary components of our gross profit plan very similar to fiscal '25 from a rate perspective.\nThere are a few items I would like to highlight. First, our product margin rates are now expected to be unfavorable compared to last year, which is largely driven by a higher portion of our sales mix coming from lower margin categories, such as computing. In addition, our outlook reflects our plans to remain competitively priced.\nNext, growth from the Best Buy ads and the rollout of our U.S. marketplace is expected to benefit our gross profit rate. We now expect our services category, including membership that benefit our gross profit rate compared to the prior year.\nLastly, we still expect the profit share on our credit card arrangement to have a neutral impact in fiscal '26. Now moving to our adjusted SG&A expectations.\nAs a percentage of revenue, we now expect our adjusted SG&A to be slightly lower than fiscal '25, which includes the following puts and takes. We continue to expect benefits from ongoing efficiencies and effectiveness work streams, including Best Buy Health. Indirect tax settlement we received in the first quarter lowered our full year SG&A compared to last year. Partially offsetting these items are SG&A increases in support of our Best Buy ads and marketplace initiatives, which includes advertising, technology and employee compensation expense. At the high end of our revenue guidance, the store payroll expense and items like credit card processing fees are expected to increase with minimal impacts from a rate perspective.\nLastly, the high end of our guidance now reflects incentive compensation that is approximately flat to last year. While the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses, including incentive compensation to align with the sales trends.\nBefore I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the second quarter. We expect our second quarter comparable sales to be slightly down versus last year, and our adjusted operating income rate to be approximately 3.6%. Our gross profit rate is planned very similar to last year's second quarter. With increased SG&A expected to be the primary driver of the lower operating income rate.\nAs a reminder, last year's second quarter SG&A included a favorable legal settlement and lower medical claims. The combination of these two items provided the benefit of approximately $20 million to last year's second quarter. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Best Buy's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Jason Bonfig, our Senior Executive Vice President of Customer Offering and fulfillment.\nDuring the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nBeginning this quarter, we have renamed all of our non-GAAP financial measures to adjusted financial measures. For example, non-GAAP SG&A has been renamed to adjusted SG&A. The methodology for calculating these measures remains unchanged, and therefore, any previously reported non-GAAP financial measures that are renamed to corresponding adjusted financial measures remain unchanged.\nIn addition, I want to remind you that fiscal '25 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal '24. We estimate the impact of the extra week in Q4 fiscal '24 added approximately $735 million in revenue, approximately 15 basis points of adjusted operating income rate and approximately $0.30 of adjusted diluted EPS to the full year results.\nComparable sales for the 14-week Q4 fiscal '24 and 53-week fiscal '24 exclude the impact of the extra week. Finally, some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.\nPlease refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. Now I will turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report both better-than-expected sales and earnings for the fourth quarter. We drove positive enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5%. On revenue of almost $14 billion, we delivered an adjusted operating income rate of 4.9% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.58. As we entered fiscal '25, we were operating in an uneven environment and expected there would be industry pressure.\nOur fiscal '25 strategy was to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. And with today's results on a 52-week basis, we are reporting 20 basis points of annual adjusted operating income rate expansion on a 2.3% comparable sales decline, demonstrating our ability to preserve profitability in a softer sales environment.\nThe Q4 holiday promotional environment was in line with our expectations going into the quarter. As we have seen for the past several quarters, customers were deal focused and attracted to more predictable sales moments. We were pleased to see strong customer response to our doorbusters and earlier Black Friday sales. This gave us a running start to the quarter and the strong November comparable sales in a holiday season with fewer shopping days between Black Friday and Christmas Day.\nOur digital sales were almost 40% of total domestic sales this Q4, a slightly higher mix than last year. We saw sales growth across digital assets, including the Best Buy app, which hit the #1 rate shopping app position on the Apple App store on Black Friday this year and saw almost 20% traffic growth. We have very competitive fulfillment options, offering our online customers, on average, a 10% faster promise for delivery this year.\nIn addition, 45% of our online revenue was picked up in our stores by our customers during the quarter, showing the value customers put on the convenience of our stores. From a product category perspective, we drove comparable sales growth in computing, tablets and services. This growth was partially offset by declines in appliances, home theater and gaming.\nWe delivered better-than-expected domestic comparable sales growth of 9% in the combined computing and tablet categories. Laptop sales growth specifically increased to 10% versus 7% growth in Q3. Improved sales performances in headphones and in TVs with the broader -- within the broader home theater category, also added to better sales result compared to the first 3 quarters of the year.\nAs I step back, there are several factors that contributed to our results and set us up well for success in fiscal '26. Our stores reset, enhanced vendor experiences and labor enhancements contributed to material year-over-year improvement in our domestic relationship Net Promoter Score, which tracks consumers' likelihood to recommend Best Buy. The investments we made in both digital and store experiences and associate training helped us optimize the computing, replacement and upgrade cycle to drive sales growth and share in the category.\nIn our digital business, our focus on personalization and speed resulted in app engagement and sales growth. Our investment in marketing and the introduction of our new branding drove traffic and positive lift to brand perception metrics. We successfully tested new targeted promotional strategies that delivered higher engagement across all tiers of our My Best Buy membership. Our prudent and balanced approach to expenses allowed us to invest strategically and our ongoing efforts and investments in onboarding, training and our commitment to creating a stable and engaging environment for our employees contributed to our lowest employee turnover metrics in 6 years and higher engagement scores sequentially and year-over-year.\nWe are encouraged by and proud of our execution and results and I'm beyond grateful for the passion and hard work our team members across the company demonstrate each and every day. As we enter fiscal '26, we are excited to build on the momentum from this past year. Our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position in retail as a leading omnichannel destination for technology expanding our operating income rate, while at the same time, building and scaling new profit streams that we believe will drive robust returns in the future.\nTherefore, our fiscal 2016 priorities are as follows: one, drive omnichannel experience improvements that resonate with our customers; two, launch and scale incremental profit streams, including Best Buy Marketplace and Best Buy Ads, and three, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency to fund strategic investments and offset pressures. Of course, these priorities are intertwined and worked together as a great customer experience drives the level of opportunity to generate incremental profit streams.\nBefore providing more detail on these priorities, I'll share some insights on the assumptions driving our sales expectations. We believe the consumer will remain resilient, but is still dealing with high inflation that is driving expenses up across their lives, making them value focused and thoughtful about big ticket purchases. We also still see a consumer that is willing to spend on high price point products when they need to or when there is technology innovation.\nAfter stabilizing through fiscal '25 we expect the U.S. CE industry to be flattish to slightly up this year. From a category perspective, we expect continued sales growth in computing and improved sales trends across multiple other categories. This leads to our comparable sales guide in the range of flat to 2% growth for the year, with growth weighted more in the second half of the year based on the timing of product launches and initiatives.\nWe expect growth in computing, including tablets, to continue to be driven by the customer need to replace and upgrade products. We believe this will be helped by both the end of Windows 10 product support in October and ongoing innovation in the form of gradual improvement in AI use cases and release of new AI features.\nBeyond computing, we expect other categories to show more stabilization and improved comp sales trends, including home theater, mobile phones and major appliances. Against this backdrop, I need to pause a moment to address the topic of tariffs. International trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical and complex.\nChina and Mexico remain the #1 and #2 sources for products we sell, respectively. While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.\nThe fiscal 2016 guidance we provided this morning does not include the impact of the recently enacted tariffs. This is because it is a highly dynamic situation with uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount and countries involved in addition to the potential action of others in the industry as well as the potential reaction of American consumers.\nThat being said, we believe it is helpful to provide some level of context. Based on our early analysis, if the China tariffs that went into effect on February 4, remain at the 10% level for the full year, we believe they would have a negative impact in the ballpark of 1 point of comparable sales. This would mainly impact quarters 2 through 4.\nI want to stress that our deeply tenured and talented teams are experienced as operating in volatile conditions. And this is also a situation where our partnerships with vendors are extremely valuable. We intend to execute the strategic plan we set for this year while navigating the tariff environment.\nNow I would like to provide more details on this plan and our fiscal '26 strategic priorities. As I mentioned, our first priority is to drive omnichannel experience improvements that resonate with our customers. I will start with our digital experiences where 1/3 of our domestic revenue is transacted and 60% of our purchasers visit at some point during their shopping journey.\nOur first focus for the year is to meaningfully improve our search and discover capability to make it even easier for our customers to find what they want and need. Therefore, we will leverage AI to launch an innovative new search experience across dot-com, small view and the app. We will also build on the foundation we established last year as it relates to personalization, using AI to make the personalization smarter to drive both engagement and conversion. The app is our preferred shopping experience for both our free and pay My Best Buy members, and the personalized home screen was served to members on over 100 million sessions in the fourth quarter, driving measurable improvements in engagement.\nThis spring, we will be introducing Best Buy store fronts that will allow influencers and creators to build their own branded digital storefronts on bestbuy.com, which we expect to drive increased traffic, engagement and sales. Additionally, we will continue to integrate enhanced data and expand video content that improves the customer experience across the shopping journey.\nOur stores are incredibly important for both our customers and our vendors. Customers know they can visit a Best Buy store to see and demo product or talk to a knowledgeable sales associate in ways they can't anywhere else. Overall, our plan for our physical stores is similar to last year. We will prioritize merchandising and store health and appearance updates over large-scale remodels. In doing so, we continue to leverage the valuable insights we've gained from testing and deploying unique solutions within our store portfolio in the past few years.\nFor example, our resets in monitors and digital imaging earlier in the year contributed to sales growth for those categories in the holiday quarter. Throughout the year, we expect to drive shopping experience updates across the chain, including growing vendor pads and home theater, expanding tablet and virtual reality departments and enhancing experiences for expected iconic gaming launches.\nWe will also continue the rollout we began last year of dedicated space to showcase new and emerging tech after seeing positive results for many participating vendors. Many of these planned updates are in partnership with our vendors. They are increasingly investing in our sales floors, both physically and in specialized labor helping us create unique and engaging merchandising for our customers.\nFor example, last year, we repositioned computing to the center of several stores and implemented enhanced Microsoft and Apple experiences, which are already showing promising results. We plan to implement these updates in more stores later this year. We will continue our disciplined annual approach to closing or relocating less profitable locations.\nLast year, in the U.S. we closed 12 traditional big box stores and opened 2 new stores. This year, we expect to close roughly 5 to 10 stores and open a few new smaller format stores. From a labor perspective, in fiscal '26, we will focus on enhancements and optimization, building on the more material changes we have made in the last few years.\nOverall, we were pleased with our decision to add dedicated labor focused on computing, home theater and major appliances in roughly 350 stores. We'll keep refining to boost sales proficiency and customer experience and expand this model to more locations this year. To continue the commitment to driving product knowledge, merchandising excellence and customer engagement, we plan to bring these dedicated associates together for an intensive vendor-supported in-person training and certification program in the spring.\nIn our services business, we expect to update our customer offers for home theater delivery and installation. These new service offers will be simplified from the current state and should make our installation services both more attractive to a wider base of customers and easier to sell, clearly highlighting our most differentiated experiences.\nAdditionally, I will highlight the valuable role that our Geek Squad agents play in times of new technology -- for example, they help customers understand what is unique about Copilot+ AI PCs or why they would want to upgrade their computers as we approach the upcoming Windows 10 upgrade cycle.\nOur second strategic priority for fiscal '26 is focused on incremental profitability stream opportunities. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, we are targeting a midyear launch for our new U.S. Best Buy marketplace. We believe that as the trusted leader in CE, we have an opportunity to leverage our positioning and assets to build a differentiated digital marketplace platform. This will allow us to bring our customers access to much more expansive assortment and new categories without needing to own the inventory.\nIn addition, sellers and advertisers will have an additional avenue to increase their reach and build their brands, leveraging our qualified traffic. We will phase in capabilities over time. For example, we plan to facilitate product returns for our customers at Best Buy stores when we launch the marketplace. We expect to add capabilities such as fulfillment as a service for sellers in a later phase. It is still early in the process and we are pleased with the strong interest from sellers and believe it indicates a promising launch.\nAll potential sellers will go through a vetting process so we can ensure our customers receive the positive experience that they would expect at Best Buy. Our Canada team operates an established growing third-party online marketplace, and we have leveraged their learnings and expertise as we build out our plans. Even with start-up costs, investments and estimated cannibalization of our first-party product revenue, we expect Marketplace to have a positive impact on our operating income rate in fiscal '26.\nOver time, we expect Marketplace to help drive profit dollars and unit share. In addition, it will provide opportunities for Best Buy Ads through new advertisers and increased traffic. We have recently elevated the focus on our Best Buy Ads business and see fiscal '26 as a pivotal year. We've had a robust retail media network business for a long time in partnership with our vendors.\nWe are proud of this business we have built, but the opportunity for further growth. Last fall, we brought in a new leader for the business, Lisa Valentina, who brings more than 20 years of media and advertising leadership experience at firms such as Disney, [indiscernible] and ESPN. We are currently filling other key leadership roles and plan to open a New York office.\nIn fiscal '26, we are investing in capabilities that we believe will unleash growth like competitive market level self-service offerings that allow brands to manage their own advertising buys and new Ads products that will expand inventory and customer reach. We also expect to drive results through agency relationships and the new marketplace I just discussed. In fact, we have just signed our first joint business partnership with one of the largest global holding company. We expect agency partnerships to result in new advertisers and revenue growth over time, leveraging our data targeting, advanced and innovative beta opportunities in areas like commerce, sponsorships and in-store experiences.\nI will add that our membership program plays multiple roles in our business, not only providing unique value to our members, but also serving as a source of growth for our rich first-party data that helps fuel Best Buy Ads. We had approximately 100 million members across 3 tiers: free, My Best Buy membership, Best Buy Plus paid membership and Best Buy Total membership.\nWe ended the year with nearly 8 million paid members, up from 7 million last year. We expect growth in ad collections to contribute to gross profit rate improvement in fiscal '26. From an operating income rate perspective, we expect more of a neutral impact due to the investments we are making. We believe the actions we are taking in fiscal '26 position us for future growth and rate expansion over the next number of years. Our third strategic priority for fiscal '26 is a consistent one. It is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency.\nWe have a long-standing commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies to help fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives and offset inflationary pressures in our business. In our procurement operations, we expect to complete the multiyear deployment of our full source-to-pay technology capability. This will give us expanded transparency into billions of dollars of goods not for resale spend.\nIn combination with the enhanced automation of our purchasing process, this paves the way for continuous cost optimization opportunities. As we have discussed previously, we have been improving our customer service experience and operational efficiency by modernizing our IVR phone system with AI-powered solutions. These advancements intelligently route customers to the right agent reducing friction and improving resolution speed.\nSince implementing AI-powered routing logic, we have achieved a 300 basis point reduction in transfer rates, demonstrating improved accuracy and directing customer inquiries. We also leverage technology to enable seamless self-service options for key functions such as price matching, order status inquiries and membership management. As a result, self-service adoption has doubled with nearly 50% of customers managing their memberships via phone without agent assistance. This shift not only improves customer satisfaction by offering faster, more convenient solutions but also optimizes resource allocation within our support teams going forward.\nIn addition, during the holiday season, we were able to leverage text analytics with 100% of our customer service agent interactions creating a real-time performance dashboard that highlighted top contact drivers and call volume trends and provide daily alerts for anomalies. This allowed us to quickly identify and resolve issues that were affecting multiple customers. In Q1, we will expand this program to chat interactions.\nLast year, we established a digital and technology hub with a partner in Bangalore, India. This year, we will expand the scope of work being performed by our India resources leveraging more economical access to talent and skills. I'd like to take a moment to talk about Best Buy Health.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we recorded an impairment charge to reflect the downward revisions in our longer-term projections. We still believe in the fundamental strategy of leveraging technology to enable care at home and believe it will be important to the future of health care, but the market is not scaling as fast as we originally forecasted. We will continue actions intended to maximize the value and improve the profitability of the business.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our execution and the momentum we built in fiscal '25. We are excited to build on that momentum to bring our fiscal '26 strategy to life while we continue to navigate uncertain circumstances. We often just that we have the luxury of competing with the biggest retailers in the world. Even so, we continue to thrive.\nIt is because we remain committed to our mission to enrich lives through technology. We are the trusted source for the latest and greatest new tech as well as a broad range of assortment, unique in-store and digital experiences and the expert services to help our customers. We are also a true partner to our vendors, often working with them from early in the product development cycle all the way to launching products on our sales floor.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, let me start with how the quarter performed versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.\nOn Enterprise revenue of $13.9 billion, our adjusted operating income rate was 4.9%, both of which exceeded our expectations. Our overall gross profit rate was better than expected which was primarily due to the favorable product margins, whereas adjusted SG&A dollars were unfavorable to our outlook entering the quarter, which was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation.\nI will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. As Mollie stated, this year's fourth quarter included 13 weeks compared to 14 weeks last year. We estimate the extra week was approximately $735 million in revenue and $0.30 of adjusted diluted earnings per share and provided a benefit of approximately 40 basis points to last year's fourth quarter adjusted operating income rate.\nEnterprise revenue increased 0.5% on a comparable basis. Our adjusted operating income rate of 4.9% declined 10 basis points compared to last year. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $2.58. By month, our Enterprise comparable sales were up approximately 4% in November before declining 2% in December and ending January slightly up.\nIn our Domestic segment, comparable sales increased 0.2% and revenue decreased 5.2% to $12.7 billion. The revenue decrease was primarily driven by the lapping of last year's extra week. International comparable sales increased 3.8% and revenue decreased 0.2% versus last year to $1.2 billion. The revenue decrease was largely due to the extra week last year and a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 500 basis points, which were partially offset by revenue from Best Buy Express locations that have opened during fiscal '25.\nOur domestic gross profit rate increased 50 basis points to 20.9%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement within the services category, which includes our membership offerings. This was partially offset by lower credit card profit sharing revenue. Our international gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 21.4%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily due to favorable supply chain expense.\nMoving to SG&A, where our domestic adjusted SG&A decreased $30 million. The decrease was primarily due to the lapping of last year's extra week, which was partially offset by higher incentive compensation and advertising expense. As Corie mentioned, we recorded a goodwill impairment related to Best Buy Health. This totaled $475 million and is excluded from our adjusted earnings.\nDuring fiscal '25, our total capital expenditures were $706 million versus $795 million in fiscal '24. The year-over-year decline was driven by a reduction in both store-related investments and technology, which was partially offset by increased expenditures in Canada. During fiscal '25, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to being a premium dividend payer and this morning announced that we are increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share, which is a 1% increase. This increase represents the 12th straight year we have raised our regular quarterly dividend.\nMoving on to our full year fiscal 2016 financial guidance, which, as Cory mentioned, excludes the impacts of recent tariffs and is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of flat to up 2%; Enterprise adjusted operating income rate in the range of 4.2% to 4.4% and adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.60. Capital expenditures of approximately $700 million to $750 million, and lastly, we expect to spend approximately $300 million on share repurchases with the purchases weighted more heavily to the second half of the year.\nNext, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance. Earlier, Corie provided context on our fiscal 2016 top line assumptions. So let me spend more time on the profitability outlook. We expect our gross profit rate to be in a range of flat to up approximately 20 basis points compared to prior year.\nMost of the primary components of the gross profit are planned very similar to fiscal '25 from a rate perspective. Within our gross profit rate outlook, there are a few items that I would like to highlight. We expect growth from Best Buy Ads and the rollout of our U.S. marketplace to benefit our gross profit rate. Product margin rates are expected to be flat to slightly down when compared to fiscal '25. We expect our services category, including Membership to have a neutral impact to our gross profit rate compared to the prior year.\nAfter being a pressure in fiscal '25, we expect the profit share on our credit card arrangement to have a neutral impact in fiscal '26. Now moving to our adjusted SG&A expectations. As a percentage of revenue, we expect our adjusted SG&A to be approximately flat to fiscal '25, which includes the following puts and takes. SG&A is planned to increase in support of our Best Buy Ads and marketplace initiatives which includes advertising, technology and employee compensation expense.\nWe expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high end of our guidance, assuming an increase of $45 million compared to fiscal '25. Partially offsetting the previous items are expected benefits from ongoing efficiencies and effectiveness work streams, including in Best Buy Health. So our payroll expense and items like credit card processing fees are expected to increase at the high end of our revenue guidance with minimal impacts from a rate perspective. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses, including incentive compensation to align with the sales trends.\nBefore I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We expect our first quarter comparable sales to be slightly down versus last year. We expect our Q1 adjusted operating income rate to be approximately 3.4%, which is 40 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. We expect our gross profit rate to be flat to up 20 basis points, which are aligned with our guide for the full year.\nI will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Best Buy's Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\nI will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our comparable sales performance sequentially improved to a decline of 2.3% compared to our guidance of down 3% and last quarter's decline of 6.1%.\nAt the same time, we delivered a non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1%, which was higher than our guide of 3.5% and due to lower-than-expected SG&A expense. On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP OI rate expanded 30 basis points, largely due to gross profit rate expansion in our membership and services offers. From a category perspective, we drove comparable sales growth in tablets, computing and services. This growth was more than offset by declines in appliances, home theater and gaming. We delivered strong results in our domestic tablet and computing categories, which together posted comparable sales growth of 6% versus last year, with our market position, expert sales associates and compelling merchandising we capitalized on demand driven by our customers' desire to replace or upgrade their products, combined with new innovation.\nOverall, customers remained [ deal ] focused and attracted to more predictable sales moments, with fourth of July, Black Friday in July and the beginning of back-to-school sales events, July comps were the best of the quarter. In this environment, many categories, including major appliances and TVs continue to be very promotional in pursuit of stimulating interest and sales. We were targeted and thoughtful regarding where and when we made our promotional investments, strategically balancing profitability and sales.\nOur omnichannel operations provided strong support for our Q2 online sales, which remained consistent at 32% of domestic revenue. Almost 60% of our packages are delivered or available for pickup within 1 day and more than 40% of our digital sales are picked up in stores by our customers with more than 90% of these orders available within just 30 minutes.\nOur paid membership program continued to drive positive contributions to our results as we grew the base of members and the impacts from the changes we made to the program last year once again delivered better-than-expected profitability. As always, I am grateful for the hard work, dedication and drive our team members across the company showed to deliver these Q2 results. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect our industry to continue to show increasing stabilization.\nLast quarter, we said we were likely trending toward the midpoint of our original comparable sales guidance of flat to down 3%. Today, we are updating our annual sales guidance to a decline in the range of 1.5% to 3%. At the same time, we are raising our earnings per share guidance range as we largely flow through the better-than-expected results of the first half of the year. From a major category standpoint, we continue to expect sales in our computing category and services to show growth for the year, while most other categories are expected to be down for the year, we expect ongoing improvement in their trends at the high end of our annual comp sales guidance.\nFor the third quarter specifically, we expect comparable sales to be down approximately 1% versus last year. Based on our month-to-date performance, we estimate August comparable sales will be approximately flat to last year. We are encouraged by these results and continue to be very thoughtful about the time periods between sales events as well as possible election-related impact to demand in October.\nOur strategic plan and priorities for the year have been built to sharpen our customer experiences and industry positioning while also maintaining our profitability in this still uneven environment. At the beginning of the year, we laid out our fiscal '25 priorities. They are: one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore pilot and drive incremental revenue streams.\nI would like to provide some highlights of our progress. We have initiatives targeting customer experiences across our digital and store channels. We are encouraged by the material sequential and year-over-year improvement in our relationship NPS which tracks consumers' likelihood to recommend Best Buy. In our apps, our increasingly personalized, relevant and motivational content is driving increased engagement with our customers. Testing has shown that customers receiving our personalized homepage are engaging in content, product and tools in our app, almost 70% more than customers who didn't receive it.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the rollout of this personalization to all our app users. We also scaled other new app experiences, including a digital wallet that provides easy access to payment methods, coupons and offers and deal alerts that allow customers to be notified when their favorite products go on sale.\nOutside of the app, we continue to focus on making the mobile shopping experience even better with faster browsing, more sophisticated search and enriched content. During the quarter, we launched a market-leading new experience for our in-home delivery and installation customers. On the day of their appointment, customers can now digitally track the live to-the-minute ETA of their in-home delivery and installation. Already 60% of customers are engaging with the tracking and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only is this a great experience for customers, but it should also lower costs by reducing calls to our customer service team.\nWe are able to offer this new customer experience because of the work we did last year to more efficiently and effectively route all of our in-home delivery and installation trucks using AI technology. In our stores, we are refreshing the fleet to update merchandising presentations across multiple categories. We began in Q2 and will finish in Q3 ahead of the holiday season. Not every store will be touched in the same way, of course, but our plans include optimizing and refreshing mobile phones, headphones, smart home and digital imaging and creating new experiences in tablets and gaming and computing monitors.\nIn the areas completed in Q2, we already can see related sales improvements, particularly in monitors and digital imaging. At the same time, we are updating or creating new branded in-store experiences with our vendor partners, including GoPro, Tesla, Lovesac, Greenworks and Starlink. We are adding a new merchandising solution in hundreds of stores. This is a modular experience that will transition more frequently to provide vendors the opportunity to create a branded stage for new technology solutions and innovation. And of course, we continue to update departments as new products come up. For example, computing looks different than it did 6 months ago as we refreshed the department around copilot Plus.\nTo support the expected growth in customer demand, during the quarter, we added fully dedicated expert labor to our computing department in hundreds of stores. Toward the end of the quarter, we began the process to do the same in our home theater and major appliance department. We have continued the focus on certifications and training for all store employees. Our certifications are earned by department. So if an associate is certified in home theater, for example, it validates his or her ability to effectively utilize the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver an outstanding customer experience.\nEmployees practice with their leader, each other or specialty coaches to role play, receive feedback and ultimately become certified. We continue to see our certified employees on average, drive higher revenue per transaction and stronger overall customer experience ratings compared to noncertified employees. We are ahead of plan, with more than 60% of our sales associates certified in at least 2 categories.\nOur training program provides continuous learning to keep employees updated on new products and technologies. For example, we trained 30,000 sales associates and Geek Squad agents on the new AI technology. Our vendor partnerships are also an important part of the expertise we provide customers in our stores. Last quarter, we announced an expansion of our vendor partnership with Samsung to include vendor-provided expert labor in appliance departments across hundreds of stores.\nMore recently, Verizon, AT&T, TCL, LG and others, have all increased their labor investments in Best Buy store locations. Across our business, we are reinforcing our unique experiences to capitalize on demand we expect for the confluence of replacement, upgrade and innovation in the coming years. In Q2, we believe the growth in laptop sales continued to be largely driven by customers' desire to replace and upgrade their products.\nThe performance of CoPilot Plus in the quarter was in line with our expectations, but at this early point, a small part of the total revenue. We believe we are just at the beginning of the impact of AI on tech innovation and customer demand. For example, the June introduction of the CoPilot Plus laptops was 1 of the first launches with an important AI capability still to be released.\nIn addition, Apple Intelligence has been announced with capabilities and features expected to be released over time that will be available across devices. We believe AI-inspired capabilities and innovation will continue to spread across categories and devices over the next few years. We also believe the role our customers want us to play in their lives has evolved. To bring this to life and to highlight our tech and our unique positioning, we recently kicked off our new branding as we entered back to school. The new branding is centered on creating customer experiences that inspire curiosity and enable discovery and includes asking our customers what it as well as a new tagline, imagine that.\nThis branding reflects the role that Best Buy and our amazing associates play in our customers' research and purchase journey and our training is also focused on bringing these experiences to life. Additionally, along with our new tagline, we're giving our brand a modern look and feel with new colors and a new creative construct, which will be phased in over time.\nWe are making good progress on the second key priority of our fiscal '25 strategy, which is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. As is often the case, much of what we are doing to improve the effectiveness of our customer and employee experiences, also generates efficiencies. The evolution of our store model is a great example. As you may recall, we decreased the store staff and labor hours during the pandemic when we saw more of our revenues structurally shift to our digital channel.\nWe have been iterating ever sense to support the ever-changing customer, balancing our need to react to the sales environment with our desire to provide the experience customers expect. Last year, we took actions to streamline our leadership structure, which has allowed us to shift dollars into more customer-facing sales associate hours in our stores. More recently, during the second quarter, we made changes to our dedicated in-home sales team that helped fund the investments into our home theater and appliances store labor. While in-home consultations continue to be an important competitive advantage, the volumes are not at the level envisioned a few years ago when we expanded the dedicated in-home team.\nTherefore, we both reduced the overall number of employees and brought the home theater and appliances experts back into the stores to better balance steel labor resources and make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop. We are continuing to enhance our labor strategy as some store customers prefer a self-service sales experience, while others want a more guided sales experience.\nWe will continue to leverage the flexible workforce we established during the pandemic with associates that can work across the store, the checkout lanes and the front door, for example. These employees drive efficiencies by flexing where the customer is across categories and function. Based on customer feedback, we know there is an appetite for even more expert [indiscernible] and that is why we are also focused on certifications and adding back zoned labor in key categories.\nThese are just a few examples of how we are constantly driving customer experience improvements as well as effectiveness in our labor model. It is how we have kept our labor rate flat as a percent of sales through the last few years as we experienced revenue declines. And it is how we expect to hold that rate as revenue grows over time. We also continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve efficiencies. For example, in partnership with Google, this quarter, we rolled out enhanced self-service support that leverages a Gen AI-powered virtual assistant to help our customers quickly troubleshoot product issues, make changes to their order delivery and scheduling and even manage their software, Geek Squad subscriptions and membership.\nWe can now help 60% of our chat users solely with this technology without the need for a live customer support person. We are in the early stages of rolling this capability to our IVR phone system, so customers can get their questions answered without having to wait for a live agent. We are, of course, closely observing feedback as we implement these capabilities to ensure we are maintaining a good customer experience. As I take a step back, the technology enhancements and process and groups we have made in our customer service capability in the last 3 years have decreased our cost per customer contact by more than 20%, while improving the customer experience.\nWithin this work, we are very proud to have recently been named a recipient of Forrester's 2024 Technology Strategy Impact Award. This award recognizes our work to use AI to create better, more human experiences for both our customers and employees. Our third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in this environment. We expect our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal '25 will be about $50 million lower than last year at approximately $750 million.\nWe are raising our expectation for share repurchases, from $350 million to $500 million for the year. As we previously discussed, our fourth key priority for fiscal '25 is longer term in nature. We will explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams overseas. This includes our collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 167 small-format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada. These stores previously known as the source, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada, are being rebranded as Best Buy Express.\nWe opened the first store in June, and as of today, we have completed more than 70 implementations. We expect to roll out the rest of the stores by the end of the year. We are providing a curated CE assortment and Geek Squad services as well as supply chain, marketing and e-commerce. Bell is the exclusive telecommunication services provider and is also responsible for the store operating cost of the partnership. This collaboration allows us to expand our presence in malls and in smaller and midsized communities, reaching 61 brand-new markets for Best Buy Canada.\nWe are very encouraged by the results of the 2 pilot stores and proud of the rapid pace with which our teams are implementing locations. Switching to the U.S. We have a team branded Best Buy business that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries, including education, health care and hospitality. This business generates more than $1 billion per year in sales and delivered low single-digit growth in the first half of the year. We have a dedicated online website for business customers, leading to a 60% digital mix of revenue\nIn addition, we expect to increasingly leverage our unique Geek Squad capabilities to provide services like device life cycle management to other businesses. On top of the meaningful growth we have already seen in the services part of this business. In addition, we continue to partner with our vendors in ways that drive incremental revenue streams. We are growing our Partner Plus program, leveraging our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities vendor partners can offer their own online customers the option to conveniently pick up their products at a local Best Buy store or we will ship the product to their customers' home.\nIn addition to our current partners like Samsung, Lenovo, Therabody and Aura we are adding incremental partners to further drive both units and profit growth. In another example, during the quarter, we expanded our multiyear agreement with Amazon to build Insignia and Toshiba branded television with the Fire TV operating system. We're excited Fire TV will be available on all Insignia TVs ranging from the 24-inch model to our largest 85-inch model as well as new screen sizes in the future with more inventory availability across all price points.\nCustomers can also purchase these TVs from us on amazon.com, with the option to conveniently pick up their products at a local Best Buy store. We also have an agreement with Roku to sell their Roku-branded TVs. With this agreement, advertisers can leverage our first-party audiences when buying Roku Media with improved targeting and closed-loop reporting. This gives advertisers a unique opportunity to reach in-market consumers with greater precision within the leading streaming platform.\nBefore I close, I'll turn the call over to Matt. I want to take a moment to recognize our employees for their continued work to support the communities we serve. This summer, we welcomed more than 3,000 kids and teams at Geek Squad Academy camps across the country. These camps provide the opportunity to learn skills on everything from coding, game design, digital music and more. The response within these communities has been incredible and I continue to be inspired and amazed every summer by the work of our Geek Squad agents, employees and volunteers to inspire young minds.\nWe are proud to be named to the 2024 Best Places for high school graduates to start a career [ list ]. A first-of-a-kind ranking released by the American Opportunity Index. And I'm also proud to share that for the tenth consecutive year, Best Buy has been named a best place to work for disability inclusion. Earning a top score of 100% on the 2024 Disability Equality Index.\nIn summary, we executed well in the first half of the year and the sequential improvement in sales supports our belief that this will be a year of increasing stabilization. As we all observed, the broader macro narrative can change often and sometimes quickly. We see a consumer who is seeking value in sales events and 1 who is also willing to spend on high price point products when they need to or when there is new compelling technology. We don't believe anything in our data signals that customer behavior has changed in a way that would make us increasingly cautious. Thus, we are balancing our optimism in both the industry and our positioning with a pragmatic approach to likely uneven customer behavior going forward.\nAs I said earlier, this year, we are focused on continuing to sharpen our customer experiences and industry positioning while expanding our operating margin on a 52-week basis. We intend to strengthen our position in key categories by computing, home theater and major appliances through elevated experiences that capitalize on innovation, pointed marketing spend and sharp front pricing. We are the largest CE specialty retailer with a unique range of product assortment and expert services to help our customers discover how unexpected technology solutions can bring to life what matters to them. We believe we are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal '25 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q2 financial performance and our outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing a few details on our second quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.3 billion declined 2.3% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1% improved 30 basis points compared to last year, which was driven by improvement in our gross profit rate.\nNon-GAAP SG&A dollars were $53 million lower than last year and were flat as a percentage of revenue. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.34. By month, our comparable sales decreased 2% in May and 4% in June. Before improving to be approximately flat in July.\nAs a reminder, our comparable sales are not -- are computed on a like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar weeks following last year's 53rd week year. For the year, we estimate the impact to be immaterial. In the second quarter, the calendar shift benefited our reported comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. The shift negatively impacted our first quarter comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points. We expect it to negatively impact our comparable sales by approximately 20 basis points in the third quarter and 60 basis points in the fourth quarter. Back to our Q2 results. Compared to the outlook we shared and during the quarter, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1% was 60 basis points higher was primarily driven by lower non-GAAP SG&A.\nThe favorable SG&A was primarily due to lower employee benefit expense, which included medical claims, lower technology expense and a favorable legal settlement. Our overall gross profit rate aligned very closely to our expectations with better-than-expected performance in our services category offering, offsetting better performance in our service category offsetting lower product margins.\nNext, I will walk through the details on our second quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 3% to $8.6 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 2.3%. The overall blended average selling price or ASP of our products was higher than last year. The growth was primarily due to an increased mix of units coming from higher ticket items such as laptops, and a lower mix of units coming from lower ticket categories such as movies and gaming software.\nInternational revenue of $665 million decreased 4% driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. A comparable sales decline of 1.8%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 23.5%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvement within our services category, which includes our membership offerings. This was partially offset by lower product margin rates and lower credit card profit sharing revenue.\nConsistent with the past 3 quarters, approximately $20 million of our vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction to cost of sales in the first half of last year. We have now fully lapped the recognition change. Our international gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 23.9%. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates and higher supply chain costs. which were partially offset by growth in the higher-margin services category.\nMoving to SG&A, our domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $46 million, which was driven by lower employee compensation expense and reduced expenses across multiple areas such as vehicle rental costs and credit card fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expense.\nMoving on to our updated full year fiscal '25 guidance for the enterprise, which is the following: revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $41.9 billion, comparable sales decline of 1.5% to 3%; non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 4.1% to 4.2%, a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.10 to $6.35.\nAs Corie mentioned, we are raising our profitability outlook to largely flow through the favorable performance in the first half of the year. The overall drivers of our annual profitability outlook are consistent with our prior guidance. We believe our gross profit rate will expand approximately 35 basis points compared to last year, which aligns with our previous guidance of more than 20 to 30 basis points of expansion. The main drivers are still the following: first, we expect profitability improvement from our services and membership offerings, which is primarily due to the following factors: higher revenue from insulation and delivery services, which were previously included benefits of paid membership, reduced cost to serve due to lower planned volumes for in-home installation and other related services, and higher stand-alone warranty revenue. Second, we expect lower product margin rates for the year, which is primarily driven by price investments and the $40 million vendor support geography item, the first half of the year that I previously mentioned.\nThird, we still expect approximately 20 basis points of pressure from a lower profit share on our credit card arrangement, which is unchanged since the start of the year. We expect to see gross profit rate expansion in the second half of the year, but not as much as we saw in the first half of the year. This is largely because the benefit from our services and membership offerings will be smaller as we lap the major changes to the program at the end of June.\nNext, I will share details on our annual SG&A expectations. The high end of our annual guidance now assumes non-GAAP SG&A dollars declined by approximately 2% compared to last year, which includes the following puts and takes. The benefit of having 1 less week this fiscal year is estimated at $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 as a percentage of sales, which results in lower SG&A dollars compared to last year. Vendor Support geography lowers SG&A by approximately $40 million in the first half of this year.\nIncentive compensation is now expected to be very similar to fiscal '24 at the high end of our guidance range. Partially offsetting the previous items, our advertising expense is still expected to increase by approximately $50 million versus last year, with increased weighted more in the second half of the year. The low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses, which includes incentive compensation to align with sales trends.\nBefore I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the third quarter. We expect a modest sequential improvement in our comparable sales compared to the second quarter. With our Q3 comparable sales plan down approximately 1%. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3.7%.\nI will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.",

Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern standard time today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Head of Investor Relations. You may now begin.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO.\nDuring the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\nI will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting better-than-expected Q1 profitability. Through strong execution, we continue to manage our profitability, while at the same time, preparing for future growth. We progressed against our fiscal '25 priorities, grew our paid membership base, implemented various restructuring actions and drove improvements in our relationship Net Promoter Score and in our operational metrics for most of our prioritized customer experiences.\nThe mix of macro factors continued to create a challenging sales environment for our category during the quarter, and our sales were slightly softer than our expectations. Our Q1 comparable sales declined 6.1% compared to last year, with the largest impacts coming from appliances, home theater, gaming and phones. Services and laptops were areas of growth for the quarter.\nThe Q1 digital sales mix was 31% of domestic sales, similar to last year. Our omnichannel fulfillment experience continues to improve with almost 60% of our packages delivered or available for pickup within 1 day. And 40% of our digital sales are picked up in stores by our customers, with more than 90% of these orders available within just 30 minutes.\nFrom a profitability standpoint, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% expanded 40 basis points compared to last year. This was above our expectations due largely to gross profit rate improvement in our membership and services offers.\nCustomers remain very deal focused and attracted to more predictable sales moments. Our Q1 product margins were relatively stable, even though the environment overall was more promotional than our expectations in terms of both breadth and depth of promotions. We did see variability by category. For example, the major appliances category was materially more promotional in pursuit of stimulating interest and sales. As has been our practice, we were targeted and thoughtful regarding where and when we made our promotional investments.\nThroughout the quarter, our teams were driven and diligent, and I continue to be proud of their performance. I believe it is a testament to our strong culture that our people remain engaged, motivated and passionate about technology and serving our customers while navigating what has been an extended period of dampened demand.\nOur Q1 retail turnover trended down versus last year and remains lower than industry averages and our recent employee engagement survey shows our people have strong levels of connection, engagement and belonging that are at or above the global benchmark.\nAs we look to the rest of the year, we are focused on our strategic plan and priorities while being mindful about the state of the consumer. In February, we said we expect 2024 to be a year of increasing industry stabilization, and we continue to believe that. That being said, clearly, macro factors continue to fluctuate and put pressure on consumer spending.\nThree months ago, there were several indicators showing some favorability, including decreasing inflation, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound. Since then, inflation is still high, mortgage rates are high and consumer confidence scores are trending lower. Consumers continue to make tough choices with their budgets, trading down in some areas while still prioritizing spend in others like services and experiences like travel. This, in combination with the pull forward of tech purchases into the early years of the pandemic and lower levels of material innovation, has led to continued lower demand for higher-ticket consumer electronics and a focus on value and deals for current purchasers.\nWe are not changing our original full year guidance as it is early in the year. The first quarter is a relatively quiet quarter, and we have yet to see the impact of a variety of coming new product launches and innovation. However, at this point in time, it is likely we are trending toward the midpoint of our original comparable sales guidance of flat to down 3%.\nWe are strategically operating our business, balancing our response to the pressured sales environment. Therefore, even at the midpoint of the comparable sales guidance, we expect to deliver profitability towards the high end of our non-GAAP operating income rate guidance. At the same time, we are taking action and investing to sharpen our customer experiences and industry positioning. We know more of our key categories will return to growth. And historically, we outperform when there is more technology innovation, and we leverage our competitive differentiation to provide the best experience for customers.\nFrom a major category standpoint, we continue to expect sales in our computing category to show growth for the full year. We expect revenue for the rest of our product categories as a whole to be down, partially offset by growth of our services revenue.\nAs we plan for the next 3 quarters, we expect our comparable sales performance to sequentially improve. For the second quarter specifically, we expect comparable sales to decline approximately 3% compared to the 6% decline we saw in Q1. Based on month-to-date sales and results, our estimated comparable sales for May are expected to be better than our Q2 guidance. We are encouraged by these results. But from a timing perspective, we don't fully lap last year's Memorial Day sales until our June fiscal week 1, and we continue to be very thoughtful about the time periods between sales events.\nLet's talk about computing and the exciting things happening there. We expect the category to benefit as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum, and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We have seen early signs of improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter, and that trend continued in Q1.\nLast week, Microsoft announced Copilot+ and laptops from Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung are available for preorder on our website right now and will be available on June 18. These devices have faster speed, better battery life, greater efficiency, they are much cooler, and baseline Copilot features like summarization that can quickly recap pages of documents or lengthy e-mail threats.\nThey also have exciting new use cases. For example, there is a recall function that makes it very easy to find documents based on visual cues or help users easily navigate back to a website to find a specific item they shopped for 3 weeks ago. They also have a live language translation function that works real time on videos without requiring a connection to the Internet. And the cocreate capability can take your rough sketches and turn them into works of art.\nTo support these launches, we have built a comprehensive go-to-market plan. At roughly 40 SKUs in total, we expect to have the largest assortment at launch, with more than 40% of the assortment retail exclusive to Best Buy. Working in coordination with our vendor partners, we will have inspirational merchandising and demos of the products in our stores and unique educational and interconnected digital shopping journey. And of course, we have an extensive training program to ensure we leverage our sales associates and [indiscernible] to ensure Best Buy is the destination for unbiased advice and inspiration around how this new tech can enrich their lives.\nThere is additional innovation to drive excitement and interest, including the recently launched Apple iPads, featuring their M4 chips that are already contributing to improved sales trends this quarter. Additionally, we have the new Bose open ear headphones, and Sonos has just announced they are entering the headphone space as well.\nAll these launches are coming just in time for back-to-school, and we expect this drive time to be an important part of the computing story. From July through mid-September, we will have a series of sales events focused on students and their parents that will feature our new brand positioning. We also plan to offer specific deals to our members to drive acquisition and engagement.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are taking action to sharpen our customer experiences and industry positioning while also maintaining our profitability in this environment. Last quarter, we laid out our fiscal '25 priorities. They are: one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore pilot and drive incremental revenue stream.\nI would like to provide some updates on our progress. We are focused on providing increasingly personalized, highly relevant and motivational content as we can attribute roughly 90% of our annual revenue to known customers. I'm particularly excited about the work we are doing with our app as we grow the number of users. Customers who use our app spend more than non-app users.\nDuring Q1, we went live with a personalized home screen powered by AI that is now rolled out to 50% of our app users. Each of these users' home screens look different based on their personal preferences and a number of other factors like current location, shopping history, membership status and what we know they care about the most based on their activity. This could include the newest and hottest deals, latest gadgets from favorite brands, recommendations on products, services or accessories or even a prompt to shop with one of our experts to help them save time. Thus far, customers who receive our personalized homepage are engaging at higher rates than we expected and we are excited to roll the new features to all app users this summer.\nOver the past year, we've also been focused on driving speed improvements on the product pages and in check out in the mobile experience to drive customer experience and sales performance. For example, since starting this work in February, we have driven a 50% reduction in mobile product detail page load time.\nOf course, we are also focused on the customer experience in our stores. From a physical standpoint, we plan to touch every store in the chain in some fashion throughout Q2 and Q3, improving both our merchandising and ease of shopping for customers. This includes improving and livening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the sales floor. It also includes rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we are leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. For example, we will be removing physical media and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home departments.\nWe are excited to partner even more with our vendors this year as it relates to their branded in-store merchandise experiences. Of course, we will see updates in the computing department as we already discussed. We will also see new and enhanced in-store experiences for others, including GoPro, Tesla, Lovesac and Starlink.\nAs we mentioned on our last call, we plan to close 10 to 15 stores for our ongoing review process while opening a few new stores to test concept. For example, in Kansas City, we are replacing a large store with a small format store close by to maximize store retention through convenience. Also later this year, to capture untapped share, we are opening a store in an outstate area where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is currently low.\nWe want to ensure our customers receive the expert service interactions they want and Best Buy is known for when they come to our stores. Extensive training is imperative to that experience. For example, as we prepare for the new launches in computing, we have and will continue to partner with our vendors to train and certify thousands of computing experts in Geek Squad AI Pros.\nIn addition, this month, we added fully dedicated labor expertise to our in-store computing experience in hundreds of stores. We plan to add back fully dedicated expertise in major appliances and home theater departments in stores this summer. These changes are in addition to the actions taken throughout the past year to streamline our leadership model, allowing us to invest in materially more customer-facing sales associate hours in our stores compared to last year.\nWe also continue to partner with our vendors around expert labor. In fact, we have just expanded our vendor partnership with Samsung to include vendor-provided expert labor in appliances departments across hundreds of stores. This appliance labor will be incremental to our own existing labor plans.\nWe are making good progress against our second key priority, to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. Our long-standing commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies is paramount to help offset inflationary pressures in our business and fund investment capacity.\nOur fiscal '25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer care experience. For example, in supply chain, we made enhancements to our systems and process guidelines that reduced TV [indiscernible] in Q1. and we expect the savings to build throughout the year. We also developed a statistical model to identify high return rate products that we leveraged with our major appliance vendors to reduce open box products in the quarter.\nWe will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve these efficiencies. We have already shared how we are leveraging AI to route 95% of our in-home delivery and installation trucks to drive more efficient scheduling and a better customer experience, and how we have begun using AI tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our customer service costs.\nDuring Q1, we announced a partnership with Google Cloud and Accenture to help us further improve the customer and employee experiences in a seamless and human way. Expected to launch late this summer, our enhanced self-service support will leverage a Gen AI-powered virtual assistant to help our customers quickly troubleshoot product issues, make changes to their order delivery and scheduling, and even manage their software Geek Squad subscriptions and membership.\nThis year, we are also taking larger actions to: one, ensure our resources are directed at the right strategic areas; and two, to rightsize our model based on current operations. While we made most of these decisions and booked the associated restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, we are implementing most of the actions in the first half of the year, with some not being implemented until fiscal '26. These actions will allow us to do the following: balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop; redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy; and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago, whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits.\nFor example, last year, we made the decision to remove free installation services from our membership program. This, as expected, led to reduced services fulfillment volume. As a result, during the first quarter, we reduced the number of Geek Squad team members to align our head count to our forecasted demand. This will improve the experience for our remaining employees and allow them to rely on a more consistent schedule and pay.\nOur third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in this environment. We now expect our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal '25 to be approximately $750 million, $50 million lower than last year. This decline is largely due to our decision to concentrate our store capital investments more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels. Our share repurchases are expected to be similar to last year at approximately $350 million. Our annual dividend expense is expected to be approximately $800 million, with our current dividend yield over 5%.\nAs mentioned last quarter, our fourth key priority for fiscal '25 is longer term and focus. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams over time. This includes endeavors like our Best Buy Health business, our collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 165 small-format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada, our [ Geek Squad-as-a-service ] pilots, and our Supply Chain Partner Plus program.\nIt also includes continuing to build out our Best Buy ads capabilities. We have had a robust retail media network business for a long time in partnership with our vendors, and we are expanding our available ad products and improving the advertiser user experience. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with CNET to share inventory across both ad platforms, adding reach and frequency for our brand advertisers along with closed-loop reporting.\nIn addition, customers will see curated content and editorial advice from CNET experts across various Best Buy channels encompassing a variety of product reviews and expert picks that align with their shopping experiences.\nWe also wrote out new self-service reporting capabilities to all vendor ad partners. This will make it even easier for ad customers to engage with us and will provide valuable closed-loop insights on the effectiveness of on-site ad products.\nBefore I close and turn the call over to Matt, I want to take a moment to recognize our employees for their continued work to support the communities we serve. I'm proud to share that we recently opened up 2 new Best Buy team tech centers in Los Angeles and St. Cloud, Minnesota, and have several more set to open later this year. These centers join the Best Buy Foundation's growing network of use centered community hubs where teams have access to the latest technology, learn real-world career skills and interact with supportive mentors.\nWe continue to be recognized as an industry leader in sustainability. For the 11th year in a row, we were named as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. This award reflects our ongoing commitment to help our customers reduce their carbon emissions from ENERGY STAR products. And during this month, we partnered with Microsoft and Junk Kouture to help raise awareness about the importance of responsibly recycling old tech.\nIn summary, we executed well in the first quarter and remain focused on our fiscal '25 priorities. The stickiness of certain macro factors and the ensuing impact on consumer demand for our category has been uneven, but we remain undeterred. We will continue to navigate the environment as we have the last few years while remaining focused and energized about our purpose to enrich lives through technology.\nThere is a lot of time left in the year with exciting new innovation. We hold roughly 1/3 of the U.S. retail sales market share in both computing and televisions, and we intend to strengthen our position in key categories like computing, home theater and major appliances through elevated experiences, pointed marketing spend and sharp pricing.\nWe are the largest CE specialty retailer with a unique range of product assortment and expert services to help humanize tech for every stage of our customers' lives. We believe we are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal '25 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income rate.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 financial performance and our outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing a few details on our first quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion declined 6.1% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% improved 40 basis points compared to last year and included a 60 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate.\nNon-GAAP SG&A dollars were $97 million lower than last year, and increased approximately 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.20. Our comparable sales decreased 4.5% in February and decreased approximately 7% in both March and April. As a reminder, our comparable sales are computed on a like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted in more closely aligned calendar weeks following last year's 53rd year -- or 53rd week year.\nAlthough our sales were softer than we had planned, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% was 40 basis points higher than expected. Our gross profit rate was higher than expected, primarily due to a more favorable gross profit rate in our services category, which includes our membership offerings. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense was also favorable to our expectations, which was driven by lower store payroll and advertising expense.\nNext, I will walk through the details on our first quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 6.8% to $8.2 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.3%. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price or ASPs of our products was higher than last year. The growth was entirely due to an increased mix of units from higher ticket items such as laptops and TVs even though the individual ASPs for both categories were down to last year.\nInternational revenue of $644 million decreased 3.3%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 80 basis points to 23.4%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvements within our services category, which includes our membership offerings. This was partially offset by lower product margin rates and lower credit card profit sharing revenue.\nConsistent with previous 2 quarters, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction in the cost of sales last year. We anticipate similar recognition of this funding in the second quarter of approximately $20 million. And beginning in the third quarter of this year, we fully lapped the recognition change.\nOur international gross profit rate decreased 90 basis points to 22.8%. The lower gross profit rate was primarily driven by lower product margin rates.\nMoving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $98 million, which was driven by, one, lower employee compensation expense, which was primarily store payroll; two, reduced vehicle rental costs; and three, lower expenses across multiple other areas such as advertising and credit card fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher technology expense. During the first quarter, we returned $252 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nMoving on to our full year fiscal '25 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from the start of the year and is the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20.\nAs Corie mentioned, we now believe revenue is trending more towards the midpoint of our annual guidance range, whereas profitability more closely aligns with the high end of our non-GAAP operating income rate guidance. This is due to our expectation for further gross profit rate improvement. We now believe our gross profit rate compared to fiscal '24 will slightly exceed our original outlook of 20 to 30 basis points of expansion.\nThere are 2 key areas that have changed since the start of the year, which are the following. First, the continued profitability improvement of our services and membership offering is now expected to provide more than a 45 basis points of gross profit rate expansion we expected at the beginning of the year. This is primarily due to a lower cost to serve due to lower expected volume for in-home installation and other related services.\nSecond, we now are expecting additional pressure on our product margin rate for the year, which is primarily driven by pricing investments. As I mentioned, the net impact of these 2 items is expected to result in gross profit rate improvement compared to our original guidance. The other gross profit rate drivers of our annual guidance remain unchanged from last quarter, and they are the following.\nWe still expect Best Buy Health to add a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to our enterprise gross profit rate on a year-over-year basis. We still expect approximately 20 basis points of pressure from a lower profit share on our credit card arrangement. The expected pressure in fiscal '25 is primarily due to an expected increase in net credit losses. Estimate does not include potential implications from the proposed late fee regulation changes.\nNow moving to our annual SG&A expectations, which remain unchanged from the start of the year. The high end of our guidance assumes SG&A dollars are similar to fiscal '24, which includes the following puts and takes. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high end of our guidance, assuming an increase of $40 million compared to fiscal '24. We still expect advertising expense to increase by approximately $50 million. Partially offsetting the previous items is the benefit of 1 less week, which is estimated at $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses, which includes incentive compensation to align with the sales trends.\nBefore I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the second quarter. As Corie mentioned, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales will decline by approximately 3%. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3.5% or 30 basis points lower than the prior year comparable period. The lower year-over-year operating income rate is driven by SG&A deleverage as SG&A dollars are expected to be very similar to fiscal '24 second quarter.\nI will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Best Buy's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded for playback and will be available at approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\nI will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm proud of the performance of our teams across the company as they showed resourcefulness, passion and unwavering focus on our customers this past year. Throughout fiscal '24, we demonstrated strong operational execution as we navigated a pressured CE sales environment. This allowed us to deliver annual profitability at the high end of our original guidance range even though sales came in below our original guidance range. Importantly, we grew our paid membership base and drove customer experience improvements in many areas of our business, particularly in services and delivery.\nFor Q4 specifically, we are reporting profitability at the high end of our expectations, with revenue near the middle of our guidance range. Our comparable sales declined 4.8% in the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our gross profit rate 50 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program as well as Best Buy Health. Excluding the impact of the extra week, we lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations.\nAs expected, customers were very deal-focused through the holiday season, and the promotional environment overall was in line with our expectations. While shopping patterns more closely resembled historical holiday periods and Black Friday and Cyber Week performances were in line with our expectations, the sales lull in December was even steeper than we had modeled. Then customer demand strengthened considerably and was higher than we expected during the 4 days before Christmas.\nOur Q4 digital sales mix was flat to last year at 38% of total domestic sales. Customer in-store pickup of online orders was also consistent at 44%. We improved our delivery speeds, expanding the percent of ship-to-home online orders delivered in 2 days. We have been very focused on getting our app in the hands of customers. And I'm pleased to say that on Black Friday, it ranked #3 across shopping apps and #4 across all apps on Apple's App Store.\nWe ended the quarter and year with 7 million members across our 2-tiered My Best Buy paid memberships. Paid members consistently showed higher levels of interaction with comparatively higher levels of spend at Best Buy and a shift of spend away from competitors. From a financial perspective, membership delivered another quarter of higher-than-expected operating income rate contribution. When you include the changes we made to the free tier and the impact of the midyear changes we made to the paid program benefits, our membership program contributed approximately 45 basis points of enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion for the full year.\nAnd our Best Buy Health business achieved its operating income contribution target of 10 basis points for the year. In addition, we announced strategic partnerships with Advocate Health, Geisinger Health and Mass General Brigham, and our care at home platform is now being used in 8 of the top 20 health systems in the U.S.\nNow I would like to look forward to fiscal '25. We expect this to be a year of increasing industry stabilization. Our strategy is to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding, our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. Therefore, our fiscal '25 priorities are as follows: one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore, pilot and drive incremental revenue streams.\nThere's a lot to unpack. I'll start with a discussion about the macro environment, the CE industry and our sales expectations. At the highest level, there have been and continue to be macro pressures impacting retail overall and CE more specifically. First, inflation has been slowing, but prices for the basics like food and lodging are still much higher and consumers have to prioritize and make trade-off spend decisions. Second, there is a consumer propensity to spend on services like concerts and vacations in lieu of goods, which has remained sticky even as the prices there too have inflated. Third, we have a relatively stagnant housing market. Fourth, CE was a significant recipient of a pull forward of demand during the first 2 years of the pandemic. When consumers need to prioritize the basics that usually does not include the product purchases they recently pulled forward. And lastly, the level of CE product innovation has been lowered during the pandemic and supply chain challenged years.\nIt's not so much about each of these individually, but when you stack the five, it has been a heavy weight on the industry. On the positive side, experience tells us that these are all cyclical and transient in nature. And while they are ebbing and flowing, we are optimistic that several indicators will continue to show favorability this year. These include decreasing inflation leading to the lowering of interest rates, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound.\nWe remain confident that our industry will grow again after 2 years of declines. This is simply a matter of the timing. Our underlying thesis is consistent. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products in consumers' homes. Second, we expect to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bot early in the pandemic kick in this year and into the next few years. Third, we are returning to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation after a pause during the pandemic.\nTaking all these factors and considerations into account, we expect fiscal '25 comparable sales to be flat to last year on the high end of our guidance range, down in the first half and up in the second half of the year. The low end of our annual comp sales range is a decline of 3%, reflecting a scenario where the mix of the factors I just discussed results in lower customer demand.\nFrom a category standpoint, we expect sales in our computing category to improve through the year and show growth for the full year as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We are already beginning to see the improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter and are trending positively so far this quarter. At this point in time, we expect revenue for the rest of our product categories to stabilize through the year and be flattish to slightly down for the full year, partially offset by the continued growth of our services revenue.\nEven though overall, we are expecting flattish sales growth for the full year, there are many examples of innovation both already introduced and expected through the year that we believe will drive interest, including the Samsung AI-enabled phone we are already seeing materially more demand than we expected, new emerging content for VR/AR devices, Ray-Ban smart glasses, Bose open year headphones, EV universal charging devices and a proliferation of 98-inch screen TVs, to name a few. Also, the level of exciting and cool new tech at the Consumer Electronics Show in January felt back to normal. Of course, some of that cool new tech hits the market over the following year while some of it is still a few years from consumer launch.\nNow I would like to provide more details on some of the key initiatives within each of our fiscal '25 priorities to capitalize on that industry stability. As I mentioned, our first priority is to invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences. Our first initiative is to materially elevate personalization. We are focused on providing increasingly personalized, highly relevant and motivational content for our known identified customers. We can attribute roughly 90% of our annual revenue to known customers.\nLet's start with our efforts around our paid membership program. Here, we're creating seamless, tailored experiences for our members based on their unique preferences or context. Our app first member deals experience is a great example of this. Rather than bombarding our members with thousands of great member deals, we focus on the experience on the most relevant offers based on their preferences and observed member data.\nAdditionally, we're adding personalization across the membership journey, including in-store at POS, where later this year will include props to provide both sales associates and customers with relevant contextual information about their membership like their savings, rewards, protection plans and offers. We will also include personalized dynamic messaging in our communications to members about their upcoming program renewals. These efforts and more will serve to increase membership engagement and continue to improve retention.\nAs we think about our broader known customer base, we are fortunate to have a tremendous amount of first-party customer data for our advanced analytics capabilities to leverage. While we are elevating personalization across our customer interactions, I'm particularly excited about the work we are doing with our app. We are currently testing a personalization-centric version of the app homepage with the stories and actions that matter most to customers, along with critical content and plan to launch to all customers during the second quarter.\nThe second initiative is to invest back into our store experience. Our stores are crucial assets that provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and convenient multichannel fulfillment. Customer shopping behavior has evolved in the last 4 years. And this year, we are particularly focused on ensuring we provide the experience that customers expect to have when they take the time to come into our stores.\nAs a result, our capital investments for fiscal '25 are concentrated more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels or store openings. We plan to touch every single store in the chain in some fashion, improving both our merchandising and ease of shopping for customers. This includes improving and livening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the sales floor. It also includes rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we're leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. For example, we will be removing physical media and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home departments.\nWe are also excited to partner even more with our vendors this year as it relates to their branded in-store merchandise experiences. The coming innovation, combined with our plan to refresh every store in our fleet, provides much more opportunity for vendor investments in our stores. A few examples I can share at this time include Tesla, Lovesac and Starlink.\nAlthough we still see opportunities for additional large experienced store remodels, we believe we have a better opportunity to improve existing store experiences at scale in fiscal '25. At the same time, we are planning to open a few additional outlet centers and new formats to continue to test 2 important concepts. First, we will open small locations in a couple of out state markets where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low to measure our ability to capture untapped share. Second, we will test our ability to close a large format store and open a small format store nearby, thereby maximizing physical store retention through convenience. These learnings will collectively continue to help us refine our forward-looking store strategy.\nIn addition to a great physical experience, we want to ensure our customers receive the expert service interactions they want and Best Buy is known for when they come to our stores. During fiscal '25, we will continue to leverage our multiskilled store associates, but in hundreds of stores we will also add back fully dedicated expertise in key categories like major appliances, home theater and computing. Our plan is to deploy some of our most skilled sellers against these categories and double down on category-specific training and certifications for these employees. We know that our selling certifications create a better experience for our customers as our certified employees on average drive nearly 15% higher revenue per transaction and garner higher Net Promoter Scores than a noncertified employee.\nIn fact, the third initiative under our drive targeted customer experiences priority is to make sure we are prepared to bring coming innovation to life for customers in ways no one else can. This means we need to be ready to leverage the unique strengths that make us the best place for customers to see new tech and the best partner for vendors to launch new tech. This includes everything from expertly trained associates who can explain the new technology and what it can do for you, the best merchandising presentation both in-store and online, all the way to great trade-in values for customers who use technology. This will be particularly important later this year when more computing products featuring AI are expected to launch.\nAs a reminder, we hold 1/3 of the retail market share in both the U.S. computing and television industries, roughly 20% in gaming and well over 10% share in other categories like major appliances. We intend to strengthen our position in these key categories through the initiatives I just outlined as well as pointed marketing spend and sharp pricing.\nOur second key priority for the year is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. We have a long-standing commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies to help offset inflationary pressures in our business and fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives. Our fiscal '25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely and effectively.\nLet me provide a few specific examples of how we are leveraging it. One, we're using AI to route our in-home delivery and installation trucks to drive more efficient scheduling and a better customer experience. Two, we are leveraging AI to summarize the main points and follow-ups from each of our customer service calls. It also improves the accuracy of the interaction and data collection while reducing average engagement time by almost 5%. To help us enhance our overall tech development effectiveness we are leveraging genAI code generation and shared resources for our engineers. We are also establishing a digital and technology hub in Bangalore, India, which will give us expanded, more economical access to talent and skills. The hub will open and begin the process of onboarding team members later this year.\nIn addition, in fiscal '25, we are taking actions to, one, ensure our resources are directed at the right strategic areas; and two, to rightsize our model based on current operations. These actions will allow us to do the following: balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop, redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago. whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits.\nWhile we made these decisions during the fourth quarter, which resulted in a restructuring charge that Matt will discuss later, many of the actions will be implemented through the first half of fiscal '25 and we will provide more details as we move through the year.\nOur third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. This will include striking the appropriate balance of prioritizing areas that best position us for the future while prudently dealing with the near-term uncertainty in the CE industry. There are a few key points that I want to highlight. First, as it relates to our capital allocation strategy, our overall approach isn't changing. We still plan to first fund operations and investments in areas necessary to grow our business, and next, return excess free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nSecond, while our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal '25 are planned at a similar level to last year, our Domestic segment capital expenditures are expected to decline by approximately $50 million due to the store portfolio investment approach I discussed earlier and lower technology-related expense. This is offset by a year-over-year planned increase in CapEx in Canada to reflect investments for new stores and necessary supply chain automation projects.\nThird, and consistent with our practice over the past several years, we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. Our teams have done a tremendous job managing our inventory in a very uneven sales environment, keeping inventory aligned with our forward-looking sales projections while, at the same time, maintaining as much flexibility as possible.\nAnd lastly, this morning, we announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. This represents the 11th straight year of dividend increases and puts our current dividend yield near 5%.\nOur fourth key priority for fiscal '25 is longer term in focus. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams over time. The most developed example of this is Best Buy Health, where we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad agents to capitalize on growing use of technology to help provide health care in the home. While still very small in relation to our core business, our fiscal '25 Best Buy Health sales are expected to grow faster than the core business, which, combined with cost synergies from fully integrating acquired companies, are expected to drive another 10 basis points of NRI operating income rate expansion.\nAnother example is our recently announced collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 165 small-format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada. These stores, previously known as The Source, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada, will be rebranded as Best Buy Express. We will provide the CE assortment as well as supply chain, marketing and e-commerce. Bell will continue to be the exclusive telecommunication services provider and will also be responsible for the store operating costs and labor components of the partnership. This collaboration will allow us to expand our presence in malls and in smaller and midsized communities across Canada. Best Buy Express stores are expected to roll out during the second half of this year.\nOther examples of opportunities we are pursuing include continuing to build out our business case for Geek Squad as a service and adding vendors to our supply chain partner plus program.\nBefore I close and turn the call over to Matt, I wanted to touch on a few of the ways we are being recognized for the support we provide our employees and communities. From an employee standpoint, I'm proud to share that we continue to maintain industry low turnover rates and our fiscal '24 employee turnover was down on a year-over-year basis. To that end, this is our second year as the #1 retailer on the Just Capital List, which evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., in part on how a company invests in its workforce. This year will also mark the fifth anniversary of our caregiver pay benefit. During that time, we've supported 22,000 employees with almost 3 million hours of time away so they could care for those who matter most.\nWe continue to be credited as a leader in sustainability. In Q4, for the 13th year, we were named to the annual Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We were also just named, for the seventh consecutive year, to the CDP's prestigious Climate A List, which looks at how organizations demonstrate best practices associated with environmental leadership.\nIn summary, we are focused and energized about delivering on our purpose to Enrich Lives through Technology in a vibrant, always changing industry. We don't assort tech products just for the sake of technology. We see technology and service of humans. And as the largest CE specialty retailer with our unique range of product assortment and expert services, we deliver that human experience to millions of customers.\nI want to reiterate our fiscal '25 strategy in what we expect to be a year of increasing industry stabilization we are focused on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. We are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal '25 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income rate.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q4 financial performance and our outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Before getting into our quarterly results, let me start by sharing a few details on the extra week that occurred in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra week added approximately $735 million in enterprise revenue and approximately $0.30 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the quarter. Also as a reminder, revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculation.\nNext, I will share details on the fourth quarter results including the extra week. Enterprise revenue of $14.6 billion declined 4.8% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% improved 20 basis points compared to last year and included a 50 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $30 million higher than last year and increased approximately 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.72.\nWhen viewing our performance compared to our expectations, revenue was near the midpoint of our guidance. As Corie mentioned, our comparable sales trends were not linear, with the more traditional holiday shopping days being our strongest from a growth perspective. Our comparable sales by month were November, down 5%; December, down 2%; and January, down 12%. Although our sales were near the midpoint of our guidance, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% was at the high end. Our gross profit rate was higher than we expected, primarily driven by a more favorable gross profit rate in our services category, which includes our membership offerings. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense was near the high end of our expectations due to additional incentive compensation.\nNext, I will walk through the details of our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 0.9% to $13.4 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.1% and was partially offset by approximately $675 million in revenue from the extra week. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were home theater, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was slightly higher than last year. The growth was primarily due to an increased mix of units coming from higher ticket items such as notebooks and TVs, even though the individual ASPs for both of those categories were down year-over-year.\nInternational revenue of $1.2 billion increased 2.7%, primarily driven by approximately $60 million of revenue from the extra week, which was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.4%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 60 basis points to 20.4%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvements from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. In addition, a higher gross profit rate from our Best Buy Health initiatives also contributed to the improved rate. The previous items were partially offset by lower product margin rates.\nConsistent with the third quarter, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction to cost of sales last year. We anticipate a similar recognition of this funding in the first half of fiscal '25 or approximately $20 million a quarter.\nMoving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $17 million, which was primarily driven by the extra week and higher incentive compensation, which were partially offset by lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising expense. Our International non-GAAP SG&A increased $13 million, which was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and the extra week. In the fourth quarter, as Corie alluded to, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs. The related actions span multiple areas across our organization and include approximately $65 million for actions that won't be implemented until fiscal '26.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 4% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During fiscal '24, our total capital expenditures were $795 million versus $930 million in fiscal '23. The largest drivers of the year-over-year decline was a reduction in store-related investments. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nMoving on to our full year fiscal '25 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%, which compares to an estimated 4%; a non-GAAP operating income rate for fiscal '24 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20. In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million to $800 million. And lastly, we expect to spend approximately $350 million on share repurchases, which is similar to our fiscal '24 spend.\nNext, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance. As our ongoing practice, we will continue to close existing traditional stores during our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. In fiscal '24, we closed 24 stores. And in fiscal '25, we expect to close 10 to 15 stores.\nEarlier, Corie provided context on our fiscal '25 top line assumptions. Let me spend more time on the profitability outlook. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 20 to 30 basis points compared to fiscal '24 due to the following actions and initiatives. First, continued profitability improvements of our services and membership offerings is expected to provide approximately 45 basis points of gross profit rate expansion. The achievement of this improved improvement essentially recoups the original investment of our previous total tech offering that was scaled nationally in October of 2021.\nThe expected rate improvement is due to higher revenue from installation and delivery services, which were previously included benefits of paid membership and a lower cost to serve due to lower expected volume for in-home installation and other related services. The unit volume of these services is still expected to be above pre-pandemic levels but below the elevated levels we experienced when total tech members receive them as a benefit at no incremental cost. We also expect Best Buy Health to add a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to our profit -- gross profit rate on a year-over-year basis.\nPartially offsetting the previous items is approximately 20 basis points expected pressure from a lower profit share on a credit card arrangement. In fiscal '24, our profit share was approximately 1.4% of domestic revenue, consistent with fiscal '23. The expected pressure in fiscal '25 is primarily due to expected increases in net credit losses. This estimate does not include implications from any proposed changes to late fee regulation. We also expect that our product margin rates will experience slight pressure.\nNow moving to our SG&A expectations. The high end of our guidance assumes SG&A dollars are similar to fiscal '24, which includes the following puts and takes. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high end of our guidance assuming an increase of $40 million compared to fiscal '24. We expect advertising expense to increase by approximately $50 million. Partially offsetting previous items is the benefit of 1 less week, which is estimated at approximately $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends.\nBefore I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 5%, which aligns with our estimated February performance. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 first quarter rate of 3.4%. We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, in line with the 20 to 30 basis point improvement we are expecting for the full year. SG&A dollars are expected to decline as a percentage in the low single-digit range with the decrease primarily due to lower store payroll expense.\nI will now turn the call over to operator for questions.",

Welcome to the Best Buy's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available for by approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the third quarter, we are reporting better-than-expected profitability on slightly softer-than-expected revenue. Specifically, we are reporting a comparable sales decline of 6.9%, which is slightly below our outlook for the quarter as consumer demand softened through the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our Q3 gross profit rate 90 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program and better product margins. We also lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations.\nDuring the quarter, we grew our paid membership base and drove meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction scores across many of our service offerings, including in-home delivery, in-store services and remote support.\nOur Q3 results demonstrate our ongoing strong operational execution as we navigate through the sales pressure our industry has been experiencing for the past several quarters. The sales pressure is due to many factors, including the pandemic pull forward of tech purchases; the shift back into services outside the home, like travel and entertainment; and inflation. In the more recent macro environment, consumer demand has been even more uneven and difficult to predict. Based on the sales trends in Q3 and so far in November, we believe it is prudent to lower our revenue outlook for Q4. But despite the lower sales outlook, the midpoint of our annual EPS guidance is now slightly higher than the midpoint of our original guidance as we entered the year.\nI want to thank our associates for their resilience and relentless focus on our customers. I continue to be so very proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future.\nNow I would like to provide more color on our Q3 performance and holiday plans before passing the call off to Matt for the financial details on the quarter and our outlook. We continue to strategically manage our promotional plan, and we're price competitive in an environment where consumers are very deal focused and making spend trade-offs right for their budget. Consumers are looking for value, and from an industry themes perspective, we are seeing some trade down in the television category, but not as much trade down in other categories. As a result and as expected, the level of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and pre-pandemic fiscal '20.\nSimilar to the first half of the year, during Q3, our purchasing customers were relatively consistent in terms of demographics versus last year. As a reminder, we over-indexed with higher income consumers compared to the general population, and we saw the percent of revenue categorized as premium and the percent of purchases over $1,000 remain constant versus last year. We have largely maintained our year-to-date industry share in our [ Sircana ], formerly NPD tracked categories. Against this backdrop, our focus on deepening relationships with customers remains crucial.\nOur membership program delivered another quarter of growth and improved profitability versus last year. The Q3 contribution to the enterprise operating income rate was larger than expected due to the combination of a lower cost to serve and higher paid in-home installation services. For the full year of fiscal '24, we now expect our 3-tiered membership program to contribute approximately 30 basis points of enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion. It is still early since we introduced material changes in June, but there are a number of insights I would like to share.\nOne, we continue to increase our paid membership base and now have 6.6 million members. This compares to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During the third quarter, we signed up approximately 35% more new paid members compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by the addition of the new tier and buoyed by back-to-school and October's member month events.\nTwo, our paid members continue to interact with the brand and shop more frequently compared to nonmembers, which is the goal of any membership program.\nThree, and though it is early and we have not yet lapped the new programs, retention rates are outperforming expectations. Four, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total tech offer, continues to resonate more strongly in our physical store setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchase them. It also includes up to 2 years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases and includes all the benefits of My Best Buy Plus.\nAnd five, our My Best Buy Plus is resonating more with the digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments. This is the new tier for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly anticipated product releases. They also get free 2-day shipping and an extended 60-day return and exchange window on most products. We are still early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers as well as continuously improving digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Of course, we also have a free membership tier that enables free shipping for everyone, a great differentiator, especially in the holiday season.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to evolve our omnichannel capabilities to support our strategy and easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert consultation and service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Last month, we introduced Best Buy Drops, which is a new experience only available through the Best Buy app. It gives customers the opportunity to access product releases, limited edition items, launches and deals from a variety of categories. There are multiple drops nearly every week, and they're only available in limited quantities. We are encouraged by the early results as Best Buy Drops is driving both incremental customer app downloads and higher frequency of app visits.\nWe have also seen growth in sales from customers who are getting help from our virtual sales associates. These interactions, which can be via phone, chat or our virtual store, drive much higher conversion rates and average order values than our general dot.com levels. This quarter, we had 140,000 customer interactions by a video chat with associates, specifically out of our virtual store locations. As a reminder, this is a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that are staffed with dedicated associates and no physical customers. We also teamed up with live shopping platform Talk Shop Live, to test a series of online shopping events this month, starring our virtual sales associates. These events feature products from some of our newer categories like beauty and wellness as well as new tech and unique products. Our physical store portfolio is one of our key assets, and the role of our stores is to provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need some stores to be more cost and capital efficient to operate. As a reminder, while almost 1/3 of our domestic sales are online, 43% of those sales were picked up in one of our stores by customers in Q3. And and most customers shop us in multiple channels.\nConsistent with our normal cadence, we have largely completed the changes to our store portfolio for the year, so we can focus on the holiday season with minimal disruption to our physical stores. As we think about next year with the current economic backdrop, we plan to spend more of our capital expenditures, refreshing a greater number of our stores and less on large-scale remodels. As such, we have 3 priorities for our U.S. store fleet in the near term.\nNumber one, we are refreshing our stores with a particular focus on improving enlivening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, this year, in all our stores, we installed new premium end caps in partnership with key vendors that improve the merchandising in the center of the store. This year, we installed up to 10 of these new end caps per store or roughly 1/3 of our end caps per store and plan to add more next year as we work to upgrade these crucial locations in our stores.\nIn addition, this year, we rightsized our traditional gaming spaces in roughly half of our stores to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as Greenworks cordless power tools, wellness products like the ring, Epson, short throw projectors, e-bikes and scooters and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market share growth. And as always, we continue to work closely with our vendor partners to add experiences to our stores. For example, LEGO and Therabody invested in new shop-in-shops in all our 35,000 square foot experience stores.\nIn addition, and as you would expect, many of our premium partners are continuously updating their in-store spaces to reflect their latest innovations. We will continue this work next year in all our stores, rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we are leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible.\nOur second priority is to keep investing in formats we know drive returns. This year, we implemented 8 large format 35,000 square foot experienced store remodels for a total of 54 and will end the year with 23 outlet stores. At this point in time, we plan to implement a minimal number of remodels and outlets next year.\nAnd the third priority is to open a few smaller footprint stores to keep testing our hypothesis at physical points of presence matter, and we need less selling square footage and more fulfillment and inventory holding space. In addition, we plan to open a few smaller stores in outstate markets to test the impact of adding new locations and geographies where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low. At the same time, we also continue to close existing traditional stores as a result of our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. This year, we have closed 24 stores. Over the past 5 years, we have closed approximately 100 Best Buy stores, which is a 10% decline in store count during that time frame. And we expect to close roughly 15 to 20 stores per year in the near term.\nWe have been enhancing our supply chain network to support these footprint changes and deliver speed, predictability and choice to our customers. For example, we have worked to optimize our ship-from-store hub footprint to maintain substantial coverage for faster offers and take shipping volume pressure off the majority of the stores to allow them to focus on in-store and pickup experiences. Additionally, we are optimizing our shipping locations to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness while still delivering with speed. And as a result, in Q3, we had the lowest ship from store volume as a percent of total since well before the pandemic, with approximately 62% of e-commerce small packages delivered to customers from automated distribution centers. We also continue to augment our own supply chain through other partners and launched Best Buy on DoorDash marketplace, offering our second scheduled parcel delivery option in addition to Instacart Marketplace.\nAs we have discussed previously, we have made strategic structural changes to our store operating model over the past few years to adjust to the shifts we have seen in customer shopping behavior and our corresponding operational needs. These changes provide more flexibility and have allowed us to flex labor hours with the fluctuations in customer sales, shopping preferences like curbside and traffic. As a result, we kept our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. As you can imagine, there is a delicate balance to maintain while we adjust our store operating model as the expert service our associates provide customers is a core competitive advantage. We keep a very close watch on our customer satisfaction trends to make sure we are not negatively impacting the customer experience. Broadly, I am proud that the team is doing this work while driving higher purchasing customer NPS for associate availability, product availability and pricing.\nWe are also committed, of course, to providing a great employee experience through training opportunities and benefits. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now led thousands of our sales associates through a certification process focused on our foundational retail excellence. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost-effective ways. A great example is our app built for employees called Solution Sidekick, that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and locations. Our employees have embraced solution Sidekick and we can see higher customer NPS when our employees are utilizing the app in their interactions with customers.\nWe are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. Our average tenure, excluding our seasonal workforce, for field employees is just under 5 years, and our general manager tenure is almost 16 years. This is crucial as we can directly tie tenured experience and training certifications to NPS improvement over time. We have also seen a strong pool of applicants for new associates to supplement our store teams this holiday season.\nAs you all have likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun. Since we are preparing for a customer who is very deal focused, we expect shopping patterns will look even more similar to historical holiday periods than they did last year with customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last 2 weeks of December. From an inventory perspective, we expect to have strong product availability across categories this year. We will continue to manage inventory strategically to maximize our ability to flex with customer demand.\nWe are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all customers and budgets, including special promotions and early access to deals for our My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members. We have curated gift list to help everyone find the perfect gift. We also introduced a new resource on bestbuy.com and the Best Buy app called Yes Best Buy where customers can find the latest in tech and gifting, like pet tech, baby tech or electric vehicle chargers, all the way to unique products, some shoppers may not know we sell like skin treatments, toys for all ages and electric outdoor power equipment. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we've extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. And this year, for the first time, we also extended that our shoppers can connect directly with one of our virtual sales experts to get help with their holiday shopping. We're also offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items in addition to convenience store and curbside pickup options. Most orders placed on bestbuy.com or through the Best Buy app are ready for store pickup within 1 hour. Same-day delivery is also available on most products for a small fee.\nFrom a merchandising perspective, we're excited for shoppers to see new innovation in a variety of categories, including AI-powered devices like Microsoft CoPilot and Windows 11 computers, the latest in virtual and mixed reality with Meta Class III or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, immersive audio with Bose Quiet Comfort ultra-headphones and more. and we can help our holiday shoppers take advantage of this new innovation through our trade-in program, which gives the customer value for their old technology.\nIn addition to great deals for our flagship categories like computing, home theater and gaming, that feature our unique ability to showcase higher-end technologies at great value, we also have an expanded assortment of new and growing categories, including e-transportation, health and wellness and outdoor living. Our e-transportation assortment has more options for people of all ages and skill levels. We have twice as many outdoor cooking brands compared to last year and more than 5,000 health and wellness products, including a lineup of fitness, recovery, beauty, skin care, baby tech and more.\nAs you can likely hear, we are very excited to provide customers an amazing experience this holiday season. Of course, the macro environment remains uncertain with some tailwinds and increasingly more headwinds, all contributing uneven impacts on consumers. The job market remains strong and upper income and older demographics, in particular, continue to benefit from excess savings. Overarchingly, the consumer is still spending. But as we have said before, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their households. Given the sustained inflationary pressure on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging and the ongoing preference towards services spending, like restaurants, concert tickets indications. Additional indicators have continued to soften, including declining consumer confidence increasing debt and waning savings, and we saw sales trends soften as we move through the quarter. This environment continues to make it challenging to predict shopping behavior even during the most exciting time of the year.\nWhile we are lowering our Q4 sales outlook, we have a wide range to allow for a number of scenarios and the mid- to high end of the range reflects sequential improvement. As we discussed on our last call, there are several factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales can improve. We expect home theater year-over-year performance to improve as we expect to be better positioned with inventory across all price points and budgets than last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our TV units as they grew in Q2 and Q3 and are expected to grow in Q4. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build on our position of strength in the premium assortment. Notebook units were flat compared to last year in Q2, down as expected in Q3 and expected to be up slightly in Q4. And we expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there are strong new software titles.\nIn summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continues to drive volatility, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve. And we remain incredibly confident about our future opportunities. After 2 years of declines, we believe the consumer electronics industry should see more stabilization next year and possibly growth in the back half of the year. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years, benefiting from a materially larger installed base and the ongoing desire and need to replace technology as it ages.\nMuch of this replacement is spurred by innovation, and in addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access and, of course, generative AI, where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement.\nOur purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant today than ever. We're the largest CE specialty retailer. We continue to hold 1/3 of the market share in both the U.S. computing and television industries and we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter results our fiscal '24 outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.8 billion declined 6.9% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% declined 10 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $57 million lower than last year, and it increased approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 90 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 6.5% to $1.29.\nWhen viewing our performance compared to our expectations, we did not see the sequential improvement versus the second quarter that our third quarter outlook assumed. From an enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, August decline of approximately 6% was our best performing month, with September down 7% and October, down 8%. Although our sales were below plan, our non-GAAP operating income rate exceeded our outlook by approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower SG&A. The lower-than-expected SG&A was largely driven by tighter expense management in areas such as store payroll and advertising expense as we adjusted plans to account for sales trends. Our gross profit rate was essentially flat to our expectations. Lastly, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A while our outlook assumed it would have been a reduction of cost of sales. We anticipate similar recognition of this funding in Q4 in the range of $15 million to $20 million.\nNext, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.2% to $9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 7.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, computing, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was essentially flat to last year, which is a slight improvement relative to the past few quarters. In our International segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and a negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 22.9%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by the following: first, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category; second, our product margin rates improved versus last year, including a higher level of vendor-supported promotions and the benefit from optimization efforts across multiple areas; and third, lower supply chain costs.\nBefore moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which performed better than we expected in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the profit share has been approximately flat from a dollar perspective over the course of the year, which has resulted in a slightly positive impact to our gross profit rate. In the fourth quarter, we expect the profit share to come in better than we had expected and once again be very similar to last year from a dollar perspective. As we look to next year, we expect the credit card profit share to be a pressure to our gross profit rate. At this point in time, we expect this pressure to be offset by continued financial improvement from our membership offerings.\nMoving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $58 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation.\nNext, let me touch on our inventory balance. Similar to last year at this time, we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Our quarter end inventory balance was approximately 4% higher than last year's comparable period. As we noted during last year's third quarter earnings call, approximately $600 million of inventory receipts came in a few days later than we had expected, moving from October into November. Adjusting for that timing shift, this year's ending inventory balance would have been approximately 4% lower than last year's targeted ending balance.\nYear-to-date, we've returned a total of $873 million to shareholders through dividends of $603 million and share repurchases of $270 million. We now expect share repurchases of approximately $350 million for the year.\nLet me next share more color on our outlook for the year, starting with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. From a top line perspective, we now expect our fourth quarter comparable sales to be down in the range of 3% to 7%. Our Enterprise comparable sales through the first 3 weeks of November are near the low end of the fourth quarter range. On the profitability side, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be in the range of 4.7% to 5%, which compares to a rate of 4.8% last year. Our fourth quarter gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year by approximately 30 basis points. Although favorable to last year, the year-over-year improvement is less than the 90 basis points of expansion we reported for the third quarter.\nFrom a sequential standpoint, there are 3 main items I would highlight that are expected to reduce the rate expansion in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. First, although it is still a benefit compared to last year, the changes to our membership offering are less impactful in the larger holiday quarter. Second, product margin rates are expected to be closer to flat to last year in the fourth quarter compared to a benefit in the third quarter. And third, we expect supply chain cost to be a slight pressure in the fourth quarter versus a benefit in the third quarter.\nFrom an SG&A standpoint, when comparing to last year, we expect our fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales to be more favorable than our year-to-date trends, which is due in part to the impact of the extra week this year. The range of SG&A implied in the fourth quarter incorporates our normal course of actions to adjust variable expenses under the different revenue scenarios as well as adjustments to incentive compensation align with our expected financial outcomes. As a reminder, we expect the extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million in SG&A we still expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points.\nLet me provide more details on our full year guidance, which incorporates the color I just shared on the fourth quarter. We now expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.7 billion, Enterprise comparable sales to decline 6% to 7.5%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 4% to 4.1%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6 to $6.30, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24%, and lastly, our interest income is still expected to exceed interest expense this year. Our full year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions remain very similar to what we shared last quarter.\nAnd some of the key callouts are the following: we still expect our gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23. A large driver of the gross profit rate improvement is expected to come from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide approximately 35 basis points of improvement. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 95 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we lapped up very low levels last year. The high end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $140 million compared to fiscal '23.\nAnd I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

    "content": "Half Year 2024 Balfour Beatty PLC Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2024 Balfour Beatty PLC Earnings Call\n\nBBYLONDONAUG 14, 5:00 AM\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nI bet seeing that makes you want to pull on a pair of wellingtons or a fluorescent jacket, doesn't it. It's very impressive given what we see in the market, we could probably give you a job as well this moment in time. I'm Leo Quinn, Chief Executive. This is the first half results. I'm joined by the very famous infamous Finance Director, Phil Harrison, who's here to accompany me today. And I think we've got a really exciting ride with these numbers.\nFirst and foremost, the 1 word for me that characterizes where the business is at this moment in time and these results is momentum. What we're seeing is real momentum in terms of earnings growth, in terms of bookings growth and in terms of shareholder returns. And why is that? Well, first of almost, Balfour Beatty is uniquely positioned just at this window in time whereby the rising demand that we're seeing is uniquely matched to our capabilities. So it's a little bit like being in the right place at the right time to deliver the market needs.\nSecondly, we're facing into a market which is actually constrained both in terms of capability and people in terms of numbers. And when that happens, what we actually find is that prices and costs rise, but risk also reduces. So our challenge going forward for me is I'm focused totally on how do we grow earnings. I'm not interested in growing our top line, i.e., our bookings and our revenue. For me, it's really about being selective. And what's important is actually how do we determine that we ensure the earnings grow and that we get profitable growth. And if we deliver that, we'll end up with cash-back profits, which will actually then fund what effectively is our dividend and our shareholder return after our first priority was ensuring that we fund the business properly in order to actually deliver on this growth.\nSo there's real momentum happening at this moment in time. And what's behind that? Look, first and foremost, what we've been doing to shape the market long before the election was we published our blueprint for growth. And this was a document which was put together by the industry participants, both the design and actually the delivery side. And it was really around what are those things that government needs to do to fulfill its ambition to grow the U.K. economy. And now we've got labor in the power seat. They're talking about growth. And all the enablers they are talking about or will match what we were actually espousing in our blueprint for growth, such things as fixing planning, which I'm sure you've heard, things about skills and the apprenticeship levy, things around leveraging private finance. All of those things actually are the things that we need in order to grow the economy. It's quite interesting if they actually are successful in achieving all of those things, it's going to give us a bigger headache in terms of how we [indiscernible] with the demand. And the areas that the government is focused on and the reasons why is, first and foremost is energy. And I'll touch on this in great detail later in my slides.\nBut the fact of the matter is low-cost energy is going to empower the next industrial revolution, whether it be data centers and AI. So there's a real need as to why we get this. Transportation is actually going to lower carbon and the idea of a 0 carbon footprint will happen through what we do to decarbonize transportation. And defense is quite simply about keeping our nation safe. We're heavily invested in all of those areas, and those are 3 of the primary government priorities. And why are we going to win in these markets. First and foremost, we have the largest resource for power, power transmission and cabling in the U.K. We've worked with the likes of National Grid for 100 years, and that's actually real contracting with them. So we're well established.\nIn terms of transportation, we have leading positions in terms of Rose and rail were National Highways largest supplier. And in terms of defense, we have a 20-year track record, and we have great capability in nuclear, which is becoming a very important area, which I'll touch on later.\nSo let's spend a few seconds and sort of, well, sounds interesting, and that's the strategy. What have we actually done and what are we actually doing? So I look at energy security. First and foremost, we have major activity going on with both SSE and National Grid. So if you look at Scotland and you look at sky, we're in an early contractor involvement arrangement with SSE around specking out what would be at least GBP 1 billion worth of transmission business. We're also doing the same with the [indiscernible] to Peter head and then Peter head to South. Put those 2 projects together, the minimum value associated with that is actually at least GBP 2 billion. If you look down to -- into England and you start looking at the Suffolk area, I'm pretty confident within the next 30 days or so, we'll register probably something in the order of another GBP 600 million to GBP 700 million worth of work. We're working with the likes of BP and others on net 0 T side.\nIn terms of transportation, obviously, the capability and skills we have on HS2, which is now about 50% complete, really actually supports all the other activities around we've won the A9. We're working on finalizing the A57. There's a lot of work going on in transportation. We're looking at -- in the rail area, we're looking at things like the Midland Hub, the Midland Mainline. All of these projects are really vital to actually leveling up in the economy. The biggest and single most important project, I think, to growth in the U.K. is a lower terms crossing. Effectively, that's the road it will connect Europe to the north and actually mitigate the risk in the darker tunnel, which is actually a serious risk to the country.\nIn terms of defense, obviously, we continue to work with AWE in the nuclear area. And then in the case of Rolls-Royce, we've recently won what is the preferred contractor to work with them on their ARCUS program. which is sub GBP 1 billion. And then in the U.S. in terms of buildings, great strides in terms of airports, schools, prisons and the likes of that. And we're seeing a very frothy U.S. backlog which I'll talk more about in later slides. So in effect, real business happening in power and transmission, roads has been driven by 0 carbon. Defense is keeping us secure and buildings in the U.S. is a strong market for us.\nAnd on that note, I'll hand over to Phil to look at some of the facts.\n\nPhilip J. Harrison\n\nCFO & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThanks, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the headline numbers. Revenue grew by 3% in the first half to GBP 4.7 billion which was a 5% increase when excluding foreign exchange movements. Profit from earnings-based businesses increased by 6%, with strong profit growth in U.K. Construction and Support Services. Group profit from operations reduced by 4% due to higher costs in the investments business. Profit for the period increased by 9% to GBP 81 million which included a lower tax charge due to a change in profit mix and earnings per share increased by 18% to 15.3p which includes the benefit of a lower share count given the group's ongoing share buyback program. Our GBP 16.6 billion order book has increased slightly in the period and the direct valuation of the infrastructure portfolio increased by 5% to GBP 1.3 billion. Prairie then cash reduced as expected, with working capital outflowing as forecast and average net cash increased to GBP 735 million. The board have increased the interim dividend per share by 9% to 3.8p, and we remain on track to deliver full year earnings growth.\nMoving on to the business units. Let me start with Construction Services, which delivered profit growth of 3% in the first half U.K. construction revenue was 4% lower due in part of volumes of work at Hinkley Point C, which are now reducing given the progress made on the project. The business continued on its path to improved PFO margins, moving from 2% to 2.3% and increasing PFO by 13%. This improvement is a result of our better operational performance from the business and the lower risk nature of the contracts being undertaken. U.S. construction PFO reduced in the first half as we indicated it would at year-end due to a small number of civil projects, which have been impacted by delays.\nThe U.S. buildings business has been performing well and grew revenue by 5% in the first half. For the full year, we continue to expect U.S. Construction's PFO to be in line with 2023.\nAt Gammon, revenue increased by 22% due to higher volumes from the major Hong Kong airport projects and PFO increased by 7% to GBP 15 million. The PFO margin percentage reduced due to timing of profit recognition on contracts and is expected to improve for the full year.\nMoving on to Support Services, which comprises our power transmission, road and rare maintenance businesses, all of which performed well in the first half. Revenue increased by 20% and due to higher volumes of road maintenance work. As a reminder, we started 2 new road project contracts towards the end of the first half last year, having a full period of those up and running has contributed to higher volumes. We also saw a spike in the demand for road surfacing works in a lead up to local and national elections. As a result, profit for the period increased 13% and to GBP 34 million.\nFor the full year, we expect PFO margin to be towards the top of the targeted 6% to 8% range, driven by the second half mix of work being more evenly weighted between power transmission, road and rail maintenance.\nFinally, we've seen an increase in the support services order book in the first half as we begin to book the first of the power transmission orders which will double the size of that business in the coming years.\nLet's now look at the group's order book, which has increased slightly in the period to GBP 16.6 billion. U.K. construction has remained flat at GBP 6.1 billion and 83% of orders are now either on target cost or cost-plus contractual terms. In the U.S., within the GBP 5.6 billion order book, the buildings orders increased by 3% in the first half, and the order book is now weighted 79% towards buildings compared to 76% and at year-end.\nAs you know, the risk profile of civil's work in the U.S. is higher than that in buildings. And therefore, we continue to focus on a narrower scope of projects in civils that we believe can deliver attractive, sustainable returns. Gammon orders remained flat at GBP 2 billion and support services has increased by 4% following new power awards. Beyond the GBP 16.6 billion shown, we also track the projects which have been awarded to the group but have not yet gone to contract. Encouragingly, this figure has risen by 40% in the first half to around GBP 8 billion, driven by the addition of the Sky project in Power and a series of new awards in U.S. buildings.\nMoving on to the infrastructure investments. At the operating level, the business made a loss in the period due equally to 2 main factors. In the U.S., there's been a further increase in military housing costs relating to the monitors work. And in the U.K., a student accommodation project for which the group has been awarded preferred bidder status was canceled by the customer. As a result, we have written off the capitalized costs associated with the work on the project to date. It is worth noting that there are no other capitalized bidding costs on the group's balance sheet relating to projects which have not yet gone to contract.\nLooking to the second half, we expect profitability to improve and are forecasting a smaller loss for the full year prior to disposals.\nFinally, we continue to gain -- to expect gain on disposals for the full year in the range of GBP 20 million to GBP 30 million. The valuation of the investment portfolio increased by 5% in the first half of the year to GBP 1.3 billion, and I'll talk you through the bridge.\nWe invested GBP 12 million in new and existing projects, including the addition of a multifamily housing project in New Jersey. Cash distributions were GBP 16 million, which was lower than the prior year due in part to the additional costs in military housing, reducing distributions and the loss of yield from assets disposed of in 2023. The discount unwind increased our valuation by GBP 40 million and there was a GBP 60 million benefit from operational performance. This was largely due to an increase on U.S. military housing, where lower forecast insurance costs were partially offset by higher expected monitor loss.\nFinally, there was a small foreign exchange upside as sterling weakened against the U.S. dollar. Looking at cash now, which continues to be a good story for us and came out largely as expected for the first half.\nOperating cash flows were strong and were up 14% compared to the first half last year. Working capital reduced by GBP 76 million as forecast. This was due in part to the unwind of a spike in working capital, which we saw towards the end of 2023. Dividends from joint ventures was up GBP 5 million on the prior year. And I spoke to the equity we've invested on the previous slide. Pensions and leases were largely unchanged and capital expenditure reduced to GBP 12 million. As a reminder, the group doubled CapEx in 2023 to support our growth plans and had forecasted to return to a more normalized level in 2024.\nFinally, we bought back GBP 72 million of shares in the first half with share buybacks continuing to be an integral part of our consistent capital allocation framework which I'll speak to next.\nOur framework, which is now in its fourth year, remains unchanged. We prioritized investment into the business and have made 1 addition to the infrastructure investments portfolio in the first half. We remain on track to deliver our 2024 disposals program with our ongoing processes expected to complete in the coming months. Our cash remains strong and as covered upfront, our interim dividend has increased by 9%, and we're on track to complete the GBP 100 million share buyback scheme later this year. When combined dividends and share buybacks totaled GBP 160 million of shareholder returns in 2024.\nI'll finish with a reminder of our guidance for 2024, which remains unchanged at the group level since year-end. Following a strong first half, we expect PFO growth from the earnings-based businesses, gain on investment disposals for the year is expected to be in the range of GBP 20 million to GBP 30 million as we continue to realize value from the portfolio. Net finance income is expected around GBP 30 million and the effective tax rate will be close to statutory rates again.\nLooking at cash, we expect average net cash to remain close to the GBP 700 million posted last year and to include a working capital outflow and capital expenditure of around GBP 35 million.\nTo conclude, we continue to expect earnings growth in 2024, in line with market expectations and for growth to accelerate in 2025.\nI'll now hand you back to Leo.\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nRight. Now for the exciting bit. You've seen this many times before, but it's worth sort of repeating First and foremost, if you think about the business, we think of it in 2 parts. We've got our investment portfolio, and we've got what we call our earnings-based business. Our investment portfolio is actually valued at about GBP 1.3 billion. And as a company in our balance sheet, we carry about GBP 700 million net cash on average. If you add those 2 numbers together, you get to GBP 2 billion, which is approximately our market capitalization. And you get this for free. GBP 9 billion worth of turnover, turning over GBP 200 million profit today with only a positive outlook in terms of earnings growth going forward. Nice thing about this portfolio as well is just how it is diversified, you're into 3 different geographies, you're into multiple different business models. And of course, it's asset backed by cash and the investment portfolio. What could be better?\nSo let's look at some of the potential for the business. And in truth, the most interesting and compelling slide is this particular one. So if you're going to fall asleep, fall asleep after you've heard the messages associated with this. So -- and it's so important, I've actually written down all the points, so I'm going to stand at my podium and I'm going to actually say each 1 of them. Look, first -- I'm not actually to move. First and foremost, it is a large growth market. There's like GBP 60 billion going to be spent on the grid between now and 2030. And if you think that's interesting, when you get to 2030 and to 2035, it's going to be the Wild West, the amount of stuff that's going on is going to be mind boggling.\nThe second thing is, is that we are the largest provider of installing transmission cables in the air and under the ground and also pylons in the U.K. And that might sound particularly boring, but that's a lot of what work that has to be done. And without it, you can't connect all the connectors and the interconnectors and the offshore wind power and the nuclear power and the solar and the wind to the grid. So it's a real important enabler.\nCapacity is restricted by people and capability. There's a very interesting statistic National Grid published that they're going to deliver 5x the amount of transmission and cabling in the next 10 years. than they've delivered in the prior 30.\nNow what that actually says is that they've delivered very little in the last 30, which means that the people to do this work have not been trained up. We actually have over 50% of the workforce in the U.K. that does those things. So really exciting, we're in a very strong position. And by the way, the reason we are is we've invested in that business and those people over a long period of time. And I'll just draw your attention to this little thing here. We have a steel fabrication factory, which actually makes sections and sanctions for pylons. We approved an investment plan of about GBP 2.5 billion 2 years ago, and all of the CNC machines and the equipment have all been installed in order to actually meet the demand that we're now seeing. So it's very good that we're in the right place at the right time.\nThe other thing that's interesting about this is that realizing the demand that's out there is the tendering process, which is a 2-step tendering process is that we will go in early contractor involvement. We'll look at the scheme, we'll look at the engineering, we'll lay out the scheme. We'll cost it. We'll get a cost loaded schedule. So basically, what we're doing is we're derisking the whole program before we commit to deliver and commit to a cost. So in effect, versus our normal business, that's a massive risk reduction that will go on. What's also interesting is the demand is going to grow at such a level. But what it's doing is it's pulling through the resources from our other businesses. So for example, if we win GBP 1 billion worth of business, in the power area, 25% to 30% of that will actually be utilizing UKCS capability. And in light of that, there is an improved margin, but there was also a derisking of what U.K. CS does compared to what it would normally do. So that's actually earnings enhancing for us.\nAnd then finally, and most importantly, the funding of this comes through the meters and it actually gets applied to the bill. So it's not prone to the whims and vagaries of treasury in terms of canceling half of HS2 and things like that.\nSo really, really exciting. And if that wasn't enough for you, if I look at generation as opposed to transmission, if you look at nuclear, we're obviously very heavily involved in Hinkley and the marine works and also the mechanical and the electrical installation. But that then has a direct read across to Sizewell C where we've actually put the first shovels in the ground and the government has actually preloaded the job with about $1 billion of capital. So effectively, Sizewell C, even though it hasn't achieved FID, is actually started to do some of the early works in order to make sure we get the schedule.\nThere's also a debate as to whether or not it will actually go ahead. And there are real finding challenges, but the bottom line is around energy security is absolutely essential than it does go. We're also working on small modular reactors, I'm not personally convinced that there will be a big, big market in the U.K. for them. But at the end of the day, we're playing in that area, and we're working with Holtec who've got 1 of the first approved solutions. And then Fusion, which is actually a 40-year program for us is something we want to get involved with because it will tick over time, and it will become a big market 10 days -- 10 years from now.\nIn terms of wind, we don't actually do the wind mills, but we do look at the concrete basis, the floating and semisubmersible platforms. But more importantly, there's an awful lot of dock and port infrastructure that has to be enabled in order to make that possible. And it's the same in defense as well. So this pulls through what effectively is our civils capability.\nAnd then in the area of net 0 carbon or carbon capture, we've got Net Zero Tside. We're working with BP, Equinor, and we're actually on FEED study. So in all of these areas, we're effectively being paid for our early work involvement.\nAnd if I go back, this is real. It's happening today. It's driving revenue. We've got people working in Sky at the transmission here, Peter head and the transmission lines to [indiscernible] and South. We're looking at a lot of work here in the Suffolk area. So this is real business. If I look at this and start thinking 12, 24 months ahead, all of these are starting to come to fruition. So -- and if I look at fusion, you're looking at a 10-year pipeline. So there's a real heavy concentration of work that's actually building today and we'll achieve more momentum next year and the year after and then these other things come into play. So you just get a feel, there's just so much work out there that the industry doesn't have the capacity to deliver it. So our role is actually to sort of work out which orders we want to take and deliver and which ones that we actually reject, which is a nice place to be in because 5 years ago, you were actually at the other -- it was the other way around. We were looking to take orders regardless.\nIf I look at our defense business, we're really leveraging what I would describe as our nuclear know-how and capability. A lot of it learned at the likes of AWE, but also on Hinkley and the like. And we're really pleased the work at AWE is going well. That's the Atomic Weapons Energy establishment. It's going really well in terms of the hub that we're building. On the back of Hinkley and AWE, we are able to be selected as a construction partner for Rolls-Royce, which is working on the ARCUS program. And again, that's a GBP 500 billion worldwide program between Australia and the U.K. and the U.S. And again, it's something that we're actually really excited about, and we make a great partnership with Rolls-Royce. What's interesting here in the future is that our backlog in this area is about GBP 1.25 billion at the moment.\nIf you start looking at effectively the fiscal work that's going to a company the non-fissile stuff that we've won, that you can double that backlog and more. So there's an awful lot of business still to come. And we're in a great position in terms of having won the non-fissile work to actually win the fit out. So I'm really encouraged about the prospects in this market.\nAlso, again, I'd point you to the fact of ports and docks. We deal with nuclear we deal with submarines. And those submarines have to be docked in harbors and have to be maintained and refit it. There's a huge amount of infrastructure that has to be modified in order to cope with the next range of and fit out of submarines. So a lot of civil works going on here.\nIf I look at our other growth area in terms of U.S. construction, we're finding -- we're growing at about 3% in bookings at this moment in time. but our award has been not contracted. That's effectively worked that we have been told that we've won, but we actually haven't signed a contract on is up 50% year-on-year. And we have to be very, very careful that when interest rate starts to drop and these things start to mature into a contract that we can actually match the demand in the U.S. So we're seeing good progress there. Our growth initiatives in the U.S. around airports, prisons, schools, new geographies are all moving ahead very successfully at the moment. So again, I think that's underpinned by the level of increase in the awarded but not contracted. In the case of Hong Kong, Hong Kong is dominated at the moment by the airport, the T2 terminal and the automated people mover that's going ahead, and we're moving great volumes of revenue through on that. We're seeing great success in terms of the commercial, residential and commercial office market, where it's private investors. When it gets to what effectively our state-funded civil jobs we're seeing a bit of a slowdown because they've got the same budget problems that we see in the U.K. But all in all, we see steady progress in Hong Kong, and it's important to us.\nIf I look at our investment portfolio, I think it's important to look at the amount of activity that's going on under the surface here. If I look at the progress in the U.S. side, we bought 1 multifamily housing asset in the first half, just under 300 rooms. In terms of military housing, which you can see is the most important asset we have in the portfolio. We are looking at lease extensions in order to build circa 700 new houses on 3 of the bases that we run in terms of Carson Fort Lenenwood and Eisenhower, and that's actually a real vote of confidence in our capability by the Army, Navy and the Air Force. We're also looking at supporting the initiatives to actually get all of these military housing basis off-grid what they want to achieve is energy independence. So they're putting a lot of money into solar, into water, into performance contracting type projects, whereby they fund the energy reduction and that energy reduction that makes them to the point where they can get the actual base of grid altogether.\nIn the U.K., Urban Fox was an investment we made about 24 months ago in EV charging. And I'm sure you've all read the press. EV charging is an area where there's great hope for it, but the funding that's needed to make it work and the subsidy hasn't actually materialized. And as you see, that's actually affected electric car sales. We've had 1 success in terms of Dundee. But we're holding fast on this strategy because we think the government in terms of its Net Zero strategy, we'll actually release the funds and EV charging will roll out. If it does, it could be a very, very good business for us.\nReally pleasing to see what we've achieved in student accommodation in the U.K. On the back of the 1,400-bed E slope at Satish University, we finally closed the 1,900 bed West Lopes project. That's mobilized. It's mostly bought out at this moment in time, and it's proceeding at pace. So really great to see that 1 underway, and I'm very encouraged by that.\nAnd then finally, if you go back to the time when we had PPP and the like, we had a great capability to build design, build, finance and operate. And we funded part of the M25 through that. We're hoping that, that skill and capabilities can come back into play in the U.K., particularly around things like the lower terms crossing and the like. So an important business in our portfolio for us.\nSo in conclusion, where do we stand? As I said at the beginning, there's real momentum out there in the business at the moment. We're uniquely positioned in a rising tide of infrastructure spend. which the government needs in order to get the growth that they've actually promised. There is a restriction in terms of capability and demand does exceed supply under which circumstances prices and costs will rise, but also risk will actually reduce in terms of our jobs. I'm confident that the quality of our earnings will continue to increase. There will be cash backed and that will fund what effectively is our capital return to shareholders. But after we've ensured that we've got the capital needed by the business. To date, we've returned GBP 0.25 billion. It wouldn't surprise me by the end of next year if we actually made that number GBP 1 billion in total. So I think I'm very optimistic about the outlook for the future.\nAnd on that note, we'll hand over for Q&A.",

Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matthew Bilunas, our CFO.\nDuring the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\nI will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting Q1 sales results that are right in line with the expectations we shared in March, and profitability that was better than expected, demonstrating our strong operational execution. We are appropriately balancing the need to adjust in response to the current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to growth.\nIn this environment, customers are clearly feeling cautious and making trade-off decisions as they continue to deal with high inflation and low consumer confidence due to a number of factors. At the same time, in Q1, we saw our purchasing customer behavior remain relatively consistent in terms of demographics and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. In addition, our focus on being there for our customers with expertise and support was highlighted by material improvements in satisfaction scores for our in-home services and delivery and record scores in remote support, in-home repair, store care and Best Buy Total Tech call center experiences, all key differentiators for us. We remain as confident as ever about our strong position in the industry despite reporting lower sales than last year. In Q1, our comparable sales were down 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. From a merchandising perspective, similar to the past few quarters, the largest impact to our domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater and appliances. The promotional environment played out largely as expected. It was slightly more promotional than last year, and we believe we are now fully normalized to pre-pandemic levels from both the percent of products being promoted and the depth of promotions.\nIn some products and categories, the environment was more promotional than we had expected, and we saw promotional levels above fiscal '20. We effectively managed through those situations in partnership with our vendors. On a blended basis, our overall average selling price, or ASP, was slightly down to last year due to the return of promotionality. While we're on the topic, I would like to take a step back and address what we believe is a common misperception about our industry, that all products we sell are perpetually deflationary. In fact, most of our categories have had price stability over time or even see increases. The price of a product may come down in the year after it launches, only to be replaced by the next generation of the product launched at the same or slightly higher price. Innovation drives price stability and often drives consumers to adopt even higher ASP products based on new technology or additional features. For example, the 5-year compounded annual growth rate for average laptop prices is approximately 2%. For Best Buy specifically, we over-index in the newest innovation and next generation of products so we tend to carry a higher ASP than the overall industry. Additionally, as a reminder, structurally, our overall ASPs have also increased over the last several years due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs, as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points.\nNow back to our Q1 results. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 17% compared to last year as we lapped last year's elevated levels. The team continues to manage inventory tightly, targeting approximately [ 64 ] days of supply. We expect that our inventory levels will continue to normalize and year-over-year variances will more closely match our sales performance as we move through the year.\nIn the first quarter, digital sales comprised 31% of our domestic revenue, very similar to the last 2 years and twice as high as pre-pandemic. Our Buy Online, Pickup in Store percent of sales was also very consistent at just over 40%. Considering the speed of our delivery, with almost 60% of packages delivered within 2 days, we believe the consistency of our high in-store pickup by our customers really underscores the importance and convenience of our stores. I continue to be proud of our team's execution and ability to navigate through this challenging environment, always keeping our customers and their experience as our top priority.\nAs we look to the rest of the year, we expect the macro environment to continue to pressure demand in our industry this year. However, our guide for the year implies that we expect year-over-year comp performance to improve as we move through the year, and relapse the comparable sales declines we experienced last year. Based on what we can see right now, we continue to believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. Matt will provide more color on our expectations later in the call.\nThis year, we are focused on delivering great customer experiences, while running the business efficiently and strategically setting ourselves up to flourish when the industry returns to growth. This includes our efforts to expand our gross profit rate and to continue to prudently manage our SG&A expense?\nNow I'd like to update you on our membership program. The goal of membership is to drive increased customer engagement and increased share of wallet over time. As it relates to our paid membership program, our investment thesis remains very much intact. Our members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy and buying more across categories than nonmembers. Additionally, members rate our experience is higher. Our Net Promoter Scores from total tech members remain considerably higher than from nonmembers. No membership program is static, and we have always stated that it was our intent to iterate over time as we learned more. We've learned a tremendous amount from our members over the last couple of years, particularly that different customers value very different benefits when it comes to their technology.\nEarlier this month, we announced changes to our membership program that align all our memberships and will give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget and lifestyle. In addition, these changes will provide more flexibility and result in a lower cost to serve than our existing total tech program. Starting June 27, our membership program will offer 3 tiers: My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total. I'll spend a few minutes going a little deeper on each of the tiers.\nMy Best Buy will remain our free tier plan, built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account like online access to purchase history, order tracking and fast checkout. As you may recall, My Best Buy had historically been a points-based loyalty program. This past February, we added the free shipping benefit. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit cards. The customer and financial impacts we have seen thus far validate our decisions. For example, the online conversion rate for products under $35 has increased, and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the early financial impact has been better than we modeled. My Best Buy Plus is a new membership plan built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get everything included with the My Best Buy offering as well as exclusive prices and access to highly anticipated product releases. They also get free 2-day shipping and an extended 60-day return and exchange window on most products.\nMy Best Buy Total is a membership plan built for customers who want protection and support. This tier is an evolution of our current total tech offer and is $20 cheaper at $179.99 per year. It includes all the benefits from the Plus tier as well as Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote phone or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchase them. It also continues to include up to 2 years of product protection, including Apple Care Plus on most new Best Buy purchases. Instead of free in-home installation and Holloway services, members will receive promotional offers from time to time.\nAs we reflected on the goals of our membership programs, we made this change because we could see that many customers who became members primarily for free installation services did not stay with the program as long as other members and had significantly higher churn. From a financial perspective, we continue to expect our membership program to contribute approximately 25 basis points of enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion in fiscal '24.\nWe have already begun to deliver on this expectation as the changes we made to the free My Best Buy tier benefited our gross margin rate this quarter.\nNow I will shift topics to talk about our omnichannel operations. We are continuing to adapt our omnichannel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. For example, our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 store plans we announced this past March. These include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 experience store remodels and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. Consistent with the plans we shared entering the year and incorporated in our fiscal '24 guidance, during Q1, we advanced our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our business model and current trends.\nAs I mentioned on our last call, over the past 3 years, our overall headcount has declined by approximately 25,000 people, or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility. As a reminder, the vast majority of this headcount change came through the pandemic from attrition in our decisions not to backfill. Throughout these significant changes, we have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our employees, customers and shareholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. We also know that not all roles and the associated hourly pay are the same, and strategic trade-off decisions are necessary to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately, particularly customer-facing labor.\nBased on all these factors, we have been, as we've previously said, making multiple changes to our labor models. One such example is the recent change to our consultation program. By lowering the overall number of in-store consultants and designers, we were able to add approximately 2 million more hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year. Customers are already giving us higher marks for improved associate availability in recent customer surveys.\nIt's also important to note that we are moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to our stores and staffing to a market-based approach. And depending on the needs of each market, we're adding, removing, shifting or arranging the number of associates and roles needed to better and more efficiently serve those customers and to allow for more localized flexibility. Looking forward, we will continue to iterate our model to align with business trends, including initiatives such as membership and ensuring the span of control of our leaders is appropriate.\nAs you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels that also deliver efficiencies and better margins. I'd like to share a few examples around our customer care phone experience and our in-home sales team.\nOur customer care agents receive millions of customer phone calls every year. We recently launched a capability that uses generative AI to summarize the main points and follow-ups from each call. In the past, customer care agents manually took notes to capture interactions real time with customers. This new capability allows our agents to both fully focus on the customer during the call and reduces time between calls, lowering overall cost and improving agent satisfaction. In addition, this is providing us with valuable information about friction in our experiences, allowing us to continuously drive upstream improvements.\nIn another example, we're piloting a virtual reality training and simulation experience for our in-home consultants and designers. We expect this will decrease the cost to develop and certify in-home sales team, and elevate the specialized in-home selling skills of consultants and designers, especially those who are newer and less experienced. Additionally, these tools are always available for reference, whether a team member is in a customer's home or training in store.\nNow I will take a few moments to share our thoughts on our broader industry backdrop. As I mentioned, we expect that next year, the consumer electronics industry will see stabilization and possibly growth following 2 down years. I believe it's worth repeating why we are confident our industry will return to growth. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products in consumers' homes. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in just 2019. Second, we expect to begin to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought early in the pandemic. possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every 3 to 7 years depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle and home theater and large appliances toward the higher end of that range. We continue to see our lapsed customers returning at higher rates year-over-year, especially as customers we acquired early in the pandemic return for additional technology purchases. Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely some we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant over the long term, driving interest, upgrades and experiments. We can see the customer demand for newness exemplified in the last few weeks by the record-breaking launch of the new Zelda software for Nintendo Switch and the stronger-than-expected preorders for the new ASUS handheld gaming device.\nWe continue to believe the industry will get back to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation toward the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, generative AI and expansion of broadband access. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. We are also furthering our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging. We carry multiple EV charging brands, and we were the first retailer to carry Tesla chargers. We also launched Starlink satellite Internet kits on our digital channels and will have it available in stores later this summer. In addition, we are partnering with our vendors in new ways that leverage our capabilities to create new opportunities. For example, we are partnering with Roku to make TV advertising more relevant and performance-driven.\nThe first-ever TVs to be designed and made by Roku are available exclusively at our stores and on bestbuy.com, and brands will be able to work with us to target, optimize and measure their ads on Roku using Best Buy audience data. We also continue to build our Partner+ program that leverages our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities. We have several vendor partners, including Samsung, who are offering their online customers the option to conveniently pick up their products at their local Best Buy store. The recent launch of Aura Smart Rings is an example of how we partner with some of our smaller emerging vendors in a very comprehensive and unique way to drive customer engagement. Aura is a smart ring that uses sensors to track a variety of metrics to provide continuous health monitoring to improve the user's health habits. We launched the products exclusively on bestbuy.com and in 850 stores.\nWe have an interactive demo experience with the ability to try on the rings and order any configuration of style, color and size. We also incorporated the Best Buy store finder on Aura's website so customers can visit their closest store and see the products in person. I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation for all our associates across the company who continue to uniquely position us for the future through immense change. We continue to focus on providing competitive pay and benefits and leveraging flexible work models. And I'm pleased to report that we maintain industry load turnover rates, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally.\nIt's amazing to see so many of our key leaders choosing to build the future of retail with us. And I am proud of the many ways we were recognized during the quarter for our commitment to our people and the environment. We were included on Diversity Inc.'s 2023 list of Top 50 companies for diversity and ranked 17th on Diversity Inc.'s top companies for Board of Directors list, reflecting our ongoing work to ensure our leaders and our company reflect the communities we serve. Just last week, we were listed on Parity.org's list of best companies for women to advance as well as their inaugural best companies for people of color to advance. We were 1 of fewer than 20 companies named to both lists this year. We were also recently named 1 of Barron's 100 most sustainable U.S. companies for the sixth year in a row. In fact, this year, we were the top-ranked retailer.\nMy summary is consistent with my comments last quarter. We believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment, with a focus on our strategic initiatives and future. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our first quarter financials and fiscal '24 outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our first quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.5 billion declined 10.1% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% declined 120 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A was $40 million lower than last year and increased approximately 180 basis points as a percentage of revenue.\nPartially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 60-basis-point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.15 decreased 27%.\nWhile our revenue was down to last year, overall, our results, once again, align closely with our expectations entering the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to both higher gross profit rate and lower SG&A. The better-than-expected gross profit rate included favorable supply chain costs and benefits associated with changes made last year for our free My Best Buy membership offering. The favorable SG&A was driven by a combination of several smaller items with store payroll expense being the largest driver.\nNext, I will walk through the details on our first quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 11% to $8.8 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 10.4%. From a phasing perspective, February was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis with trends softening through the remainder of the quarter. From a category standpoint, the largest contributor to comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing, appliances, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in our gaming and service categories.\nIn our International segment, revenue decreased 11.6% to $666 million. This decrease was driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and a comparable sales decline of 5.5% in Canada. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 22.6%. The higher gross profit rate included the following: first, improvement from our membership offerings. This included a higher gross profit rate in our services category, which was primarily driven by the cumulative growth in total tech members. In addition, our rate benefited from the program changes we made last year to our free My Best Buy offering.\nSecond, product margin rates improved versus last year despite increased promotional activity. And third, the profit sharing revenue from our private label credit card arrangement was a benefit to our domestic gross profit rate. Overall, the results this quarter aligned with our commitment to improve our gross profit rate this year.\nOur International non-GAAP gross profit rate of 23.7% decreased 60 basis points compared to last year, which added approximately 10 basis points of pressure to our enterprise results on a [indiscernible] basis. The lower international gross profit rate was primarily driven by a lower mix of revenue from the higher-margin rate services category.\nBefore moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which we have now called out as a benefit to our gross profit rate for the last 8 quarters. In fiscal '23, the profit share was approximately 1.4% of domestic revenue, an increase of 50 basis points compared to fiscal '20. The growth was driven by the increased usage of our card both at and outside of Best Buy and a favorable credit environment. Our outlook for fiscal '24 assumes that profit share will have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on our gross profit rate for the remainder of the year.\nDomestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $29 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and depreciation.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a little more than $1 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 17% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During the quarter, we returned a total of $281 million to shareholders through dividends of $202 million and share repurchases of $79 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.92 was an increase of 5% and marked the tenth straight year of dividend increases.\nWe expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24. However, we are not providing a target. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress through the year.\nMoving next to capital expenditures, where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of approximately $80 million compared to last year with lower store-related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend.\nNow I would like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As a reminder, our original guide for this year assumes the consumer electronics industry would continue to feel the pressure of the broader macro environment and the high degree of uncertainty as it relates to the consumer. Our financial performance in the first quarter closely align with our expectations, and we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided this past March. Given the current environment, we are, of course, preparing for a number of scenarios within our guidance range. At this point, we believe our sales align closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. It is still early in the year so we will continue to watch the trends closely and adjust as necessary.\nLet me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions. Starting with revenue, we expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 million to $45.2 billion and Enterprise comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect the 53rd week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, and it is excluded from our comparable sales. Our guide implies comparable sales trends versus last year improve as we progress through the year. Let me share context on that.\nStarting in Q1 of last year, our industry experienced the beginnings of macro pressure and the broader implications of normalizing consumer demand trends after 2 years of higher growth. This resulted in a 10% comparable sales decline for the full year. For the remainder of this year, we will continue to lap the industry pressure that only worsened from the first quarter of last year. Furthermore, when using fiscal '20 as a comparison, you will see that our guidance implies revenue trends will further soften in the second quarter. After removing the estimated revenue from the 53rd week, the midpoint of our revenue guidance reflects a scenario where our growth, compared to fiscal '20, is slightly negative in the second quarter and regresses slightly more in the second half of this year.\nThis is clearly a continued slowdown in revenue growth compared to fiscal '20. For reference, our revenue growth compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20 peaked at 27% in Q1 of fiscal '22 and generally has been slowing ever since, the last quarter at 4%.\nMoving on to full year profitability guidance, which is, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and for interest income to exceed interest expense this year.\nAs it relates to the extra week, we expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. I will review the full year gross profit rate and SG&A working assumptions that we shared this past March. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives. We expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment and our omnichannel operations. We also expect our membership program and our health initiative to improve our gross profit rate. Lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs and the profit sharing from our private label credit card, we have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year.\nNow moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year, and the high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23.\nDepreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million and store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect that comparable sales will decline in the range of 6% to 8%, which reflects a sequential year-over-year improvement compared to the first quarter. Our revenue growth trends during the first 3 weeks of the quarter improved from April and were within our Q2 guidance range.\nOn the profitability side, we anticipate our second quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3% or slightly higher.\nLastly, we expect SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year, at the midpoint of our revenue range. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.",

My name is Francois, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I will now hand you over to your host, Mollie O'Brien, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVP of IR, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO.

Today, we are reporting Q4 sales results in line with our expectations and better-than-expected profitability. We knew customers would be looking for joy during the holiday but would also be seeking great value given the pressures of inflation. Consumers responded to our compelling deals, and as we predicted, their shopping patterns were more similar to historical holiday periods than what we saw the last 2 years. Specifically, customer shopping activity was more concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last 2 weeks of December than last year. Customers continue to choose us for the expertise, service and overall value we provide across all channels. Our customer satisfaction scores indicate that our talented teams and omnichannel capabilities delivered better experiences during the critical holiday period this year compared to both last year and the prepandemic fourth quarter of fiscal '20, especially within our services and delivery experiences.\nThroughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance. Each and every day, our management team and employees across the company are making tough trade-off decisions. Our Q4 comparable sales were down 9.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8% was higher than expected. The promotional environment in the fourth quarter was more intense than last year. However, the related financial pressure was less than expected and contributed to a stronger gross profit rate performance.\nAs a reminder, we first began to see promotional activity return in the back half of calendar 2021. Since then, it has proliferated across categories, and we would characterize the promotional environment for consumer electronics as essentially normalized back to prepandemic 2019 at this point.\nWe continue to manage our inventory very effectively and are focused on maintaining targeted weeks of supply that we believe are appropriate for the current business trends. Our inventory at the end of Q4 was down 14% from the fourth quarter of last year and is essentially in line with our sales trajectory versus prepandemic fiscal '20. From a merchandising perspective, the largest impacts to our domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, appliances and mobile phones, partially offset by growth in gaming and tablets.\nOur organics were similar to last quarter with our blended average selling price, or ASP, down low single digits on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we start the year until we lap the full return of promotional activity that occurred in the second half of last year. Compared to fiscal '20, ASPs continue to be quite a bit higher, and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. As we've shared previously, this is due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points.\nI am proud of our team's execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers, while also managing the business for future growth, during what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry.\nAs we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued volatility, and we are preparing for another down year for the CE industry. We are expecting the most comparable sales pressure in the first quarter as year-over-year compares ease through the year. Based on what we can see right now, we believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. There are several factors driving the expected return of industry growth, which could occur next year depending on the macro environment. First, we continue to see evidence that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products and consumers' health. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in 2019. And consumers indicate that more of their tech purchases are need-based than want based.\nFor example, in our recent surveys, the majority of consumers indicated that most tech purchases are for functional reasons versus emotional ones. Second, we will start to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech [bot] early when the pandemic kick in, possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every 3 to 7 years depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle and home theater and large appliances towards the higher end of that range.\nThird, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely sum we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant, driving interest, upgrades and experimentation. That innovation has largely been paused since the pandemic began and the focus shifted to production. And we believe there will be a desire from our vendor partners to stimulate those replacement cycles or build completely new categories going forward.\nAdditionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time. For example, cloud and augmented reality will increasingly lead to new capabilities and customer experiences. The cloud solves significant customer pain points by making it much easier and faster to transfer your data and existing device preferences to the next generation of product, which creates customer interest in upgrading more frequently.\nIn the augmented reality space, we believe significant developments are coming that will generate dramatic change in many products over time. Also, the recent government infrastructure funding allocated to expand broadband Internet access to more Americans provides additional support for these macro trends and incremental access to broadband is proven to help fuel tech demand. And as we noted, since the beginning of the pandemic, the vendor community has been more focused on making product rather than refreshing product. And we believe the industry will get back to more of a normalized pace of meaningful innovation towards the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024.\nSpecific innovation we expect to see this year in our larger product categories include dual-screen and foldable laptops in computing and personalization in large appliances. In home theater, beyond traditional panel innovation, we're seeing more of a lifestyle type approach to innovation. For example, there's growing popularity of new high-performance audio and video products, including TVs, projectors and speakers that more seamlessly blend into a room versus older technology that takes up a substantially larger physical footprint in the home.\nWhile all our product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging. We are the CE experts and the best place for customers to see existing and new tech and get advice and support.\nIn our August 2020 earnings call, during the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts the customer entirely in control to shop how they want. And our strategy was to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. With that as a backdrop, we are building out our suite of unique assets that deliver customer experiences no one else can, and that we believe makes us the compelling retailer of the future.\nAs we do this, we are carefully balancing our short- and long-term initiatives given the volatile environment. There are 5 main areas we are strategically focused on. We will not dive deeply into all of them today: one, evolving our omnichannel retail model; two, building customer relationships through membership; three, incubating and growing Best Buy Health; four, removing costs and improving efficiency and effectiveness; and five, unlocking reverse secondary market opportunities.\nI will now provide more detail on the evolution of our omnichannel retail map. In fiscal '23, digital sales comprised 33% of our domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. Sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained significantly higher. Even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation. Not only it's 67% of our domestic revenue transacted in our stores, more than half of our identified customers engage in cross-channel shopping experiences.\nAnd of course, more than 40% of online sales are picked up in stores. Further, we play an incredibly important role for our vendors as the only national CE specialty retailer who can showcase their products and help commercialize their new technology. We were already a leading omnichannel retailer heading into the pandemic. However, we knew that in order to stay relevant in an increasingly digital age, we needed to evolve our omnichannel retail model strategy. And within that, our portfolio of stores needed to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment.\nWe also needed them to become more cost efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. Over the past 3 years, we have been optimizing our store staffing model to reflect the changes in customer shopping behavior and to fuel investments in higher wages. We have also been rapidly testing different store formats and operating models.\nDuring those 3 years, we closed approximately 70 large format stores, or 7%, including 17 closing this week through our normal stringent lease review process. At the same time, we opened 4 new stores, including new smaller store formats and relocated 6 stores. In addition, we completed 44 remodels to our 35,000 square foot experienced store format. Finally, we boosted our technology development and our digital tools, including our app, to drive customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and increased efficiency in our stores.\nNow I would like to provide our high-level plans to refresh our U.S. store portfolio over the long term. We will continue to close an average of 15 to 20 traditional large-format stores per year through our normal lease review process. We will also continue to scale our experienced store remodels. As we have shared previously, this format has more premium experiences in a 35,000-square-foot selling area, showcasing the very best of Best Buy.\nWe will decrease the selling square footage and adjust the assortment and merchandising strategy in many of our stores. The shift to digital sales and the resulting lower in-store revenue, in addition to a much larger percent of high ASP appliances sales, has pressured our operating model and working capital. For context, roughly 80% of the SKUs we display on our sales floor sell one or fewer per week. In these core medium-sized stores, some of the selling square footage will be shifted into larger backrooms. So the total square footage of these stores is not expected to change materially. Our stores have multiple purposes now, and a larger backroom provides better support for other capabilities like our high rate of in-store pickup of online orders.\nIn addition, we see significant opportunity to leverage these larger store warehouses and our supply chain expertise to help our vendor community fulfill a larger portion of their direct-to-consumer channel. In addition, we will open more outlet stores that support our value-focused customers. These stores are driving a higher mix of new and reengaged customers in addition to a better financial recovery on open box and return product.\nOver time, we believe we can also leverage these outlet locations to help our vendor community with their own open box and refurbished goods that are coming from other channels. As it relates to our small format pilots that focus on tech Essentials, we will continue to monitor them to determine the go-forward plan. We believe there is an opportunity for these to be growth vehicles in underserved urban neighborhoods as well as small remote markets. We're utilizing a market-based approach to evolve our stores. This means we're moving away from a one-size-fits-all model to a portfolio comprised of store formats and fulfillment solutions appropriately sized and working together to efficiently serve our market.\nFrom a timing perspective, as you would expect, we're going to phase these changes in line with how the business evolves. We view our store portfolio evolution as a long-range rolling plan, continually making adjustments each year with a sustainable annual investment over time. For fiscal '24 specifically, our plans include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 experienced store remodels and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. In addition, we plan to complete 2 remodels of our medium core format.\nWe expect to incur approximately $200 million in capital expenditures for both these physical store changes and routine store resets and maintenance. This is down approximately $100 million from last year. Of course, at the same time, we will continue to evolve our operating model to match the lower selling square footage and the ongoing evolution of our business model. Over the past 3 years, our overall head count has declined by approximately 25,000 people, or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility.\nOur most recent restructuring activities will allow us to invest more in our customer-facing labor and at the same time, drive increased ability to flex labor spend with revenue fluctuations. Stepping back, we expect the evolution of our store portfolio and operating model to drive sales lift and efficiencies over time. Most importantly, these changes are necessary to relieve the pressures of a changing world, a world in which customers are in control and increasingly more digital and the cost to operate physical stores such as rent and labor are not likely going to come down.\nNow I'd like to talk about membership and its role in driving deeper relationships with our customers. As we said last quarter, in fiscal 2024, we will continue to iterate our programs based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. I'll start with an update on our entry tier of membership are my Best Buy program. For context, we have approximately 100 million members, with 40 million to 45 million members active per year.\nMy Best Buy has long been a points-based loyalty program. The efficacy of points programs has been declining over time as we analyze the data and talk to our customers, we found free shipping resonated even more than 1% back on their purchases. As a result, earlier this year, we added free shipping for all purchases with no minimum purchase. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit cards.\nOur credit card members will continue to earn 5% back in rewards on their purchases at Best Buy in addition to flexible financing options. Thus far, feedback indicates that the changes are resonating with our customers. Moving on to TotalTech, our comprehensive paid membership that includes 24/7 technical support, product protection for all your tech products, special member pricing and much more. We launched it, knowing it was a bold new membership program, unlike anything else in the retail industry.\nOur investment thesis remains very much intact. Members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy and buying more cross-category than nonmembers. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our Net Promoter Scores from TotalTech members remain considerably higher than nonmembers. Like we did with My Best Buy, we have been studying these customers closely in the first year of the program to really understand what drives not just acquisition, but engagement with us.\nWe're going to use that data to evolve our membership proposition. For example, we will tailor the offer with the intention of retaining customers at increasingly higher levels, and, at the same time, explore a tiered approach that may resonate with an even bigger population of customers.\nWe mentioned on our November call that we plan to iterate in ways that reduce the cost to serve, and we're leveraging member usage and retention data to do so. We've made 2 small changes already with more planned this year. These 2 changes were adding back restocking fees for certain product returns and removing free same-day delivery as a benefit.\nFrom a financial perspective, we lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact late in Q3, and the program had a neutral year-over-year impact on Q4. We expect membership to contribute to operating income rate expansion from here as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In fiscal '24 specifically, we expect our membership program changes, including My Best Buy changes, to drive approximately 25 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion, which will primarily be in the back half of the year. We expect to share more details on the coming plan changes on our May call.\nTransitioning to Best Buy Health. The role of technology within healthcare is becoming more important than ever, and our strategy is to enable care at home for everyone. In fiscal '24, we expect to grow Best Buy Health sales faster than the base business. We also expect to drive a higher mix of our more profitable and unique service plans and deliver cost optimization in our active aging business.\nWe expect these initiatives to drive approximately 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion. I want to spend a few minutes on our Care at Home solution that leverages current health, our leading technology platform that brings together remote patient monitoring, telehealth, a full support model and patient engagement into a single solution for health care providers and pharmaceutical companies.\nBoosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking year ever last year, and we now have relationships with 5 of the top 10 largest health systems in the U.S. These names include Geisinger, Mount Sinai Health System, NYU Langone Health and others. 40% of our provider clients launched in Q4, demonstrating our momentum.\nWe also just began a 3-year development partnership with Advocate Health. This partnership will leverage Advocate Health's nationally leading hospital-at-home-program, providing care to a population of over 6 million people and Best Buy's technology expertise. Together, we will develop enhanced capabilities and better patient experiences for both Advocate Health and other health systems around the [company.] We are excited about the momentum of Care at Home, but it is still a nascent emerging part of the healthcare industry.\nWe are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and leveraging Best Buy's core assets, including the Geek Squad to incubate a new business. The revenue contribution is currently very small and will take time to ramp as the Care at Home space matures and expands over the coming years.\nBefore turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and communities we serve. We know our employees and the expert service they provide are our core competitive differentiator, and we are maniacally focused on driving positive employee experience and engagement. Of course, the competitive compensation continues to be table stakes, and we've increased our store associate hourly pay approximately 25% in the last 3 years.\nAdditionally, external research supports our belief that employees are increasingly prioritizing human factors of their jobs, including well-being, work life balance, career development and culture, our unique way of managing our portfolio of employee benefits coupled with the intentional approach to provide ladder and lattice career movement at all levels helps counteract the market pressures of rising wage rates in retail. We serve customers in a multitude of ways, in store, in home and virtually, providing many opportunities for employees to upskill and reskill and ultimately choose the path that's right for them at Best Buy.\n60% of our general managers started at Best Buy in non-leadership role, and 94% of our general managers and assistant managers here today were hired internally. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry.\nFrom a community standpoint, we finished the year with 52 Best Buy team tech centers and are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of 100. These centers continue to provide young people in our communities with the access, inspiration and opportunity they deserve to help them define their futures. I am proud to say that Best Buy continues to be recognized for the many ways we are supporting our employees and communities. In Q4, we ranked 34th and were the #1 retailer on the Just Capital list that evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. in part on how a company invests in its workers, supports its communities and minimizes environmental impact.\nIn summary, we believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with focus on our strategic initiatives.\nThe structural hypothesis we laid out in our investor update last year remains true. There are more technology products than ever in people's home. Technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we uniquely are there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space. We are in this for the long term and believe our purpose to enrich lives through technology is only more relevant in the future.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter financials and fiscal '24 outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our fourth quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $14.7 billion, declined 9.3% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8%, declined 30 basis points compared to last year, which is an improvement from previous trends as this was the first full quarter of lapping the rollout of our TotalTech membership offering. Non-GAAP SG&A was $241 million lower than last year and increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61, decreased 4%. The year-over-year decline in our earnings per share was driven by the lower operating income dollars I just mentioned, which were partially offset by a $0.19 per share benefit from a lower share count, a $0.06 per share benefit from higher interest income and a $0.05 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate.\nWhile our sales results were down to last year, overall, they aligned very closely with our expectations entering the quarter, including our assumptions on the monthly phasing and the mix of revenue by channel. Our non-GAAP operating income performance exceeded our expectations due to the higher gross profit rate, which included slightly less pressure from promotions than we had expected.\nNext, I will walk through the details on our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 9.8% to $13.5 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.6%. Online revenue of 38% of our total domestic revenue, which was 12th consecutive quarter that our online sales mix was above 30%.\nAs expected, December comparable sales decline of approximately 8% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis. When comparing to the prepandemic fiscal '20 comparable period, January was our best performing month and the only fiscal month that had positive growth. Our domestic gross profit rate declined 20 basis points, primarily due to lower product margin rates, which were partially offset by favorable service margin rates and the higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement.\nThe improved service margin rate included a favorable $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $224 million on lower store payroll cost, reduced incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $90 million this quarter and $455 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense was once again favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales.\nNext, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of ongoing changes in our business trends, earlier in fiscal '23, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $86 million of such restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and $147 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. Since we started our Renew Blue transformation 10 years ago, we have been committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set in 2019 was to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25.\nDuring fiscal '23, we reached our $1 billion target. These efforts highlight how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Savings from these initiatives are being used to help offset higher labor costs, depreciation and the add-back of incentive compensation.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash. As Corie mentioned, our year-end inventory balance was approximately 14% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During fiscal '23, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. This morning, we announced that we are increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share, which is a 5% increase. This increase represents the tenth straight year of raising our regular quarterly dividend. After pausing share repurchases earlier this year, we resumed in November and ended the year with $1 billion in repurchases.\nDuring fiscal '23, our total capital expenditures were $930 million versus $737 million in the prior year, mainly due to increased store-related investments. Looking to fiscal '24, as Corie discussed, store-related investments are planned to decrease approximately $100 million compared to fiscal '23.\nLet me next share more color on our outlook for fiscal '24, starting with the 53rd week that will occur in the fourth quarter. We expect the extra week in fiscal '24 to add approximately $700 million in revenue and provide a benefit to our full year non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 10 basis points. The higher operating income rate is primarily driven by the added leverage on SG&A for items such as occupancy and depreciation, which are not impacted by the extra week. As a reminder, the revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales.\nMoving on to our full year fiscal '24 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion, Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to down 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $850 million. We expect to repurchase shares during fiscal '24, however, we are not providing a target today. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress throughout the year.\nLastly, we expect interest income to exceed interest expense this year.\nNext, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance, starting with our top line outlook. As we enter the new fiscal year, the consumer electronics industry continues to feel the effects of a broader macro environment. At the high end of our guidance range, we expect comparable sales to be approximately flat as we exit the year. The low end of our guide reflects a scenario where the consumer spending regresses even further from our current levels and lasts longer into the year.\nMoving next to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating income rate is expected to decline next year due to the SG&A leverage on expected sales decline. We are expecting to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives.\nFirst, as Corie discussed, the planned changes to our membership offerings are expected to improve our gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points. Second, we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment and our omnichannel operations. Third, continued growth in Best Buy Health is also expected to contribute to gross profit rate expansion. Lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year.\nNow moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to fiscal '23. As we have shared in prior quarters, we expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million. Store payroll expense, which includes continued investments in store wages, is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales.\nLastly, as you would expect, our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends.\nBefore I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 10%, which is similar to our revenue trends during the first 4 weeks of the quarter. We expect our operating income rate to decline at the lower -- as the lower revenue delevers on SG&A dollars that are similar to last year. We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, with the expansion slightly below the full year outlook I just shared.\nI will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.",

My name is Laura, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand you over to your host, Mollie O'Brien, to begin today's conference. Thank you.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVP of IR, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.\nPlease refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nCEO & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team's execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers during what is clearly a challenged environment for our industry. Customers have high expectations regarding service, and we were pleased to see NPS improvements across many areas of our business as we continue to focus on creating differentiated experiences that customers will love into the future.\nToday, we are reporting Q3 financial results that are ahead of our expectations. Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term growth. Our comparable sales were down 10.4% on a year-over-year basis. This represents 8% revenue growth over the third quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal '20, which was consistent with the growth compared to fiscal '20 that we saw last quarter.\nAs expected, our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year due to the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics, the investments in our growth initiatives and SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was up 22% versus pre-pandemic fiscal '20. We continue to manage our inventory effectively. Our inventory at the end of Q3 was down almost 15% from the third quarter of last year. This is more than our Q3 sales decline and projected Q4 sales due to a few factors. First, from a timing perspective, some receipts came in a few days later than expected and arrived just after the quarter closed.\nAdditionally, due to supply constraints last year, we focused on bringing inventory in earlier to secure it for holiday. So October of last year ended with an unusually high level of inventory. For additional context, this year's $600 million in receipts moved from October into the first 2 weeks of November. This shift equates to about 8% of our inventory.\nThe promotional environment continues to be considerably more intense than last year. Like Q2, the level of promotionality in Q3 was similar to pre-pandemic levels and in some areas was even more promotional as the industry works through excess inventory in the channel as well as response to softer customer demand.\nFrom a merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories. Consistent with the first half of the year, the largest impact to our enterprise comparable sales came from computing and home theater. Compared to Q3 of fiscal '20, our computing revenue remains 23% higher and our appliances revenue remains 37% higher. Our blended average selling price, or ASP, in Q3 was down slightly on a year-over-year basis.\nASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as promotional activity that was largely absent during much of the pandemic has returned. Compared to fiscal '20 ASPs continue to be higher, and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. This is due to 2 factors that have been driving ASPs higher for years and accelerated during the pandemic.\nFirst, category mix. We have driven material growth and mixed more into products like large appliances and large TVs, which carry high ASPs. Second, within categories, customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. I would like to pause here for a moment and talk about what we are seeing as it relates to consumer behavior.\nAs I step back at the highest macro level across retail, each customer is making trade-offs, especially with the significant impact of inflation on the basics like food, fuel and lodging. This disproportionately impacts lower-income consumers as a much larger proportion of their spend is on those basics. Across consumers, we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up. And value clearly matters to everyone.\nDuring Q3, we continue to see more interest in sales events geared at exceptional value. As a result, there is no one way to describe all customers, and we have repeatedly referred to the impacts of the current macro environment on consumers as uneven and unsettled. As it relates to our results as a specialty CE retailer, we saw relatively consistent behavior from our purchasing customers in Q3.\nOur demographic mix is basically steady versus last year and pre-pandemic. Our blended mix of premium product is higher, both units and dollars than last year and pre-pandemic. Within some specific categories, we can see some cohorts of customers trading down but it is not aggregating into an overall impact.\nWhile sales are down in our signature categories as we lap the strong growth of the pandemic years, our initiative to expand our presence in adjacent categories is driving sales growth. While still small overall, we are driving sales growth in e-bikes and outdoor living categories as we expand to more stores in addition to our online assortment. Outdoor furniture, in particular, is demonstrating strong growth driven by new showrooms for our Yardbird assortment, including in our Best Buy stores and new stand-alone showrooms.\nFrom health and wellness perspective, we launched over-the-counter hearing aids last month in almost 300 stores and online, including a new online hearing assessment tool. Volume is still relatively low, but the Q3 sales growth rate exceeded our expectations and demonstrates that customers see Best Buy as a relevant provider of these products.\nAs you have all likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun, and now more than ever, our customer are looking to bring joy back into their holiday celebration. Like we said in our last earnings call, we expect shopping patterns will look more similar to historical holiday periods than what we have seen in the last 2 years. Specifically, we expect there will be more customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday, and the 2 weeks leading up to December 25.\nOur results so far in October and the first 2 weeks of November have come in largely as expected and support this view thus far. From an inventory perspective, we have approached holiday strategically, placing bets in areas that require a longer lead time and taking a more flexible approach in other areas.\nWe believe this gives us more room to invest and partner with vendors so changes in demand provide additional sales opportunities. I would also stress that while November typically represents the largest influx of inventory in Q4, we will continue to receive inventory every week throughout the holiday season to replenish inventory levels. While aligning inventory levels with uncertain and evolving customer demand is always challenging, we are well positioned and feel confident we will be able to react quickly to changes we may see in customer demand.\nFrom a labor standpoint, we have seen a strong pool of applicants for seasonal associates to supplement our store team. This, combined with our investments in wages over the past few years and comparably low turnover that remains close to pre-pandemic levels, means we are ready to provide our customers the great service they expect to find in our stores.\nWe are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all our customers, including special promotions available to Totaltech and My Best Buy members. We have curated gift list with inspiration for all from family members to foodies and content creators to gamers. For [additives] of shopping and peace of mind, we have extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season.\nWe're also offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items in addition to our convenient store and curbside pickup options. We feel confident heading into what could be an uneven holiday season, and we have tailored our offerings to delight our customers whatever their budget.\nStrategically, as we look ahead, we are positioning ourselves to lead the way in the future of retailing. This is a future where the customer is in control and expect seamless experiences across all touch points. It is becoming more evident every quarter that the pandemic-induced shopping behavior changes are sticky and that our digital penetration of domestic sales will likely remain above 30%.\nFor the first 9 months of the year, our online sales as a percentage of domestic revenue were 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. We expect that penetration rate to begin to increase again over time as it did pre-pandemic. Additionally, customer demand for other virtual interactions has remained elevated, and we have seen strong and sustained sales growth from out investments in chat, phone and video sales experiences this year.\nOf course, that also means that almost 70% of customers are shopping in our stores and customers representing 42% of our online sales pick up their products at our stores. As such, it is imperative we continue to invest in our stores and elevate our unique experiences. One way we are doing that is with our 35,000 square foot experience store remodel. We remain excited about these as we continue to see positive results from our longer running Houston and Charlotte remodels, including stronger sales, increased customer penetration and higher Net Promoter Scores.\nThese stores highlight broader assortment, including the opportunity to showcase the new categories I referenced earlier and really bring them to life. The remodels also include premium home theater and premium appliances, more space for consultations and services and expanded fulfillment capabilities like larger warehouses, in-store and curbside pickup and 24/7 lockers.\nAdditionally, as you would expect, they all include the very best, most up-to-date vendor experiences, showcasing premium merchandising and specialized labor. While market conditions have created a tough environment for delivering remodels, our incredible and dedicated team was able to deliver 42 of them by Black Friday.\nWe plan to provide a broader update on our store portfolio refresh strategy at year-end. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost-effective ways. For example, we have introduced a new app for our associates called Solution Sidekick that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and location.\nWith the app, associates interacting with the customer can see the customers' profile in the moment, including historical purchases and active memberships. As the associate starts an order with product recommendations, the app automatically calculates total tax savings for existing and prospective members and recommends additional product solution.\nImportantly, if a customer isn't ready to buy in the moment, associates can send the product recommendations and a recap of the conversation to the customer via e-mail, text or QR code so they can purchase later at their convenience. It is early, but we are very encouraged by the ramping employee adoption of the app and the higher revenue per transaction we are seeing when associates leverage Solution Sidekick.\nWe are also leveraging our investment in electronic sign labels to provide a better and more efficient experience for customers who want to buy a product that is locked up or not readily available on the shelf. We've added new functionality that allows a customer to scan the QR code with their phone's camera and push a button notifying they are ready to purchase. This sends the store associate an instant and prioritized notification to pick the product and have it ready at pickup.\nWe also took a much more digital approach when building out the experience for our 5,000 square foot store pilot we opened in Charlotte over this summer, highly leveraging these digital tools. Similar to the U.S., we are evolving our model in Canada as well and continue to see better-than-expected financial results there. We have been piloting initiatives there, including technology subscription, online marketplace, a market-focused test and small store formats.\nThis expands our testing and innovation capabilities and provides opportunities to learn from their experiences when they are able to iterate faster and are further along in their pilots. We are excited to be able to innovate and leverage learnings on both sides of the border.\nTurning to membership, our Best Buy Totaltech offering is a very important initiative to drive deeper relationships with our customers. Last month, we passed the 1-year anniversary of our national launch, and we are pleased to report that Totaltech is driving the member behavior we envision. Members are engaging more frequently with us and shifting their share of wallet to Best Buy.\nAdditionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our Net Promoter Score from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than nonmembers. Nearly half of the new members joined in the program in the past year were either new or lapsed customers, reinforcing that the value of Totaltech resonates beyond our existing loyal customers. Very early retention data shows renewal rates running largely in line with our original expectations.\nTotaltech is a comprehensive membership with wide appeal across demographics. For example, younger generations and those with children utilize more of our newer warranty and member pricing benefits, and older generations utilize more of our enhanced services and support benefit. Our associates continue to love the program since it clearly provides value to every single customer and simplifies the sales interaction.\nWhile we are encouraged by the results in the first full year, we will continue to iterate based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. As we said last quarter, we have been encouraged with the pace at which we have been acquiring new customers, considering the uniqueness of the offer, the macro environment and the decline in our product sales.\nNevertheless, these factors have resulted in a lower member count than our original expectations. Last quarter, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members. And the early results continue to be positive. We are also activating on ways to continue to improve acquisition through our digital channel.\nFrom an optimization perspective, we will evolve the program in ways that also reduce our cost to serve. We have now lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact and anticipate the program to have a neutral impact on Q4 from a year-over-year perspective. Over time, we expect the program to contribute to operating income rate expansion as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering.\nIn the current economic environment, many consumers are facing increasing financial constraints. We believe we are well positioned to meet customers' needs in this environment. In addition to creating key promotional moments, offering competitive prices, repairing and supporting existing products and scaling our Best Buy outlets, we offer multiple financing options to improve affordability. These include our co-branded Citibank credit card, lease-to-own program, buy now pay later option and most recently, our exclusive Upgrade+ program for Apple MacBooks. Upgrade+ powered by Citizens Pay is a brand-new program that allows customers to acquire Mac laptops and related accessories for a low monthly fee.\nAfter 3 years, they can easily turn in their old laptop and upgrade to the latest tech while they continue paying a low monthly fee. We can then refurbish this old laptop and offer it to a new customer through our outlet stores or digital platforms. This partnership with Apple is a great example of how we work with our vendors in unique ways to commercialize and showcase their technology innovation while also offering unique value and confidence to our customers.\nIn a different example of a unique vendor partnership, we have started a pilot in the homebuilder space through a collaboration with Whirlpool and one of the top homebuilders in the U.S. to provide and install everything from connected doorbells and thermostats to large appliances. Though early, we've delivered 5 of the roughly 45 markets for the homebuilder, which is giving us great insight for how we may be able to expand the pilot.\nBased on what we've learned, we see this model as an opportunity to partner with numerous other homebuilders to provide them similar or expanded solutions based on our capability. Before closing and turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and the communities we serve.\nThe Best Buy Foundation's Teen Tech Centers are providing access, inspiration and opportunity for young people in the communities that need it most. We continue to expand the program with 52 Teen Tech Centers open across the country, including opening our ninth Teen Tech Center in the Twin Cities, our hometown.\nWe also remain committed to creating an environment where all employees feel engaged and have access to specialized benefits and resources. We're proud to have women leaders at the highest levels of our company and believe it reflects our commitment to support our employees and their [loved ones]. This year, we are honored to rank #15 on Forbes 2022 list of the world's top female-friendly company, which recognizes companies that support women professionally and personally.\nSimilarly, we were honored to be named as 1 of Forbes 2022 America's Best Employers for veterans, our first time on that list. In summary, I am proud of our nimble execution this quarter and this year. Our teams have been navigating well through an incredibly dynamic environment, and I want to thank them for their ingenuity, drive and commitment to our customers.\nThere is, of course, ongoing macro uncertainty. And as we head through the holiday and into next year, we believe it will continue to be an uneven backdrop. Indicators remain unusually varied. The job market remains strong, consumer spending continues, and inflation appears to be slowing a bit, but savings are starting to erode. Consumer confidence is low. The housing market is cooling and inflation remains a particular concern on the basics like food, fuel and lodging, all of which have a profound and sustained impact.\nAs you would expect, we are planning for multiple scenarios given the very unsettled and uneven consumer response to these varied indicators. We are adjusting our cost structure as we respond to current and potential future conditions. We are also making strategic decisions and trade-offs to continue to advance our initiatives. We are doubling down on our ability to lead the future of omnichannel retail and capitalize on opportunities as the industry moves through this downturn and eventually returns to growth again.\nWe are as confident and excited about our future as ever. Technology demand over the past few years has resulted in a larger install base, and customers will want and need to replace and upgrade their tech devices, particularly as we near the 3-year mark since the start of the pandemic. At the same time, our technology vendor partners will continue to innovate and drive excitement and demand. We are the leading technology solutions provider for the home, a home increasingly dependent on all this technology working together and evolving over time.\nWe are uniquely positioned to inspire and help customers with all aspects of their technology from deciding what to purchase, to installing it and getting the most out of it, all the way to helping when it's not working. We leverage our specialized Geek Squad agents, our expert sales associates and consultants, experienced merchants and sophisticated supply chain to deliver experiences no one else can in customers' homes, virtually, digitally and in our stores.\nI will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Hopefully, you're able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Before I get into the details specific to our third quarter, I would like to step back and provide some context on how our financials have evolved since the start of the pandemic. As you are all aware, the past couple of years have come with varying levels of financial performance related to the pandemic impacts. There have been quarters where our stores were closed, when promotions were nearly nonexistent and quarters with higher and lower incentive compensation, just to name a few.\nWe also saw record levels of demand as people were spending more time in their homes and receiving government stimulus benefits. And now we are living through the pressures as we lap those periods. However, what has remained consistent over the past few years is the increased penetration of digital sales, which, as Corie mentioned, has nearly doubled since the start of the pandemic. As a result, over the past couple of years, we have modified our store operating model, highlighted new store formats and rolled out a new membership offering.\nTo better understand the financial impacts of all this change, I want to briefly give context on the decline in this year's non-GAAP operating rate outlook compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20 full year rate of 4.9% The First, our core domestic non-GAAP operating income rate has slightly improved as we have made structural changes in support of our increased digital sales mix, the reductions we have made in store payroll expenses largely offset increased parcel and inflationary supply chain costs as well as our increased technology investments that are designed to support a more digital shopping experience.\nOver the same time horizon, our core product margin rates have remained relatively unchanged. In addition, we have also improved the profitability of our International segment, which included the exit of our operations in Mexico. Second, the investments we've made in Totaltech, Best Buy Health and our retail store remodels represents approximately 130 basis points of non-GAAP operating income rate contraction.\nAs we have shared in the past, these initiatives come with near-term pressure, but we expect they will improve our profitability in the future. Third, this year's financial performance has benefited from lower incentive compensation when compared to fiscal '20. As we reset performance targets at the start of next year, this is not a structural benefit. This highlights how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives.\nLet me now transition to third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 10.4% on a comparable basis and our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.9% compared to 5.8% last year. Our gross profit rate decline of approximately 150 basis points was the primary driver of the lower operating income rate. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $188 million lower than last year, but were 40 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue.\nCompared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38 compared to $2.08 last year. A lower share count resulted in a $0.13 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. While our results were down to last year, our performance was ahead of our expectations we shared in our last earnings call. From a profitability standpoint, better-than-expected results were largely driven by disciplined expense management that resulted in favorable SG&A expense, both from a dollar and rate perspective.\nThe favorable SG&A was partially offset by slightly lower gross profit rate which was primarily the result of more promotional environment than we expected. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year before providing insights into how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 10.8% to $9.8 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 10.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, October's year-over-year comparable sales decline of 15% was the largest decline while September was our best-performing month. Conversely, when comparing to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 comparable period, October had the most growth, while Holiday Shopping was more prevalent this October compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20, it was lower than last year, when there was more of an urgency for consumers to get products early due to supply chain fears.\nIn our International segment, revenue decreased 14.9% to $787 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.3% in Canada and a negative impact of 480 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Turning now to gross profit. our enterprise rate declined 150 basis points to 22%. Our domestic gross profit rate also declined 150 basis points, with the primary drivers consistent with expectations as well as the past 2 quarters.\nThese drivers include: one, lower product margins, which were primarily due to increased promotions; two, lower services margins rates, including pressure from Totaltech; and three, the impact of higher supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's credit card arrangement. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. As Corie shared, we fully lapped last year's national rollout in October. As a result, the approximately 60 basis points headwind to last year from lower services margin rates was a sequential improvement from the past 2 quarters.\nMoving next to SG&A. As I stated earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $188 million while increasing 40 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary drivers were lower incentive compensation and reduced store payroll costs. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $100 million this quarter and $365 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense, which excludes the impact from incentive compensation, was favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales.\nInternational SG&A was $150 million, decreased $21 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The decrease was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 23.8% versus 25% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% versus our previous guidance of approximately 23%.\nThe lower outlook for the full year is primarily due to discrete tax matters in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $595 million and share repurchases of $465 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter and recently resumed repurchasing shares in early November.\nWe now expect to spend a total of approximately $1 billion in share repurchases this fiscal year. We are committed to being a premium dividend payer based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal '23, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of non-GAAP net income.\nWe view the target as a long term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should it fall outside the range in any 1 year. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. As we shared last quarter, the makeup of our capital expenditures looks a little different than last year with store-related investments representing a larger portion of our overall spending. Technology and digital capital are planned similar in terms of dollars versus last year, but its mix of overall capital spending is closer to 55% versus 75% last year.\nNext, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in our business, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $26 million of such restructuring costs in the third quarter and $61 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits.\nWe currently expect to incur additional charges to the fourth quarter for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter, starting with our topline expectations.\nWe are planning for comparable sales to decline approximately 10% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. The improved outlook for the full year is entirely driven by our third quarter results as our expectations remain unchanged for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that the current macro environment trends will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Although the year-over-year sales decline in Q4 is expected to be similar to sales decline we just reported for Q3. Our outlook implies a larger deceleration versus the pre-pandemic fiscal '20.\nAs expected, the year-over-year sales decline for the first 3 weeks of November is similar to the decline we saw in October. Moving next to profitability. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income rate to be slightly higher than our previous guidance of approximately 4%. Similar to our topline expectations, this improvement is driven by our third quarter performance.\nRelative to our previous expectations, we now expect SG&A to be a little more favorable, whereas we are factoring in a little more gross profit rate pressure due to increased promotional activity. For the fourth quarter specifically, but we still expect a majority of the year-over-year operating income rate decline to be driven by lower gross profit rate. There is less pressure than prior quarters as we lap Totaltech and some of the supply chain inflationary impacts.\nI will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.",

    "content": "Half Year 2023 Balfour Beatty PLC Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2023 Balfour Beatty PLC Earnings Call\n\nBBYLONDONAUG 16, 4:00 AM\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nGood morning, everybody. Judging by the size of the audience, it looks if you all delayed your summer holiday just to see these results. So I'm Leo Quinn, Balfour's Chief Executive. I'm joined by Phil Harrison, Chief Financial Officer. And we're going to give you an update on the half year performance.\nFirst and foremost, strong first half, and the progress that's been made is in the areas that you'd like to see it made. Earnings are up some 12% overall. But if you dig below, you'll see the U.K. earnings business is up some 60%. Hong Kong is up 40%. So very encouraging. Cash continues to be strong at just around GBP 700 million, if you actually add back the share buyback, which is just under GBP 100 million, it's almost flat with last year. So again, a strong, encouraging first half.\nThe most important thing about the business at the moment is just where we're positioned for future growth. And to my mind, it's never really been as encouraging or optimistic. Our growth is driven by things like sustainability and net 0 carbon and the likes of that. It doesn't matter whether you look at the demand side or the supply side. We're very, very well-positioned. What I mean by that, if you think about the supply side, whether it's offshore wind farms, whether it's nuclear power station, all forms of clean energy, we're actually a major player in that, and that's a rising tide for which we'll benefit from enormously.\nAnd then finally, in terms of delivering to shareholders, it is interesting. We announced our capital allocation model some 3 years ago. And in that period of time, we've returned some GBP 600 million in terms of cash and share buyback, which is 1/3 of our market cap. So very encouraging in terms of the earnings-based businesses are doing well. The market in which we sell is actually growing and the return to shareholders is substantial, and we sort of see future returns to shareholders as well.\nI want to point out here what effectively is some of our critical national infrastructure projects. And these are very, very important because our fortunes do rise and fall on how we execute on these contracts. It always helps us start with a good contract, make no mistakes, because they always come into play. But if I take you around these, the top left-hand picture that you see is actually a national grid job where we're doing the power transmission and underground cables from Hinkley power stations through to the grid. This job has been successfully completed. It was a fixed-price lump sum.\nThe reason this is important is as we go forward, and we see a growing energy market and energy security market. The nature of these contracts is going to change under the SD framework, where we'll have inflation protection and there's 2-step process. So you can see that in the future, we'll be derisking these jobs, which actually will bode well for margin returns.\nOn the top right, what we have here is this is Old Oak Common. And we are going to do a showcase at some point in terms of Old Oak Common. This is in London in the Acton area. And what you're seeing here is actually the box section that's being built. You can see the size and scale just by judging the 2 engineers that are in the base. This will constitute some 6 platforms for the new HS2 rail line, and that will connect with the Elizabeth line and the Great Western Railway and other 8 platforms. So this will be a huge station. It's actually the largest station under construction ever in the United Kingdom. Very exciting projects, and it's where HS2 will currently terminate for London.\nThe other end of the line, which is actually Kirson Street, which is actually in Birmingham. If you take the train into Birmingham New Street, the last 3 minutes of your journey, we'll actually see this project unfold. And there's 3 major structures in this area. What you're seeing here is actually this is the Y-shape peers and the bridge deck, which will be cast in the next week or 2. And you can see this unfolding before your eyes. It's an incredible project, and it's incredible for one reason. I started my career building a bridge in Balfour Beatty some 40-odd years ago. And one of that single bridge is a major project. Does 3 of those going on all in the same area, and it's all governed under 1 project office. So it's a very lean operation. It's very, very impressive.\nAnd then finally, if I look at Hong Kong to prove the international capability that we have. This is a T2 airport, and this is one of the roof structures. This is approximately 70 by about 36 meters, and it's actually being assembled on the ground and then jacked up into position.\nSo these major projects, this is what we do. This is our unique capability. It's not just about the engineering. It's about the contract and the commercial terms to manage this. And we forecast at this moment in time that we're on for our full year earnings around these projects. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hand over to Phil, who will treat you through some facts, and then I'll come back and treat you to the future.\n\nPhilip J. Harrison\n\nCFO & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThanks, Leo. And good morning, everyone. Let's start with the headline numbers.\nRevenue grew by 9% in the first half to GBP 4.5 billion, which was a 6% increase when excluding foreign exchange movements. Profit from the earnings-based businesses increased 12% with strong profit growth in U.K. Construction. However, group profit from operations reduced by 6%, with lower profits from the investments business, partially due to the timing of disposals. The benefit to the group's net finance income of higher interest rates was offset by a higher tax charge, as there was no additional deferred tax assets for U.K. tax losses recognized. When taken together, this resulted in an 8% decrease in profit for the period. However, earnings per share increased slightly to 13p, as the group's share buybacks took effect.\nOur GBP 16.4 billion order book has reduced by 6% in the period or 3% when excluding foreign exchange movements, and the director's valuation of the infrastructure portfolio remained at GBP 1.3 billion. Cash outflowed as forecast, with period end net cash of GBP 710 million and average net cash of GBP 695 million. In line with the policy for the interim dividend to be roughly 1/3 of the prior year's total dividend, the Board today is announcing an interim dividend per share of 3.5p. Looking forward to year-end, we remain on track to deliver full year earnings expectations.\nMoving on to the business units, and let's start with Construction Services. Profit from operations increased by 33% to GBP 65 million, driven by U.K. Construction and Gammon. In the U.K., revenue grew -- revenue growth of 23% was driven by increased HS2 volumes, which alongside improved delivery across the portfolio, took the profit margin to 2% compared to 1.5% a year ago. As a result, profit increased by 67% to GBP 30 million.\nTouching on HS2. Earlier this year, we were asked by the client to rephase work on our Area North contract. Having now worked through the change order and rebalance the workload, the adjustments have had no material impact on our forecasts. And we expect U.K. construction to deliver ahead of the 2.1% profit margin achieved in 2022.\nLooking beyond the U.K., U.S. Construction delivered GBP 21 million of profit, which was in line with the first half of 2022, and Gammon grew revenue and profit by around 40% and driven by the major Hong Kong airport projects. The Construction Services order book reduced by 8% in the first half, or 5% at constant exchange rates. In the U.K. and Gammon, the increases in activity at HS2 and Hong Kong airport, which have driven the revenue upwards, have in turn, reduced the order book. In the U.S., we continue to see delays in commercial office projects going to contract, particularly in Texas, as customers waited for more positive economic news with U.S. inflation reducing to around 3%, we have started to see some early signs of awarded work progressing to contract. We've also had some further U.S. awards in the first half, which are yet to go to contract, including a $650 million project at [ Rally Doram ] Airport in North Carolina, where the contract the awards will come in stages phased over the multiyear project.\nI'll touch quickly on our GBP 5.9 billion U.K. construction order book. as its contract mix is a great indicator of the changes which the business has seen. Not only does the volume of future orders provide visibility for the short and medium term, but the weighting of orders by contract type also reflects the improved risk profile. 84% of the order book is covered by target cost and cost plus contracts, which protect the group from inflation risk, and the majority of the fixed price work is priced over 2 stages, allowing for the additional risk mitigation. We also continued to work almost exclusively with public and regulated clients, which reduces risk further. We will continue to favor those projects with lower risk contract terms that provide stability and predictability to the group.\nMoving on to the Support Services Business, which comprises our power, road and rail maintenance businesses. Revenue reduced by 7% in the first half, driven by the timing of power projects. Support Services PFO reduced by GBP 6 million to GBP 30 million, due largely to the lower revenue in Power and higher costs in the Road Maintenance Business, where 2 new long-term contracts were launched. As we bring the new contracts onto our systems and align them to our ways of working, additional costs are required upfront, but this is built into our expectations when planning the projects. With these 2 new contracts now in place, revenue from the Road Maintenance Business is expected to be higher going forward.\nLooking towards the second half, we continue to expect the full year PFO margin to be towards the top end of our 6% to 8% targeted range, with all 3 businesses performing well. In the medium term, the Power Business is poised to see significant growth as the industry responds to the government's need to invest heavily in the grid. Last week, we were appointed to SSE's GBP 10 billion as the framework, and we're also bidding on national grids equivalent, great grid upgrade framework with project delivery expected to begin in 2025.\nMoving to infrastructure investments. In our infrastructure investment business, our pretax profit has reduced from GBP 24 million to GBP 14 million, due to 2 main factors. We made no disposals in the period compared to GBP 7 million last year. By its nature, disposals are lumpy, and we continue to target gains on investment disposals in the range of GBP 15 million to GBP 30 million for 2023. In the U.S., there's been an increase in military housing costs, relating to the independent compliance monitors first year of work.\nWithin the pretax profit, there's also an offset between operating profit and interest receivable of GBP 3 million, driven by higher interest rates on the subordinated debt provided by the group to some joint ventures. It is important to note that this does not impact the cash distributions received by the group, but does require the returns to be presented differently in the accounts. Looking to the second half and our planned disposals, we are currently engaged in marketing a number of assets, which we plan to close out by year-end. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach and our priority remains focused on maximizing value.\nLet me take you through our valuation of the portfolio now. As a reminder, at year-end, we had our valuation independently verified by a third-party expert, and the methodology used for the half year valuation has not been changed. During the first half of 2023, we have invested GBP 24 million in new and existing projects, including the addition of 1 student accommodation project in Florida. We expect to make further investments in the second half, as we continue to see opportunities to invest at our target return rates.\nDuring the period, we received GBP 33 million of distributions from the projects, and the function of reducing the discount by 6 months increased the valuation by GBP 42 million. Foreign exchange rate changes have had a negative impact. 58% of our portfolio's value was in North American investments, and the weakening of the dollar has driven a GBP 39 million decrease. And finally, operational performance has reduced the valuation by GBP 16 million, as higher U.S. insurance premiums and an increase to our estimates of costs related to the monitors work were reflected in the period. These costs were partially offset by U.K. student accommodation rent increases. This has resulted in a valuation reducing marginally, but still remaining around GBP 1.3 billion.\nOur cash flow performance in the period has been in line with our expectations, with the closing balance reducing by about GBP 100 million. Operating cash flow remained strong and was marginally higher than the prior year, and the 2 largest outflows, being working capital and the share buyback program, were both flagged at year-end. We are expecting a further working capital unwind in the second half, and continue to expect the full year unwind to be between GBP 75 million and GBP 125 million.\nWe have also given guidance today for 2023 average net cash, which we expect to be in the range of GBP 650 million to GBP 700 million. One other item worth noting is the pension deficit payments of GBP 13 million, which have come down from GBP 29 million, following an agreement with the trustees of our largest pension fund earlier in the year. The contributions are expected to remain at this lower level in the medium term and for self-sufficiency to be reached in 2027.\nI'll finish with our capital allocation framework. We are continuing to invest in organic growth opportunities, with not only further additions to our investment portfolio, but also by investing in capability across the earnings-based businesses which Leo will talk to shortly. We also expect to realize value from the investments portfolio. And as mentioned, we're planning for disposals in the second half of 2023. We have taken active steps in the first half to further strengthen our balance sheet, and have refinanced our revolving credit facility by replacing the old GBP 375 million facility which was due to expire next year, with a new GBP 475 million facility, which runs to 2027 with a further 1-year extension option.\nThe Board has declared an interim dividend of 3.5p per share, which is aligned to the policy of being roughly 1/3 of the prior year's full dividend. And finally, we're on track to finish 2023's GBP 150 million share buyback program in the fourth quarter of the year, and continue to expect the capital allocation framework to be in place for years to come. With that, I'll hand you back to Leo.\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThank you. I'll start here, but I'll just reflect on something that Phil said. When you think about the capital allocation model, our #1 priority for cash is to invest back in the existing business. And given the rising tide and the size of the opportunity, now is an ideal time to be investing in selling expense to cope with the demand for bids that is coming out in the marketplace. So we'll see that investment in selling actually increasing.\nAnd if I point you towards the slide on the left-hand side, I showed you this slide last time, and it's worth just going around it to understand, as I said last time, we're sort of like the Intel Inside, we're the enabler that makes a lot of these things possible. But working all the way from submersible, semisubmersible platforms with the likes of ACA in terms of the future of offshore wind farms, we're one of the largest supplier of pylons and transmission cables for the grid to help derisk the grid. Small modular reactors, we're looking to play with Holtec, but there's an awful lot of players coming out in the market, and it's all quite an interesting space, whether it be fusion or conventional energy, nuclear energy, the likes of Hinkley, we see growth with Sizewell. So again, exciting in that area.\nWe made a small investment in terms of EV charging to capitalize on the demand in that market. And we're an active FEED studies and the like around carbon capture and hydrogen. So the space is actually very, very exciting. And since we spoke about this 6 months ago, what we've seen is that the, what I would call the mobilization risk, in terms of these are such big markets and such big opportunities. It's too expensive for any one company to go in on their own. So what the government is doing is it's launching the Asti framework, which is about derisking the grid. It's looking at carbon capture, and it's looking at small nuclear reactors. And it's actually putting up a summer money to enable these things to happen.\nWe, at this moment in time, are working on FEED studies and enabling work to make these real. So we're actively engaged in actually setting the stage and the foundation to make these things possible. So it is very exciting, and I'll touch on it in the next few slides. But this is a growth market for which we are uniquely positioned to actually capitalize on that.\nIn our Support Services business, which also feeds into the same market, in our power T&D, we're off to a very good start. But I'll point you again to SSE's assay framework. That's already been put out and bid National Grid will probably make some decisions around the first quarter of next year. I would anticipate between 25 and 30 and maybe even towards the end of '24, that there will be an additional GBP 2 billion to GBP 3 billion worth of business over that 5-year period, which is substantial growth.\nSo in terms of that power T&D, you're looking to the upper end of doubling that business by 2027, '28. In terms of road and road maintenance, again, a nice business that we seem to manage very successfully. We won 2 contracts in the first half of the year with [ ESA ] and [ Buckinshere ], and we're mobilizing those. We're targeting one more local authority next year. Again, so what we're seeing is good double-digit returns, and we're seeing good growth in that area.\nIn terms of the rail, the CRSA contract is performing very well. Also, the London underground in terms of the upgrade as the Piccadilly line was our power traction is doing well. We see growth coming in the areas of the Midland Mainline electrification, but also there's the track slab from HS2. And again, in line of investing, all of these take substantial resources and actually investing. And the challenge at the moment is, it's like London buses, there's 3 of them coming out one, and we've got to work out how we handle that peak loading.\nBut the stuff we do here is very traditional. We put cables across the Highlands. We operate central monitoring stations for road maintenance and we actually repair railways. This is the new non repair where the line was shut for 10 weeks. And we put a small team in there and actually restored the bridge to foundations at record time and released it back to the client early.\nI want to point this out in light of the slide I showed you with the pictures of what we're doing. What's interesting in that first slide was, if you look at the transmission job, which is on the top left, the old framework was fixed-price lump sum. If I look at the HS2, those particular contracts were derisked for inflation, and they were an incentivized, cost plus and incentivized fee. What we're looking to do is move all of these frameworks into areas whereby the inflation risk is not ours. It stays with the customer, which is fair because that's actually where the returns are ultimately, and that we understand how we've derisked the contract in order to make sure that, that derisking improves margins.\nSo in the case of cabling here, we've talked about the Asti framework and the size and scale of this opportunity. But what you see is the pilot and the wiring. What you don't see is what we do underneath it. So we have specialist design capability. We actually do the piling. We do the power cap. We put the roads in, in order to reach these items. And the way this will be contracted in bid will be a 2-step process. So effectively, we will put our team together with the clients team. We'll look at the DCOs, we'll look at the engineer and then we look at the actual execution of the job. And then when that Phase 1 is done, we'll then decide on what basis we perform through to the final contract. So that's 2-stage distribution is that most of the risk will be designed out in Phase 1 before we actually enter a final contract in Phase 2, substantially different to where we are today.\nAnd if I look at nuclear power stations, the important thing about Sizewell is Sizewell is the intelligent replication of Hinkley. So the lessons to be learned from Hinkley will be transferred here. We carried out all the marine works and the tunnels and we'll be doing the same here. But we're looking to add the enabling works and the earthworks. Just as a matter of interest, the earthworks here on Sizewell are substantial, but there are about 20% of the earthworks that we've done on N1 and 2 on HS2. So you can see we're uniquely qualified to do that.\nAnd in the enabling works, we'll be doing things around the preconstruction design we'll be looking at the ground engineering. The biggest piece of it will actually be the diaphragm wall, which actually will surround the whole site. Interesting enough, the last time we built a diaphragm wall size we will size will be 40 years ago. So we're redoing what we actually did for Sizewell B will be for Sizewell C. But again, this unique capability underneath all gets applied to the success. And why is this important? Because ultimately, it gives the client better assurance. It comes with our safety standards, it comes with our quality workmanship.\nSo what you see in, for example, in the power business, is this element delivered here. What you don't see is how all this is delivered across our other businesses, including our plant and fleet. So this is a substantial opportunity, but it's also substantially derisked in the way the order book has been managed in the past. Very, very exciting.\nIn the United States, really not much different from what I reported 6 months ago. 2 challenging areas. We've got the Northwest, which is funded really by the tech sector, the Facebooks, the Amazon, the Microsoft and the likes of that. We've seen that market slowing. In Texas, which is largely a developer market influenced by interest rates, we've seen that slow. Interestingly, in Texas is that the work is piling up. We've got our largest order book of awarded but not contracted. The challenge is, until the developers get certainty, they won't move it into contract.\nAnd so we're sort of, we've got a lot of pent-up demand here. What we are seeing is still strong growth in California in schools. The federal market in Washington, D.C. is going well, and of course, in Florida with Mickey Mouse and Universal, we've got great growth in hotels, leisure and the likes of that. So exciting.\nWe're not standing around waiting for growth to actually happen. We are investing. So what we've done is we've invested in Jacksonville and Sacramento as 2 new branches. As you know, our business is a local business, because it's a local supply chain when you're in building and construction. And under that scenario, we're seeing really good activity in both of those, in particular, Sacramento.\nAnd then our smaller branches, we're actually doubling down and investing in the [ roles ], the Austin and the Phoenix in order to grow those, and that's on top of the base business that you've seen. So we see '24, '25 seeing some really good growth in revenue in those new areas. Also, we're focusing on the airport market. We just won a contract in Sacramento for effectively bridge connectors, which is something we took from the LAX. We just won another contract in Raleigh, and we won in Jacksonville. Those 3 are just under $1 billion, and they will be delivered over the next 2 years or so. So again, a lot going on there.\nFinally, in terms of the infrastructure in the civil market, there is growth in that market. And of course, there's the Biden inflation reduction act, but the U.S. market is still fixed-price lump sum. So the risk actually sits largely with us. So until that matures in line with what we see in the U.K., we're just going to be more cautious in terms of the large projects that we endeavor to take on in that area. But again, U.S. is a solid performer just waiting for the dam to break so that we can be more optimistic about the outlook for next year and the year after.\nIn the case of Gammon, which is our joint venture with Jardine Matheson. In their market, this is a -- they are a substantial player, very high profile, very, very strong brand, very good business. It almost replicates what we do in the U.K. in terms of capability, all those things around piling, concrete delivery, design, temporary works, all of this goes on in Gammon. And it is a GBP 2 billion business. So it's not far off the size of the U.K. business, about half.\nBasically, this is a very, very strong market. It's centrally planned, and since the change of all the formalization of government, what we've actually seen is that the markets moved forward very, very positively. Historically, we've seen a very strong building market and residential. With interest rates higher, we've now seen that starting to fall off, but infrastructure is beefing up and again, substantially in terms of building the infrastructure, which is supporting the focused markets around the region of tech, IT, data centers, R&D centers. And a lot of this is going to be supported by the rollout of 5 MTR new stations and the rail tracks associated with them.\nWe've just bid 1 station with MTR and that would be circa GBP 1 billion. When that's completed, it will come with the deck platform. And then what they'll do is they'll build out commercially on top of that, commercial and residential. So you can see by actually putting the station in, it positions you well for the next phase of building on top of that. So we're seeing, again, strong growth with MTR. All the customers we deal with in this region, they are long established relationships. And that's important because when things go wrong, we know how they behave and how they respond. And MTR has been a customer for a very, very long time, as have many of our buildings customers.\nSo we're very selective in what we're bidding. There's not any growth, by the way, in Hong Kong and around there. There is the Northern Metropolis, which we've talked about before. There is the Macau casinos, which are growing as well. So this is a vibrant market. We're only constrained not by opportunity, but actually by capability and people that we can hire. Interesting enough, the government in Hong Kong recently have just changed the rules around bringing in expert labor, which is going to relieve the pressure on head count and capability, which actually will help spur growth in the future.\nIf I look at our investment business, Phil has talked to this at nauseam. Second half, we're looking at the divestments in that business. But as we've always said, if we're not getting the right return on those investments, we're not apt to rush out and sell them for the sake of selling because these are actually performing yielding assets. So it really is a question around do we just want to keep the yield or do we actually want to take the capital gain.\nWe continue to make investments. As you know, we invested in EV charging company, which we named Urban Fox. That was a small investment, but the premise of the strategy was around. We have good relationship with local authorities. And there's really good demand for EV charging at the moment. And it's not outside London, the satisfaction levels are really low. So we're quite optimistic about that as a long-term play.\nWe've invested GBP 24 million in assets. The largest was Tallahassee, Florida, which was a student accommodation. We also completed the build of the Vandervelde student accommodation in Nashville. And we also won the William & Mary College in Virginia. So again, there's a lot of stuff going along under the surface here. We're really committed to consume accommodation in the U.K. and the U.S. We've got 2 major projects in the U.K., which we're trying to get to close in the second half of the year. U.S. multifamily housing, we continue to invest in that. P3 is the biggest opportunity here.\nAs you remember, the LAX People Mover, which is this P3 here, is value at about GBP 2.6 billion, and we're looking to capitalize on that. And the next bid we'll be doing is the Prince George County Schools in Washington, D.C. And that, again, is the most -- is the biggest opportunity that we've got on the plate at the moment. The unfortunate thing about P3 is it just seems to take years to get these things to fruition. So there's a heavy upfront investment before you get the returns. And of course, we're looking to actively play in the U.K. energy transition market.\nIf I look at building new futures, nothing new here in terms of carbon materials and communities in that we've maintained our 2030 strategy and targets. We've made fantastic progress under the leadership for sustainability. We've completed our work on the pathway to decarbonizing for Scope 1, 2 and 3. We'll be submitting in the second half of the year to the body of the science-based targets, in order to ensure that we don't exceed the 1.5 degrees temperature rise globally. We are confident of this going through very well.\nIt is interesting between Scope 1 and 2, which is what we do internally around carbon and energy versus Scope 3. Scope 1 and 2 actually only equal 3% of our overall carbon footprint. So you can see that it means we've got an awful lot to do with the supply chain to represent the other 97%, and although we've made great inroads in terms of reducing idling, changing out diesel to electric and the likes of that, it's still sort of just a small microcosm on the scale. Areas where we've made great progress is -- and the area I'm focused on the most is really around how do we drive more social value. Because we have the ability to put things back into communities in order to make communities better places. We spent GBP 125 million in locally generated economic value by placing work with local suppliers. We've trained over 2,000 days of training for people coming into the business.\nAnd interesting enough, on this one here, we've trained or taken over have taken out over 300 people who were long-term unemployed and put them into jobs. So we're giving people what are the basic skills to make them productive members of the community. And I think the social benefit that comes from what we do just in our day-to-day business is fantastic. This is 1 job. We have 600 other jobs. And across the group, we're trying to do these things all the time. And of course, we still run the 5% club, which is around getting young people, whether apprentices or graduates, into the workplace early and giving them skills for life.\nSo finally, we're on track for the full year. We're positioned really well to capitalize on growth, whether on the demand side or the supply side. Over the last 3 years, we delivered GBP 600 million return to shareholders. We're confident about future returns. Business is in good shape for the full year, and we're confident that we'll deliver on expectations. Great, great future for the growth in this business. And now I hand back to Phil for all the questions.",

Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nGood morning, everybody. It's quite interesting actually. The future of our industry and especially in the next 5 to 10 years is all going to be predicated on our ability to attract the best and the brightest. It's not about the demand, it's about the ability to actually supply and satisfy that demand, which is a nice place to be.\nIt's quite interesting, as I talked to apprentices and graduates and people within the company, what I talk about is engineering is really cool. But more specifically, what we do within Balfour Beatty is even cooler. And this photograph really sums that up because what you're looking at here is actually one of the tunnels that will feed the cold water from the Bristol channel and cool the reactor of the new Hinkley Power Point Station. So if ever there's been a good picture to talk about cool industry, this is the one.\nGood morning. I'm Leo Quinn, Balfour Beatty's, Chief Executive, and I'm going to talk about the group's first half performance for 2022. If you look at the financials, it's a really strong performance for the first half. It doesn't matter what measure you look at, whether it be profit, the value of the investment portfolio, the order book, cash flow or whatever. However, the numbers are flattered by the fact that when you compare it with the first half of last year, we did have the long tail of COVID. So that didn't actually give us the best performance that we would have liked. But I think even in light of that, this is a strong performance.\nWhat you can't see in the numbers is really the fact that the underlying momentum in the business is extremely strong. And I can take you to the takeaway on this slide is that really gives us confidence in upgrading the full year. So it's a really good position to be in. I'm also very pleased to say that we've repositioned the portfolio over the last 2 or 3 years. And it's a larger portfolio, but it's significantly derisked, and that derisking makes us more confident that we can actually deliver the returns within it.\nThe portfolio is underpinned by a set of capability, which I'll present the slide in the next section, which shows a decade of infrastructure growth and all those things that you've seen in the video, how they come to bear in making us probably the preferred choice of supplier in that market. We've got a very attractive portfolio of investment assets, which does 2 things. One is it's actually it's a store of value. And coupled with that, it's also a good future growth pipeline that we've got. And we put all of that together gives us an awful lot of confidence. So we've raised the dividend to 3.5p and a 17% increase.\nSo why are we confident? Well, if you look at the Construction Services, there's a number of things going on here, which actually allows us to take ourselves back to the 2% to 3% margin or average margins that we see in this sector. The first is that we've pivoted the business towards infrastructure. And that has 2 benefits. One is the market is very, very large. It has a very sensible customer. And we have terms and conditions which are much more manageable.\nThe second thing is, is that in the U.S., over the last 3 years, we've been looking very strongly at the federal market and that moves us away from -- in times of high interest rates. It moves us away from the developer market. So therefore, it mitigates some of the risk. And then thirdly, we announced last time that we were suspending developer work in high-rise buildings in London. Again, that's given us another fill-up. So we feel very confident about the 2%, 3% industry average margins that we've talked about in the past.\nIf I look at Support Services, again, we've transformed that business where we completed the framework in gas and water. Those have now largely been concluded and tied out. That leaves us with 3 businesses in terms of road, rail and power. All 3 businesses are performing very well at this moment in time. And therefore, as a result, what we're talking about is moving to the upper end of expectations in terms of the 8%. And we're pretty confident about that for the full year.\nAnd then thirdly, if you look at our Infrastructure portfolio, it was a superb asset to have actually in the books. Not only is the valuation increased by some GBP 200 million and we can be confident about that, exchange rate has helped, inflation has helped. But if you look at the divestments of Purdue and you look at the other assets we've got, they're all being sold at significantly above the Director's valuation. So again, another store of value and also a store of future growth. All businesses are sort of performing well at this time.\nNow I always talk about the cash doesn't lie. And here is our cash flow performance. And although it irritates Phil, my Finance Director, enormously that I should talk about cash because he feels it's his domain. If you look at how we've progressed over the last 5-year period here, it is year-on-year consistent performance.\nAnd that does come from operating profit, but it also comes from the management and the effective management of working capital. If I compare the first half of 2022 with the first half of 2021, we're up by some GBP 200 million. And that's despite the fact that we've done a share buyback of some GBP 180 million. And we've actually done a dividend as well.\nPut those 2 together, the cash we've spent on buybacks and dividends is some GBP 227 million to date since the beginning of 2021. And there's also a material cash expenditure in the second half of this year. So cash performance is strong. That gives me a lot of confidence in terms of underpinning future returns and our capital allocation model.\nPhil, over to you, and you can take them through the facts.\n\nPhilip J. Harrison\n\nCFO & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThanks, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the headline numbers. We have reported strong financial performance for the first half of 2022, with total underlying profit from operations of GBP 85 million being 42% higher than the first half of 2021, with all businesses performing well.\nProfit from operations from the earnings-based businesses was also GBP 85 million and up 42%, with U.K. construction returning to profitability and improved underlying margins at Support Services. Earnings per share at 12.9p is significantly ahead of the 7.7p delivered for the same period last year.\nOur total order book at GBP 17.7 billion has grown by 10% in the first half or 4% excluding foreign exchange movements, with increases across all construction geographies, while the Directors' valuation increased to GBP 1.3 billion, up from GBP 1.1 billion at year-end, of which nearly half was due to the weakening of the pound.\nAverage net cash at GBP 811 million and period end net cash of GBP 742 million continues to underpin the group's competitive advantage and supports our long-term capital allocation framework. As a result of this strong performance, the Board today is announcing an interim dividend per share of 3.5p.\nMoving on to the business units, and let's start with Construction Services. Underlying profit of GBP 49 million reflected higher contributions from each of the 3 geographies. In the U.K., profit from the operations of GBP 18 million with an achieved margin of 1.5% represents a return to profitability compared to a loss in the first half of 2021. Profit at U.S. construction and Gammon were both slightly up with margin percentages in line with the first half of 2021.\nIn the second half of the year, we expect the profit margin in U.K. construction to improve as our remaining fixed price residential property projects in Central London move towards completion, and the proportion of revenue earned from public sector infrastructure projects increases further. We currently forecast full year margin for U.K. construction in the range of 2% to 3%.\nTouching on the U.K. construction order book quickly, which is increased by GBP 200 million to GBP 5.8 billion in the first half of the year and has continued to derisk. As you know, we are actively pursuing a shift away from fixed price projects and now have a much higher proportion of target cost and cost plus work in our U.K. order book.\nSimilarly, we're reducing our exposure to private developers. And at the half year, 92% of the U.K. construction order book was from public and regulated clients. This is aligned to Balfour Beatty's focus on selectively bidding for contracts where it holds expert capability and can achieve improved contract terms. This has resulted in a higher quality order book with enhanced risk protection, providing more predictable outcomes.\nIn comparison, in the U.S., our order book has grown 17% to GBP 6.3 billion. U.S. market is predominantly bid on a fixed price basis, which we managed through early subcontractor buyouts typically within 30 to 60 days. The supply chain is then covered by bonding insurance, mitigating the risk in the business.\nMoving on to Support Services. As Leo said, the impact of repositioning the business to focus on power, road and rail maintenance can be seen in the results delivered for the first half. Revenue declined by 28% in utilities following the group's strategic decision to exit gas and water and focus on the more profitable power and transportation markets. After adjusting for GBP 20 million of prior-year one-offs reported in the first half of 2021, profit from operations increased by GBP 2 million despite the reduction in revenue.\nThis represented a 7.2% profit margin in the top half of the targeted margin range of 6% to 8%. And we have now upgraded our expectations for the full year, with margins forecast to be at the top end of this range. Support Services is underpinned by long-term frameworks in power, road and rail maintenance, giving us visibility and confidence that we can remain in the top half of our targeted range in the medium term.\nTurning to Infrastructure Investments. Pre-disposal operating profit increased by GBP 2 million to GBP 10 million as a result of increasing returns on projects as income has increased with inflation. We also realized a gain on disposal of GBP 7 million following the sale of a multifamily housing project in Houston in June with the transaction above Directors' valuation. The business continues its disciplined approach to target a 2x return on its invested capital as we continue to see good market opportunities.\nDuring the period, the group invested GBP 17 million in new or existing projects, including a multifamily housing project in San Antonio. The Directors' valuation increased to GBP 1.3 billion in the first half. However, we would expect this number to reduce by year-end as the previously announced Purdue disposal completed last week, and we anticipate at least 1 further disposal in the second half. We now expect full year profit on disposals to be in the range of GBP 55 million to GBP 65 million.\nLooking briefly at our track record on investment disposals, as I've just covered. With the disposals in Houston and at Purdue University, we now have 2 further investments sold above the Director's valuation. These disposals further demonstrate the strength of the secondary market for infrastructure assets and the value which our investment portfolio brings to the group. We will continue to time disposals to ensure we maximize value for shareholders.\nLet me now talk you through the valuation. The GBP 190 million increase in the Director's valuation since year-end. The first 4 items here largely net out. So I'll focus on the 3 blue columns -- the final 3 blue columns. The valuation has benefited from a weaker pound in the first half, 57% of the portfolio's value was in North American investments at the start of the year, and the shift in exchange rates has driven an GBP 86 million increase.\nFurthermore, higher inflation than forecast has led to an increase in the value of some U.K. projects, totaling GBP 52 million, and I'll cover this in more detail on the next slide. Finally, there was an additional GBP 41 million increase, largely driven by the revaluation of various projects including those disposed to date, giving us a half year Director's valuation of GBP 1.3 billion.\nLet me cover inflation now and the impact which we're seeing across the group, starting with the investments portfolio, which is benefiting from the increase. In the U.K., most of the contracts are linked to RPI, and recent rises in inflation have resulted in a GBP 52 million increase in the Director's valuation. In the U.S., the portfolio is also positively correlated with inflation, but indirectly through the link to the rental market.\nSo you would expect income to increase over time. However, in the construction and infrastructure markets, we are seeing inflationary pressures in relation to both labor and materials. Whilst the group is not immune to these pressures, we are currently mitigating these risks through contractual protection and early buyout using the group's scale and supply chain management. As a result, we do not expect to see a material impact from inflation in 2022.\nMoving on to cash flow, which has once again been strong in the first half. Average month-end net cash of GBP 811 million was GBP 140 million higher than 2021, although the closing balance was GBP 48 million lower than year-end. As forecast in March, we've seen a working capital outflow in the period, while all other items have largely been in line with expectations. Our share buyback program started in mid-March, so will be second half weighted with GBP 47 million of our stated GBP 150 million target completed in the first half.\nOur consistent cash flow performance gives me confidence that our full year average net cash will be in the range of GBP 740 million to GBP 780 million. This includes a further working capital outflow in the second half prior to a more material working capital outflow in 2023, as we move towards our long-term 11% to 13% of revenue range.\nTurning to our multiyear capital allocation framework that we launched last year. We continue to see a wide range of opportunities to invest in organic growth, and Leo will touch on the scale of this in his section. I've just mentioned 2 great examples of us realizing value from the investments portfolio, and we'll continue to do this with a higher Director's valuation demonstrating the opportunities available.\nThe balance sheet remains strong, and we have raised new U.S. private placement debt in the first half in anticipation of repaying debt falling due early next year. The refinancing has extended the debt maturity profile of the group. These factors give us confidence to grow the dividends with 3.5p per share recommended for half year. And our 2022 GBP 150 million share buyback program is on track to complete in the second half.\nWe expect this framework to be in place for a number of years to come and to give our shareholders confidence in the returns available. This is underpinned in the short term by our full year guidance, which I'll recap now.\nWe now expect U.K. construction to deliver profit in the industry standard margin target range of 2% to 3% for 2022. This is an improvement on the first half. At U.S. construction and Gammon, we remain in line with expectations for the full year. We are upgrading our expectations for Support Services at the top of its range of 6% to 8%, above the 7.2% achieved in the first half. And in investments, profit on disposal for the full year is expected to be in the range of GBP 55 million to GBP 65 million.\nMoving on to cash. We will complete the remaining GBP 103 million of the '22 share buyback in the second half. And we now expect average cash at year-end to be in the range of GBP 740 million to GBP 780 million, and that includes a further outflow in the second half on working capital. We are pleased with the financial performance to date and to be able to upgrade expectations for the full year.\nOn that note, I'll hand you back to Leo.\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThank you, Phil. That was very instructive. The thing I would point out is that it's great to show and demonstrate a set of numbers. But what's really important is what's behind it and what differentiates us and what actually makes it repeatable because one-off events are not bankable. And this is really what makes it repeatable.\nWe've got highly differentiated capability in the company built around our infrastructure assets. And these are just some examples, and they're really quite stellar. The top left is actually the Hong Kong airport. It's the new terminal building there. And that roof is assembled on the ground and yanked into position. Again, nothing revolutionary about that, but it's safer, but the scale and the size of it is quite incredible and the logistics to do it.\nIf that wasn't impressive enough, the top right here is what's going on at Hinkley as we speak. The 2 cranes either side are the size of a football pitch, just to get your eye into this. And that little white concrete thing in the middle is 5,000 tons. And it's a tandem lift to the seabed where that head will then be connected with the cooling tunnels that I showed you earlier in this industry of ours, which is cool. And that will then form the mechanism for the water to flow into the reactor and to cooler. Just an absolutely major engineering feat to pull this off, and I think it's almost a world first.\nUp in Boston, we're just completing the Green Line. We've opened the first section. I think the second section will open shortly. And that's where we're connecting to an existing train line. We are building 5 kilometers or 5 miles of track with 5 new stations and refurbishing 2 existing stations. Again, a real challenging engineering project.\nAnd then the bottom right, High Speed 2. This is the first tunnel that's being completed on HS2. And what you see here is the tunneling machine breaking through. That tunnel is about a mile. It's under (inaudible). And again, it was completed about 2 weeks ago. So again, really interesting stuff. And not only do we do this for a living, we actually get paid to do this for a living. So how exciting can it get.\nThis is probably the most important slide in the pack for me. And really, what it's doing is now describing how that capability that I've shown you is going to demonstrate and create recurring value over what effectively is the next decade. And if you look at HS2, just as an example, you can see that the revenues are starting to peak '23, '24, and then it will be coming off.\nYou can see that the HS2 track and OCS, that's effectively the track that the train will run on, and the cabling that will provide the electricity in terms of the catenary above. And 2a is the extension to Crewe and then 2b is up to Manchester. So you can see that this revenue stream is going to go on for a long, long time.\nWe sometimes don't make a lot about it, but we're doing all of the northern section around Birmingham, N1 and N2. But also we're doing the Old Oak Common down in Acton. And that actually, for us, is a fee-based contract. So we get a fee on whatever we spend and the risk and the cost flows through to the end customer.\nSo that in itself is really exciting. If you look at Hinkley, where we're doing the mechanical and electrical, we're doing the heads that you've seen. We've done the tunnel boring there as well. And you can see that's going to peak about '23, and then actually tail off to -- after about 24%.\nComing then, you've got -- coming on stream, you've then got the likes of Sizewell. And although Sizewell at this moment in time is talked about in terms of whether it will or won't go ahead. If you look at energy security, invariably Sizewell or something equivalent to it has to actually go ahead. So Sizewell, you can see, is a sizable project where we'll have a major stake.\nAnd then modular reactors will also come into play as well, whichever offering it is, whether it's Rolls-Royce or Westinghouse or General Electric, doesn't really matter, but it's going to be a market for that as well.\nIf you then start to look at some of the new areas, which effectively are supported by government but they're not necessarily funded by government, this is your Net Zero Teesside, your hydrogen for Humberside and they're going to have a material play for us in the future. Then you've got also your offshore wind.\nIf I think about these as actually major fiscal expansion effectively funded by government, it's a very different game to playing with private development. And so there's a lot more security. The good news is provided you follow the right processes, you get paid, and the client actually has the money to pay you, which is not always the case in other markets.\nThis actually -- this growth sits atop of what effectively is our core business. And our core business in the likes of rail, and I'll touch on this more later at CP6 and CP7, which is the maintenance. You've got your highways, whether it's your RIS or your smart motorways. You've got our CPS, which is a 25-year -- sorry, 40-year M25 maintenance.\nYou've got the power contracts and then you've got our regional work, whether it's through our defense, whether it's through the SCAPE framework and the likes of that. So, all in all, you've got this growth opportunity here, sitting really on top of what is our core business. And this for us will designate a decade of infrastructure growth for Balfour Beatty and for the U.K. industry.\nOffshore wind is a really important area because not taking into account in what you see here is this next slide. And the U.K. energy security and the Net zero, the size of the opportunity is about GBP 20 billion. And that's actually making sure that our infrastructure onshore is effectively resilient enough in order to take what are all the new mixture of cocktails of power coming onto the grid. So whether it be wind from the Eastern -- East Coast or the Irish Sea, all of that has to come onshore, it has to be connected and then actually has to be to a robust and reliable infrastructure.\nAnd if you look at our experience, ElecLink is where we took an interconnector from France through the channel tunnel connected up to the U.K. grid. Littlebrook, we just recently upgraded and serviced the substation here, which serves 1.5 million customers. Our work on Hinkley, Net Zero Teesside and the idea of how we put substations in place to take offshore wind. All of those represent quite unique capability.\nAnd this is all founded on top of what are our specialist engineering areas, whether it be design, ground engineering, mechanical power transmission. This is a highly differentiated end-to-end solution, which makes us, I believe, quite invaluable to our customer base. So really, really encouraged by the future that I see spelt out for our industry, but in -- Balfour Beatty in particular.\nIf I move to the United States for a few minutes and have a look here. First and foremost, it's a very interesting 6 months. The first 3 months was quite stark. There wasn't a lot going on. And in the second 3 months, it was almost like a Tsunami of orders actually hit us. It was quite important because in the first quarter of the year, we stayed away from getting caught in a market where everybody was bidding to get volume. So we held our nerve and then the second quarter, the market came back and normalized.\nWe've had, I suppose, a record first half in terms of bookings and what we call awarded but not contracted. So we know awards that we're going to receive. And that gives us very, very good visibility in terms of '23 and '24, which is quite important. The second thing is we have 2 businesses in the United States or 2 business models. There's the building business and then there's the civils business.\nAbout 80% of our portfolio is buildings. And the way buildings works is that we will effectively go out and look at a job with the supply chain. We will cost it up, and then we will add a 4-plus percent fee to that job. When the job is awarded, it is immediately passed down to the supply chain that they contract it with their supply base. What this does is it means that the inflation risk is actually in the estimate or it's contracted back into the supply chain. It doesn't sit with us.\nAnd then our fee of 4% plus is virtually guaranteed. Now when you take overhead of that, that means that your operating profit is around -- between 1% and 2%. So it may not sound like a big profit, but effectively, it's a mitigated risk profit because the risk lies with your supply chain or ultimately your end customer because our fee is guaranteed. That represents about 80% of the volume you see in the United States, and I'll touch on that volume in a second.\nThe other area we've got, which is the remaining 20%, is our civils business. That's largely fixed price lump sum. It can be the area of some of the completion of the water works that we do in rail and also in roads. That's a higher risk model because it is at risk lump sum fee. So what we decide is how much of that we want in our portfolio at any one time. And we can moderate that up or down depending on the bids that we see.\nWhere do we operate in the United States? We've said this 100 times before. We operate largely in The Southern Smile, which you can see really is the yellow on the graph. And if I do a quick whistle-stop tour around the geographies, what we're seeing, in the Northwest, Washington, Oregon, Portland, around there, highly dominated by tech companies. So what we've seen is a real softening of the tech market and the associated commercial office space with that, not surprising given tech stocks are down and they're starting to lay people off.\nIf I go to Southern California, really robust business and that we're the largest provider of schools. We've recently received 5 school awards. So a really strong business there that keeps turning out schools. And funny enough, some of the schools are over $100 million, which is astonishing in terms of value.\nIn this area, on the civils side, we've got the Los Angeles Airport, where we're doing the people mover and we've got the Caltrain, we're electrifying the train line from San Jose to San Francisco. Two very large contracts, and going well at this moment in time. Caltrain, as I said last time, we've renegotiated the fee from, I think it was about $700 million to about $1 billion.\nIn terms of Texas, what we're seeing in Texas is, Texas is benefiting from really what is a population, because there's a lot of people and corporations moving to Texas. So we haven't seen the downturn in the commercial market. What we've seen is very strong growth, both in commercial office space, hospitals, but also there's a number of banks moving to the area. We've actually got the largest pipeline we've seen in a long time at about $7.5 billion. Our challenge, I think, in Texas is going to be how we actually manage the demand that's coming through in '23 and '24.\nIf I move to the Southeast, this is a $10 billion pipeline of opportunities. And this is largely hospitality, entertainment. I think Disney recently announced with its themes park sort of a record first half of the year. And we're now seeing the projects that they mothballed during COVID now coming back out again. Now these were previously awarded to us and they're looking to actually continue to -- for us to implement. So what we see here is this market is coming back and coming back very strongly.\nAnd then the last area I touch on would be the Mid-Atlantic. And the Mid-Atlantic has -- it does have the developer market, but we've been moving away and reducing our exposure in that area towards federal. And we were hoping to get 1 federal project, we ended up getting 2 major federal projects and over $1 billion of orders.\nThe other thing I would say that's in these numbers as well or in this picture is that we've received our first instruction around military housing to actually do a demolition at Fort Carson of some of the old properties there, which are really beyond maintaining and repair. And that's very encouraging in light of the history with the DoJ. So we are seen to be a valued supplier going forward in the future.\nHong Kong, we don't spend a lot of time in Hong Kong because there's really no change, except this is -- this order book flattered by exchange rate is up by some 20%. We see Hong Kong as being a very robust market going forward with good, reliable, consistent performance. Again, the growth is going to be in the Northern Metropolis, where they're going to be building out more cities.\nMTR in terms of infrastructure is a big customer of ours and some where we want to stay very close to and play with. They've still got their hospital program. We're not a big player in that, although we're trying to participate. But the one thing I would say is that there's a great emphasis and it comes from the recent visit and the 25-year anniversary of Hong Kong on young people and getting them to stay in Hong Kong and ensuring that they've got the right sort of housing and accommodation. So there's a big thrust here around attracting young people, particularly to do start-ups and keep the entrepreneurial spirit. Whether that will be successful or not, I do not know. But this is going to be -- continue to be a strong market for us.\nLet's move to Support Services, where we've announced that we're going to be performing at the upper end of expectations. If I look at rail, road and power for a few seconds, if I add all this up, it's about GBP 1 billion of turnover. So it's -- for us, it's a material business. If I look at the opportunity, if we double that business in terms of percent of market share increase in this opportunity, it wouldn't even be negligible. So there's plenty of growth to be had in this area. The challenge is, is to get the people to actually do -- to capitalize on the growth.\nSo again, we're not constrained in this market by opportunity, we're constrained by capability. If I look at the rail business, really exciting. We are performing very well on CP6 and CP7. Challenging, demanding, but we're actually doing a very, very good job. We are bidding other areas, which potentially, in 2024, could see that business double.\nNow that all -- that depends on awards. But if we were to get another award of another area, it would double our market share. In the meantime, what we're doing is we're looking to drive the business for productivity improvement because if you can't get more people, you've got to become more productive. You've got to use modular manufacturing, you've got to use digitization. So that's where we're driving and we're looking to see increased productivity in this area.\nIn terms of road maintenance, there's a number of local authorities who will be coming out with their road maintenance to tender. This is usually a 5-year contract. We've bid 3 or 4, we've been successful on 1. And in the case of Buckshire -- sorry, Buckinghamshire, it's worth GBP 176 million, which will actually show a 5% approximately growth next year as that contract comes online.\nSo again, a big market here, a lot of opportunity. Also within road maintenance, we have our CPS contract, which is the maintenance of M25. You can't actually change the revenue on that. So what we're doing is we're driving productivity. So in the next time frame, what we're going to see is productivity improvements from the CPS contract and then growth in '23 and beyond in the council road maintenance.\nIn the area of power, I think I've described the offshore and the wind power, the resilience and how robust our network is. This is a highly differentiated offering of ours. We've got tremendous capability. The challenge is it takes 5 years to bring people up to speed in this area. So this is all about how do we drive productivity in order to satisfy the increasing demand. Again, I think it's -- you can comfortably see why we are talking about the upper end of margin expectations.\nWe're often asked a question about our infrastructure investment pipeline as to, is it actually simply a store of value as in a battery? Or is it actually something that can be supercharged in order to drive growth? Well, fundamentally, it's both. If you look at the divestment track record, as Phil has described very ably, we've done extremely well in terms of the divestments themselves, but also exceeding the book value that we have. And I don't see that abating.\nIn terms of the other question, in terms of the growth engine, well, if you look at the U.K. very, very quickly, there hasn't been an effective P3 or PPP market in the U.K. for 10-plus years. And in effect, our only real growth is around student accommodation. We've got 3,500 rooms tied up between the Royal Holloway and the University of Sussex. So they're good projects, and there are other ones in the pipeline. But again, it's not really a dramatic growth market for us.\nHowever, last time I presented, I talked about P3 in the United States. And although it's early at this moment in time, if you just look at all the clutter that's up here, there's an awful lot of things going on and an awful lot of people exploring the opportunity. And interestingly enough, we're starting to engage.\nI talked about schools last time in Prince George's County in Washington, D.C., Virginia -- actually at Maryland, but you're seeing also bridges and roads now coming into play. And with some of our customers, we've been able to sort of combine offerings to say, why don't you put your road and your rail bridge together and start to create some real value? So rather than building 2 separate structures, you can do it on one.\nWe're looking at a lot of civil hall -- civic offices and the like. Student housing is still a big deal. But fundamentally, I see this as a -- over the next 3 to 5 years, a considerable amount of growth will actually come through this channel. And that will then underpin our U.S. construction business. So I'm very optimistic about the strong pipeline and it will emerge over time.\nIn terms of, for us, building new futures, really, really important that we buy into this, not only because the government said so, but this is sort of the right thing to do. And the way I think about it and characterize it, it's a little bit like safety. But we've already laid out our ambitions for 2040, 0 carbon, 0 waste -- beyond 0 carbon, 0 waste and positively impacting 1 million people.\nWe've laid out our science-based targets for 2030. And we've also prepared and are in the process of preparing for submission the waterfalls as to how you're going to do that step by step. And that will be really important. But the real thing that I want people to take away here is, I talk about -- we run a safe company because we design for safety. So we think about it at the front end as we're doing design.\nThe sustainability, decarbonizing whatever is actually the same context. You've got to do it by design, you can't retrofit it. So for example, we have dedicated carbon and energy teams. I think we're one of the few companies in our sector that actually has that. So you hear about the greenwashing, we've really got people whose full-time job is to get this right. And if we actually design for sustainability, impacts such things as water in terms of how do we recycle it and use the minimum amount.\nSo on that tunnel that you saw built at the beginning, that actually uses high-pressure water to cut out the earth. And that is actually recycled and we reuse 70% of that. In the case of mass haul, if you've got your design early, you cut the material ones and you place it where it will rest for the rest of its life. We don't believe in double touching materials.\nSo if we get all these things right, in the same way where we get safety right, we'll end up with a business that actually is at the forefront of decarbonization and achieving our science-based targets will be, I think, fairly comfortable. But very important and a big differentiator for us.\nSo fundamentally, in summary, and the outlook feels giving you every single possible combination of numbers. So even the less (inaudible) can actually work out how bright the future looks. But fundamentally, the first half performance gives us confidence in the full year and that actually underpins our upgrade. Our unique capability, which I've emphasized all the way through this, talks to what is a decade of infrastructure growth. I mean we really couldn't be in a better position than we are in today.\nIn the short term, the way we've moved our order book in terms of the example of federal infrastructure, how those contracts and terms and conditions are put together, leave us with a much more derisked position than we've ever had in the last 6 or 7 years. Our investment portfolio up GBP 200 million. Yes, it's flattened by exchange rate and inflation, but what an asset to actually have, almost equal to the market capitalization if it wasn't for the sharp rise in the share price this morning.\nAnd as Phil has talked to ad nauseam, our capital allocation model gives us confidence that we're going to continue to give future returns back to shareholders underpinned by the cash flow, which I showed you. So net-net, good set of results, optimistic about the future and our positioning in infrastructure, I think, gives us real confidence that this is going to continue for the next few years. Thank you.",

Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 a.m. Eastern time today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMollie O'Brien\n\nVP of IR, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO.\nDuring the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\nSome of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nCEO & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team's strong execution and focus on providing amazing service for our customers. Throughout the quarter, they navigated the uncertain macro environment and drove higher customer satisfaction scores while keeping energy and excitement going around the initiatives that we believe will drive longer-term opportunities.\nWe grew our Totaltech membership, increased momentum in our health business, launched new product categories and reached our fastest ever Q1 average online sales delivery speed. At our investor update in March, we said we expected our fiscal '23 financial results to look different. As we all lap stimulus and other government support, our industry cycles the last 2 years of unusually strong demand, and we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future.\nIn addition, we said we expected promotional activity to increase and supply chain expenses to be a pressure. As such, we guided our annual comparable sales to decline 1% to 4% and our non-GAAP operating income rate to decline 60 basis points to approximately 5.4%. Therefore, the drivers of our Q1 financial results were largely as expected. Macro conditions worsened since we provided our guidance in early March, including higher inflation and the war in Ukraine, which resulted in our sales being slightly lower than our expectations and supply chain costs a little higher than we planned.\nOur investment in Totaltech at approximately 100 basis points of gross margin pressure was in line with our expectations and revenue from our credit card profit share was higher than anticipated. Overall, I am proud of our team's ability to develop and execute plans to adapt to the changing environment over the past 2 years and to the more recent macroeconomic conditions. Our revenue and profitability remained much stronger than they were pre-pandemic.\nQ1 revenue of $10.6 billion is $1.5 billion or 16% higher than Q1 of pre-pandemic fiscal '20. And while our non-GAAP operating income rate is currently being impacted by our investments, it is still 80 basis points higher than fiscal '20, even with those investments and supply chain pressures. Our Enterprise comparable sales declined 8% as we lapped particularly strong comparable sales last year. The 37% comp sales growth in Q1 of last year was driven by the timing of government stimulus payments, lapping a quarter during which our stores were closed early in the pandemic, and the heightened demand for stay-at-home focused purchases.\nFrom a category standpoint, the biggest contributor to the comp sales decline were computing and home theater. Although down from last year's strong sales compared to Q1 of fiscal '20, our computing revenue has grown more than 30%. Our Domestic Appliance business, which has grown every quarter except for 1 for more than 10 years, delivered comparable sales growth of 3% on top of 67% growth last year.\nWe aspire to help customers with all their technology needs in the most seamlessly possible across all touch points, and we are encouraged by the improvements in our customer Net Promoter Scores. We have been leveraging our omnichannel strength to serve and support our customers as their shopping behavior and expectations have evolved significantly over the past 2 years. While customers have returned to physical stores to see and touch products and get advice, our digital engagement with customers remains very high. Our online sales as a percentage of domestic sales are 31%, still twice as high as prepandemic levels. And revenue from virtual phone and chat interactions continues to increase rapidly.\nAdditionally, we are expanding our engagement with customers in their homes as in-home consultations and in-home installations are up significantly. During the quarter, we saw higher NPS overall, and we saw our highest ever NPS from in-store purchases and in-store services. I would like to take a moment to expand on the topic of inflation, important in the current environment. Like other companies, we have seen cost inflation in areas such as labor, marketing and supply chain. However, this cost inflation was largely in line with our expectations and benefited from planning and execution over the previous 2 years.\nAs it relates to product pricing, we have seen an increase in our average selling prices over the past 2 years due to a number of factors. First, our product sales mix has changed as customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. This has been happening for years and accelerated during the pandemic. Additionally, we have driven material growth in appliances, which carry high ASPs and have become a larger part of our mix.\nSecond, there was overall lower promotional and markdown activity during much of the pandemic due to the shortage of product to meet demand. And third, our vendors are absorbing higher transportation and component costs and some of that has led to higher cost of goods sold for us. In many cases, we have passed through this higher cost of goods sold in the form of higher prices to customers.\nImportantly and fundamentally, we aim to be competitive in our pricing. We have seen a pickup in the promotional environment as we have consistently noted, starting in July of last year. As we entered fiscal '23, we expected the promotional environment to create margin pressure in Q1 and throughout the year. In Q1, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. And some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning back to our Q1 results. Our ending inventory was up 9% compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenue since fiscal '20. Our teams did an amazing job actively managing inventory levels as the quarter progressed in this evolving supply and demand environment. Pockets of inventory constraints still exist, but are currently isolated to certain products and vendors.\nOverall, our inventory remains healthy. Even though inventory availability in CE is much better than it has been for much of the pandemic, the supply chain continues to be challenging with ongoing transportation disruptions and higher costs including containers, labor and fuel. We are, of course, not immune to the supply chain challenges in the world today, and we are seeing some impacts on our business. We have invested in many aspects of our supply chain over the last several years in ways that have helped us navigate the environment and mitigate the impacts.\nWe have employed a portfolio approach as it relates to carriers, transportation partners and parcel delivery partners. And we have built deep relationships across our supply chain, including port carriers and deconsolidation operations. In addition, we strategically leveraged the use of both rail and over-the-road transportation modes to move product. All of this has helped us to drive capacity, avoid large-scale disruption and mitigate cost increases.\nImportantly, our contractual relationships have allowed us to limit our exposure to the more turbulent spot market. The strong relationships we have cultivated with our vendors have also been crucial to our navigation of the supply chain environment. Working closely with our vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process.\nAdditionally, we actually handled transportation for many of our vendors, meaning we take control in Asia or Mexico. Then we have full visibility and control of the inventory movement and costs. We have invested in our distribution center network, effectively bringing product closer to customers and implementing technology solutions that increase productivity and speed to customer. We have also invested in our store-based fulfillment, including our ship-from-store customer fulfillment centers, and implemented an effective employee delivery system.\nThese investments have allowed us to make dramatic improvements in speed of delivery to our customers, even with the significant increase in volume in the past 2-plus years. In addition, we have many options for our customers to pick up their products themselves through in-store pickup, curbside pickup, lockers and alternate pickup locations. Customers clearly appreciate the convenience as the percentage of online sales picked up in stores has remained relatively consistent over the past several years at approximately 40%, even with the incredible improvements in shipping time.\nAs it relates to ESG, we remain encouraged by the recent recognition of our work to support the environment and our community, both inside and outside Best Buy. We are proud to be included on Ethisphere's 2022 World's Most Ethical Companies list. We are 1 of only 3 retailers on it and it's our eighth time earning the honor. We were also included on the 2022 Forbes List of Best Employers for Diversity as 1 of the top 4 retailers on the list. It's our third consecutive year making the rankings that recognize leadership and commitment towards building a more inclusive workplace.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded our recycling program to include a new service for customers who are looking for our help recycling their large products. For a fee, we will go to customers' homes to pick up large electronics and appliances as well as an unlimited number of small products and ensure they're responsibly recycled and kept out of landfill. This service is in addition to our everyday recycling programs available at all Best Buy stores and our Holloway service with the purchase of new products.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our employees executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers. Even with the expected slowdown this year as we lap 2-plus years of pandemic impacts, we continue to be in a fundamentally stronger position than we expected to be at this point. We are confident in the strength of our business and excited about what lies ahead.\nWe have a compelling value creation opportunity and are investing now, as we have successfully invested ahead of change in our past, to ensure we're ready to meet the needs of our customers and retain our unique position in our industry. As we provided a more detailed investor update in combination with our Q4 results on March 3, I'm not going to outline all our initiatives, but would like to provide a few updates on our progress.\nIn March, we spoke quite a bit about Totaltech, our unique membership program that includes member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery and installation and 24/7 tech support. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers with complete confidence in their technology. Buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to sign up more members as customers realize the great benefits of the program. And we are encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we continue to see from customers who have signed up to become members. We are pleased with the pace at which we are acquiring new members, especially considering the macro environment. We continue to see that Totaltech has broad appeal across customer segments.\nAdditionally, we are improving our ability to gain members not only in retail stores but in our digital and in-home channel. As a reminder, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer-term benefit. We expect year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate to cease as we lap the launch in October. And over time, we expect the incremental spend we garnered from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. Accordingly, Totaltech is a significant contributor to our fiscal '25 goals.\nAs we outlined in March, we are optimizing our workforce and reimagining our physical presence in ways that serve our customers' needs in our more digital world. We are making investments that provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as the customer moves from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home.\nThis includes our virtual sales strategy. Early in the pandemic, the volume of customers interacting with us via phone and chat skyrocketed. The volume has remained high, and we are actively working to increase the sales opportunity of these interactions through a number of efforts. One, we are leveraging a team of expert sales associates working from their homes, many of whom have in-depth store experience and are certified in multiple categories. Two, we have staffed our virtual store with dedicated experts who can help you via video and demo a product just like they would in our store. And three, we are enhancing the training for our offshore call center agents to help them feel like confident salespeople.\nWe are already seeing great results as revenue from these interactions more than doubled in Q1 compared to last year. Enhancements to our technology platforms are in progress to further streamline our operations and enable these employees to chat, video, text, share their screens and transact. With this, we will be able to accelerate the productivity and sales opportunity further.\nWe have spoken quite a bit about our consultation service that provides customers with expert help and inspiration tailored to their unique tech needs often right in their homes. This is growing and important as we continue to see very high customer satisfaction scores and increasing spend by customers who engage with the consultants. We also have a team that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries, including homebuilding, hospitality and health care. We have been growing this aspect of our business for several years and more recent investments in our digital capabilities and fulfillment have led to strong growth momentum that we expect will continue.\nFor example, Q1 revenue from this team was up 15% over last year's Q1 and up more than 70% from Q1 of fiscal '20. As I step back to comment on our overall workforce, we have been actively evolving the composition of our teams throughout the last 2 years as customer behavior changed and became even more digitally focused. The result is that our overall head count is actually lower than pre-pandemic. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interaction. We will continue to learn, evaluate and evolve the model in light of the way the business and shopping habits are changing.\nAt the same time, we have invested and will continue to invest in flexibility, training, compensation and benefits for our associates. We are incredibly proud that our field turnover rates remain significantly below the retail average and are near our prepandemic turnover rates. Additionally, our store general manager turnover is just 6%, meaning our GMs have the tenure and experience to effectively help their teams navigate this dynamic environment. It is clear that we have store managers who are invested in their employees, their career paths, their well-being and their communities, and I thank them for their dedication.\nOf course, as previously noted, we are also reimagining our physical stores. This year, we expect to complete approximately 45 remodels to implement our experience store concept. We are excited about these remodels as we continue to see higher revenue and NPS in the pilot locations compared to the controlled stores, especially as one of the pilots has been running almost 2 years. We also continue to see strong results from our outlet stores and are on track to roll out more this year with new stores opening soon in Chicago, Houston and Phoenix.\nOur outlet stores assort open box, clearance, end-of-life and otherwise distressed large product inventory in major appliances and televisions that might otherwise be liquidated at significantly lower recovery rate. We tend to see twice the recovery rate of our cost of goods sold when we sell this product at our outlets versus alternative channels. Additionally, these locations can attract new and reengaged customers.\nLast year, we estimated that approximately 16% of outlet customers were new to Best Buy and 37% were reengaged Best Buy customers. In fiscal '23, we plan to double the number of outlets by opening 15 additional stores, and we are expanding our assortment beyond major appliances and large TVs to include computing, gaming and mobile phones. We are already seeing increased performance in these new outlet formats as customers gravitate to the expanded assortment.\nFinally, these outlet stores are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in a landfill. And another important element of this circular economy strategy is our trade-in program. We have an extensive trade-in program covering more major CE categories than anyone else. In Q1, we took in 135,000 trade-in units from customers. Not only does our trade-in program keep tech products out of landfills, our customers typically spend 3x the amount they received on their trade-in on new products at Best Buy.\nWe are continuing our category expansion strategy as well. For example, we're helping customers commute more sustainably with a new lineup of the best electric bikes, scooters and mopeds. Over the next 18 months, we'll be bringing up selection of these products to nearly every Best Buy store. We're also rolling out charging devices, perfect for our customers' garages in several stores. And Geek Squad cannot only assemble the e-bikes for customers, but we're also beginning a pilot to test service and repair for e-transportation products in some of our stores.\nWe also just recently announced further expansion into the health and beauty category by launching new skincare technology products online and in 300 of our stores. In our Best Buy Health business, we are pleased with our first quarter momentum. In Q1, we saw strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home.\nIn our Emerging virtual care business, we connect patients with their physicians to enable care at home. Last November, we acquired Current Health, a technology company with an FDA-cleared monitoring platform for care at home to help us accelerate our strategy. The combination of Current Health offerings and our scale, presence and Geek Squad in-home capabilities is already resonating with the healthcare industry. Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking quarter ever, including expansion of its relationships with health systems such as Mount Sinai Health System, Parkland Health, as well as the U.K. National Health Service and others.\nI'm excited to share that Current Health was awarded best hospital technology implementation in the 2022 MedTech Breakthrough Awards program for its role in supporting health systems across the U.S. implement innovative care at home programs. Current Health was also selected by Frost & Sullivan as the 2022 Company of the Year in the global virtual home care platform industry.\nIn summary, I am proud of how much we accomplished in the first quarter and excited about what lies ahead for us. Clearly, there remains a great deal of uncertainty. On one hand, consumers still have relatively strong balance sheet, they continue to spend, wages are up and unemployment is at record lows. On the other hand, many consumers are lapping stimulus income they received last year and are also facing issues like higher gas and food prices, rising interest and mortgage rates, recession fears, stock market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine.\nUnderlying all that is the gradual shifting of spend from stay-at-home purchases to more experiential spend on services and the activities, many were unable to enjoy during the pandemic. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, while the drivers of our results were largely as expected, the comparable sales decline of 8% was on the softer side as inflationary pressures heightened throughout the quarter. That trend has continued into the beginning of Q2, and it does not appear that it will abate in the near term.\nTherefore, as Matt will outline, we are revising our guidance and now expect fiscal '23 comparable sales decline in the range of 3% to 6%. And we are correspondingly updating our non-GAAP operating income rate to a range of 5.2% to 5.4%. We will continue to proactively navigate this rapidly changing environment, balancing the day-to-day operations with our commitment to our long-term strategy and growth initiatives.\nBefore I turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 and our outlook, I want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers in all our channels. I greatly appreciate your teamwork and perseverance. I love the Best Buy culture and our commitment to enriching lives through technology. And I will close by saying this. We firmly believe that technology is more relevant today than ever. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology, and we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers' homes right for their lives. From our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn't working the way you want or traded in recycling when you want to upgrade. We believe we have an ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can.\nAnd with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. As Corie mentioned, we expected our Q1 financial results to be softer on a year-over-year basis. .\nOur Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 8% on a comparable basis as we lapped a very strong 37% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.6% compared to 6.4% last year. If you compare it to the first quarter of fiscal '20, before the pandemic, our non-GAAP operating income rate increased 80 basis points. Our revenue growth has clearly played a role in our improved SG&A rate, but I would also like to highlight a few other factors. Our investment in Totaltech membership alone added more than 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to the fiscal '20 period.\nWe are also investing in Best Buy Health. These are both areas that we know create near-term pressure, but we believe they will drive compelling financial returns over time as they scale. I also want to note that since fiscal '20, our mix of revenue from our online channel has more than doubled, and we have efficiently evolved our operating model to support this shift in consumer shopping behavior, while at the same time, navigating higher wages and increase supply chain and technology costs.\nLet me now share more details on the first quarter performance versus last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased to 8.7% from $9.9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 8.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, as expected, the largest comparable sales decline was the 5-week fiscal March period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater. In addition, services comparable sales declined 12% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services such as warranty and installation.\nIn our International segment, revenue decreased 5.4% to $753 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of $19 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 1.4% in Canada. Turning now to gross profit, where our enterprise rate declined 120 basis points, 22.1%. The domestic gross profit rate declined 140 basis points, which was primarily driven by lower services margin rates, including pressure associated with Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates, which included increased promotional activity and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue in the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement.\nLastly, our International non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 130 basis points compared to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our Enterprise results. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. On a weighted basis, the services category negatively impacted the Domestic gross profit rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year, which largely aligned with our expectations entering the quarter.\nMoving next to SG&A. Our Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $100 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of $130 million, which included lapping $40 million for onetime gratitude and appreciation awards last year. Partially offsetting the lower incentive compensation were increased expenses for advertising and our health initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we returned a total of $654 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $455 million and dividends of $199 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.88 was an increase of 26% and marked the eighth straight year of regular dividend increased at least 10% compared to the prior year. Consistent with our original guidance, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases this year.\nLet me next share more color on our guidance for the full year. Many of the key assumptions driving our outlook from when we enter the year remain unchanged. We still expect the first half of the year to be more pressured on a year-over-year basis for both revenue growth and our non-GAAP operating income rate. In addition, we still expect the non-GAAP operating income rate decline to be primarily come from lower gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the key driver.\nLet me next share some context on what has changed in our outlook. Entering the year, we were cognizant of lapping the large levels of government stimulus actions last year. As we already shared, sales came in a little lower than our expectations for the first quarter, and this trend has continued into the second quarter. It is difficult to assess how much of the decline may be longer tail associated with elevated stimulus spending last year or overall consumer spending slowing down due to inflationary concerns and the shift of consumer spending to experiences.\nBased on the trends we are seeing over the past several weeks, we now feel it's more likely that we will be on the lower end of our original guidance expectations. As a result, we now expect comparable sales to decline 3% to 6%. As Corie discussed, clearly, there is still a lot of uncertainty in macro cross currents. Thus, we will continue to assess the sales trends, adjusting for our spend for variable items like advertising and store labor, as well as discretionary areas as appropriate. We also expect favorable trends in our private label credit card arrangement to partially offset higher costs in areas like supply chain for the remainder of the year.\nAt the same time, we remain committed to progressing the initiatives, we are confident will deliver compelling financial returns in the future. As a result of the lower sales outlook, our non-GAAP operating income rate outlook is now 5.2% to 5.4%. Based on these factors, I've just outlined, our guidance for the full year now represents the following: Enterprise revenue of $48.3 billion to $49.9 billion, a comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.2% to 5.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.40 to $9.\nWe expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. And lastly, we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.\nAs we shared on our last earnings call, we no longer plan to provide quarterly guidance going forward. However, we'd like to provide context on our expectations. Several of the key themes from the first quarter are expected to be consistent in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales and the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will both be very similar to our first quarter results.\nAlso, as a reminder, last year's second quarter included a onetime diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.47 from a lower effective tax rate. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our 2021 Full Year Results. Before we start this morning, I'd like to introduce Charles Allen, our new Chairman. And Charles would just like to say a few words of introduction before we commence the presentation. So Charles, the floor is yours.\n\nCharles Allen\n\nYes, thanks very much. And good morning, everyone. Leo has very kindly agreed to be my simultaneous translator if you actually understand my Scottish accent, so there'll be subtitles here. Leo, thank you. I've been with the company 8 months. It's been a great 8 months. I've had a chance to visit 25 of our projects around the country. And I never fail to be impressed by the quality of people that I meet and the complexity of the projects that they may look -- they make look easy.\nI'm only frustrated having worked in different sectors, companies like ISS, it does facility management making 4% to 6%, with all the complexity we have, we make 2%. So big challenge is how do we make it more? And I know Leo has been turning the company around with Phil and the rest of the Board, there's a fantastic opportunity to do more and more and more.\nAnd that's what I keep saying to Leo every Board meeting more and more and more profit that is. So basically, thank you very much for coming along today. The other bit of good news you may have seen is one of the things on my agenda was strengthening the Board from a D&I perspective. And I'm delighted to say we're bringing on Board, Louise Hardy, who is a civil engineer.\nShe's been around the sector for a while. She worked on the Olympics. She worked in London Underground. She worked with Bechtel. So a wide range of experience, and I'm delighted to get some of her caliber joining our Board. And that's great news because I think it sends a very strong message externally, but probably more importantly, internally to the ladies we have around the business to say, you can do this and really drive that D&I agenda. It's very important to me. It's something I've been involved with for 30-odd years. So particularly pleased with that.\nHopefully, you'll agree that we've got a very solid set of results today, and that allows us to move into this year with real confidence. Thank you and enjoy the meeting. Thank you.\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThank you, Charles. And in the spirit of inclusiveness and diversity, we went out of our way to ensure that when we chose the Chairman, we didn't pick a toll Chairman because we can't have 2 of us. So there we are. Anyway, thank you very much, Charles, and very welcome to the company. Great addition to the team.\nToday, we're going to look at the results for 2021. I want to draw your attention to this photograph here for a few seconds. This is truly something which is quite spectacular. It's the inside of the channel tunnel. And up on the top left, what you can actually see is a connector cable connecting the French National Grid to the U.K. National Grid, carries 1 gigawatt of power and effectively serves 1.6 million homes bidirectional either way. That's the kind of project that we take on and we do.\nHistorically, we took this on at a fixed price lump sum. It did deliver profitably. In future, we'll be taking it on a cost-plus basis, but a fantastic project and a real feat of engineering. So today, the results, 2021's performance: an excellent year, ahead of expectations and more importantly, ahead of 2019, which is pre-COVID period.\nOver the last few years, we've actually transformed Balfour Beatty into what really is a resilient, diversified group, both geographically and the businesses that we actually entertain in the business models within that, also the markets that we serve.\nAs we leave 2021, we go into '22 with a very high-quality order book with real clear visibility of the future. And the mix of that business allows us to actually predict and forecast very accurately. So we're pretty confident in our 2022 forecasted expectations. If I think about the markets that we serve, we are largely dominated by the infrastructure market. And we're going into, and I'll show you later in my presentation, almost what I think is going to be a decade of infrastructure growth, which matches absolutely perfectly with the capability that we have within the company.\nWe also have, underpinning our balance sheet and also underpinning our share buyback, our investment portfolio, which is a GBP 1.1 billion asset. And not only is that an opportunity for us to actually put our negative working capital to work, we've got a very attractive growth portfolio both in the U.K. and the U.S. that we're actually pursuing.\nAll of these things give me great confidence in that we'll deliver future profitable managed growth, and that underpins the fact that we've increased our share buyback from GBP 100 million to GBP 150 million this year. It's not only the markets that we're in, which are really encouraging, but it's actually the platform that we've put in place. When we started Build to Last all those years ago, we talked about creating a foundation for the next 100 years.\nWell, this is the foundation we've created. And if you think about it, what gets measured gets done. And the things we've got up here are important to us. If I'm looking at U.K. voluntary attrition, prior to 2020, we were down at single digits in the high 9%s. You can see that post 2019, we're now up at 14%. And what you've seen as a result of COVID is people have a change in lifestyle. They've decided where they want to work, where they want to spend their time. And so we've seen some attrition there. We've also seen with the group's capability that there's been a high degree of people attracting people away from Balfour Beatty, sometimes on some ludicrously high packages and the likes of that, which really testament to the way that we train and develop our people.\nBut we've seen attrition rise to about 14%, and that's one of our biggest worries. Interesting enough, that's despite the fact we've had our highest ever employee satisfaction scores at 76%. And also the question we ask is, do you see yourself being with Balfour Beatty in 12 months' time? We've had an 86% response rate who says they do.\nSo you can see that this is an area we take very, very seriously because at the end, we are a people business. The other areas that we'd actually look at and manage very carefully is obviously earnings. And you can see between '14 to '19, which is pre-COVID in '21, we've gone from a loss of GBP 144 million to a profit of GBP 181 million, the GBP 181 million beating the pre-COVID levels.\nWe put in place an operating platform where effectively that serves the company well. And you can see the overhead costs in the business have halved in the last 7 years, and they're down over 2019. That reduction is actually largely due to subsistence and travel and things like that.\nSo we will see GBP 226 million rising in the next 12 months, although our goal is to really try to keep it to that level. And then finally, an astonishing statistic, if you actually look at the average net cash or debt between 2014 and 2021, that's a -- over GBP 1 billion of free cash flow generated from the business, which is a great achievement.\nIf you think about our Build to Last program, it's really gone through 3 phases. The first phase, if you remember, was actually self-help. We didn't go out to the shareholders for equity, we used our balance sheet and the asset on the balance sheet in order to fund the turnaround.\nThe second phase, which was 2017 to 2019 was we actually used surplus cash to actually pay down scheduled debt. And then the third phase, which we're in now, last year and now this year, we've announced the program of share buyback, GBP 150 million last year, GBP 150 million this year on top of the ordinary dividend. And this has actually demonstrated very well in this graph.\nHere's our self-help period. Here's the period of strengthening the balance sheet and paying down debt. Just under GBP 0.5 billion of cash was put into that. And now here we are returning cash to shareholders some GBP 366 million announced in the program. So if you think about our lean, expert, trusted and safe, this is an example of trusted to do what we say we will do in terms of delivering returns to shareholders. So very confident about the future.\nAnd on that note, I'll hand over to Phil.\n\nPhilip J. Harrison\n\nCFO & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nThanks, Leo. Good morning, everybody. Let's get rid of some of these. Let's go to the headline numbers. In 2021, the total underlying profit from operations for the year at GBP 197 million shows a significant improvement from 2020, as Balfour Beatty continued to recover from the pandemic, including recommencing investment asset disposals. We reported profit from operations from the earnings-based businesses of GBP 181 million, a strong rebound from 2020 and ahead of our expectations to be in line with our 2019 pre-pandemic profit of GBP 172 million.\nEarnings per share in the period of 29.7p is significantly ahead of 2020 and more importantly, 11% ahead of our 2019 results. Both average net cash and year-end net cash increased as positive operating cash flows and significant working capital inflows more than offset the first year of our multiyear share buyback program. Average net cash at GBP 671 million and a year-end net cash of GBP 790 million underpins the group's competitive advantage and supports our long-term capital allocation framework.\nAt the year-end, Balfour Beatty's order book at GBP 16.1 billion and the Director's valuation at GBP 1.1 billion were both broadly flat with the 2020 year-end. Given these results, the Board today is recommending a final dividend of 6p per share, giving a total recommended dividend for the year of 9p per share. The group is also announcing today a GBP 150 million share buyback for 2022 as the next phase of its multiyear program. The buyback will commence immediately and is expected to complete during 2022.\nGoing into the numbers in more detail and turning to Construction Services. The business recorded an underlying profit of GBP 79 million for the year from continued strong performance at Gammon with GBP 30 million of profit. U.S. Construction, broadly doubling its profit to GBP 51 million as we returned to pre-pandemic levels; and U.K. Construction recording a GBP 2 million loss from operations in the year.\nThe U.K. result was negatively impacted by performance issues at 3 private residential projects in Central London. One of these projects was completed in 2020 -- November '21 with the 2 remaining projects expected to complete in 2022.\nElsewhere, key U.K. infrastructure projects such as HS2, Hinkley, and Highways continue to perform well, in line with our focus on key infrastructure projects, over 90% of U.K. Construction revenue was from public sector and regulated industry clients in the year. Importantly, in the second half of the year, U.K. Construction recorded an underlying profit of GBP 21 million at a 1.6% margin. Looking ahead, Balfour Beatty continues to be focused on public sector infrastructure and will no longer bid for fixed-price residential property projects in Central London.\nNow turning to Support Services. After several years of reapings (technical difficulty) underpinned by long-term contracts. We saw a significant outperformance in 2021, as profit from operations more than doubled to GBP 102 million as a result of improved performance across the portfolio, the group's exit from gas and water and end of contract gains, one of them being the channel tunnel picture that you saw earlier in Leo's presentation.\nThis represents the repositioning of Support Services has driven us to set a new margin target range for the business at 6% to 8%, upgraded from our prior range of 3% to 5%. Specifically for 2022, we expect revenue to be around GBP 900 million following the completion of the gas and water contracts, with the group targeting our new margin range.\nTurning to Infrastructure Investments. Pre-disposal operating profit in the year increased to GBP 14 million, broadly consistent with the pre-pandemic level. More importantly, in June 2021, the group recommenced asset disposals with the sale of its stake in the children and women's hospital in Canada for the cash consideration of GBP 20 million.\nIn the second half of the year, we sold a bundle of U.K. assets for GBP 48 million and 2 U.S. multifamily housing projects for GBP 12 million. All transactions were above the directors' valuation, demonstrating strength of the secondary market for infrastructure assets.\nThe business continues its disciplined approach to target a 2x return on its invested capital as we continue to see good market opportunities. During the year, the group invested GBP 19 million in new or existing projects. The 4 new assets comprised 2 student accommodation projects, the Vanderbilt University in the U.S. and Royal Holloway in the U.K. and 2 U.S. multifamily housing projects in Houston, Texas, and San Mateo, Florida.\nMoving to nonunderlying items. This year, there are 2 items that we're mentioning, given the overall GBP 55 million net charge after taxation. Firstly, in December 2021, Balfour Beatty communities reached a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice, which brought to a close the DoJ's criminal and civil investigations into work order incentives.\nCommunity paid a total resolution amount of $65 million in January 2022. Net of tax and previous provisions, we have recognized GBP 37 million in our 2021 accounts. Secondly, at half year, the group disclosed a contingent liability for potential rectification works on our developments in London. At year-end, it has been determined that remediation will require replacement of the stone facade. We have taken a GBP 34 million charge net of tax as this is our current best estimate for the remediation. The provision does not include any potential recoveries from third parties.\nNow if we move to cash flow. Another year of positive cash flow in which we generate an inflow of GBP 209 million, increasing the group's net cash position to GBP 790 million. The strong performance was driven by operating cash flows and working capital inflows. The most significant movement in the year was working capital inflows with the following key factors increasing contract assets: GBP 110 million of advanced payments from major projects in U.K. Construction, GBP 30 million of advanced payments at Highways projects in the U.S. and net contract inflows of around GBP 30 million from our closeout of gas and water contracts as we exit from that sector.\nIn addition, trade payables increased GBP 43 million following the introduction of the U.K. VAT domestic reverse charge for the construction sector and the cost of settlement relating to the DoJ resolution, which was, as I said earlier, paid in January 2022. These items were partially offset by the timing of trade creditor payments.\nLooking ahead, some of this working capital benefit will unwind in the current year, as we expect a small working capital outflow with a more material outflow in 2023. The group expects negative working capital as a percentage of revenue to normalize between 11% to 13% in the medium term. It is over 15% at full year. With the range movement depending on contract mix and the timing of project starts and completions.\nTurning to our multiyear capital allocation framework that we launched during 2021. To recap on the main points: our focus is to continue to organically invest in the business where those investments can meet our group hurdle rates, continue to realize strong cash returns from asset disposals, maintain a strong but efficient balance sheet and that gives us competitive advantage and deliver a sustainable dividend and additional cash returns to shareholders.\nSo now turning to how the capital allocation framework translates into shareholder returns. The next side here it summarizes our current position. For 2022, the group expects its earnings base businesses to deliver further profit growth in line with the Board's expectations. Whilst the infrastructure investments, the group will continue to diverse the assets and make new investments in line with its capital allocation framework. For 2023 and beyond, the strength of the group's order book and positive infrastructure markets create the visibility to deliver profitable managed growth and sustainable cash generation.\nIn March 2021, the Board reintroduced the dividend at a targeted payout ratio of 40% of underlying profit after tax, excluding gains from investment disposals. The Board has declared a full year 9p dividend for 2021, higher than any point under Build to Last.\nFinally, Balfour Beatty's GBP 150 million share buyback program for 2021 completed during the year. And today, we announced that we will buy back a further GBP 150 million in 2022. This will bring our total shareholder returns announced since the start of 2021 to GBP 367 million. And further forward, with its transformed portfolio, the group is confident of delivering significant future shareholder returns in line with its multiyear capital allocation framework.\nThank you. I'll now hand you back to Leo.\n\nLeo M. Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive & Executive Director, Balfour Beatty plc\n\nPerfect. Great. Thanks, Phil. Now let me explain why Phil is confident. First and foremost, we have a geographically and operationally diverse group. We put this in place over the last 7 years. We have 2 distinct parts. We've got our operating businesses and our earnings-based income, and we've got our investment portfolio.\nWhy do they sit together so comfortably? Well, the negative cash flow or negative working capital in our operating business funds effectively the investment portfolio and allows us to invest. We're based uniquely in Hong Kong, U.K. and the U.S.A. And anything outside of that is peripheral. The -- we're based in Construction Services, Support Services. And those are the 2 primary businesses that generate most of our returns.\nIn the Investment business, we split roughly 50-50 U.K. U.S. And again, this underpins our balance sheet to the tune of GBP 1.1 million. And also, the sale of assets will underpin our return of capital to shareholders. So this is a good starting point.\nThe 1 elephant in the room at the moment that's facing the whole industry is that of inflation. And I think it's worth putting this upfront, and then I'll show you our exposure in terms of our contractual mix in respect of that. But again, we've got 2 worlds here. We've got the Construction Services and Support Services and we've got the Investments.\nIn terms of Construction Services, we do have quite a lot of contractual protection and that is where the supply and the sourcing of the material is actually the customer's liability, and basically, it's a pass-through on cost. We also have protections within this in terms of indexing whereby there's an adjustment to an index, which actually will then allow an inflation cost to come into the P&L. But with all of these things, it's never full proof and there's also a timing lag. So the real trick here is to get on to it early and make sure you're managing it proactively.\nOther things that we do in terms of protecting against inflation is buying out early, particularly in our U.S. business and our Buildings business, which is about GBP 4 billion of revenue. And when I say buy out early, what we do is we get awarded the contract and then historically, between 90 and 180 days, we had placed all the subcontracts in order to buy out the job and put the risk down to the supply chain.\nTwo months ago, we reduced that to 90 days. And now what we're doing is buying out 85% of the job in effectively 30 days. You have to remember that sounds great, and you've passed on the liability. But even when you've passed on the liability, if your subcontractor chain or part of it goes bankrupt, it's your liability.\nSo you have a responsibility to effectively actively manage your supply chain. And what we are seeing with the hyperinflation in oil and some materials is that it's beyond any organization to absorb that, even large FTSE 100 companies. And so what we're doing is working proactively and responsibly with the supply chain to ensure that, that is understood by the customer and that it is resolved with the customer.\nIf you look at the thin margins we make, we don't really have the scope to absorb those sorts of deviations. So in effect, it really is about ensuring that the supply chain stays whole and that we're actually managing it with the client and getting them to understand what the risks are because you can't afford for your supply chain to fail, otherwise, your project doesn't go ahead.\nIn terms of our investment portfolio. Some clouds do have a silver lining. And in terms of investments, a lot of our assets, the majority are actually index-linked. And in the case of the U.S. and U.S. multifamily housing, it's actually linked to rate -- the inflation increases in the rent of the properties.\nSo all in all, I think we're quite well positioned, but this is a very live situation and it's something that has to be managed on a day-to-day basis. This actually shows you our contractual exposure. If you look back to 2018, the way we've actually transformed the group, apart from actually doubling the backlog or the order book, 50% of our portfolio is exposed to sort of fixed price lump sum in one form or another. Today, that's 14%. So the best protection you can actually have is to have a very limited exposure to that type of work. And you can see how dramatically it is reduced. And this is important in giving us confidence in that we know that we can forecast how the business is going to perform in the future.\nMoving on and looking at the businesses and again, why Phil would be confident is that we've got a very, very strong backlog at the moment. It's dominated by projects such as HS2 and Hinkley Point C and they will actually be growing over the course of the next 2 to 3 years, but particularly in '22 and '23. Our Highways business has performed exceedingly well over the last 3 or 4 years. For those of you who use the M4, the works are coming to an end in April, so you'll be able to get free passage there. What we are seeing is with the delay in smart motorways is that this business will actually start to decline next year. But the growth that we're going to see in terms of major projects, Old Oak Common and Area North, will actually more than absorb the skills and the capability there.\nThere will be ancillary works that will go on, but not of this type of major infrastructure that we've done with the M4. In terms of our regional business, we're largely working within framework agreements. And again, we're seeing strong backlog and strong growth in our frameworks for the coming years.\nThis is what makes me excited. This is actually the future pipeline that we're working and bidding at this moment in time. So again, HS2 has the track slab, the catenary, it has the extension up to Crewe and then up to Manchester. We're actively engaged in looking to win all of that work, and we're very well positioned with the work that we're doing in Birmingham, but also we've got a very high performance team on HS2. In terms of nuclear and defense, there is the civil nuclear and there is actually the defense nuclear. Both of them are actually huge. Six months ago, a question mark whether Sizewell will actually go ahead Sizewell C. When you think about energy security now and the situation that's going on in the world, it's undoubted in my mind that, that will proceed at pace.\nAnd also in the nuclear defense, there's a GBP 6 billion to GBP 8 billion budget that will be spent over the next 10 years in that area as well. And we are central to all of those conversations at this time. Decarbonization is a new area we're looking to move into as we clean up the industrial Teesside and Humberside, we were down selected as 1 of 2 to deliver to BP, a new carbon capture scheme off the Teesside.\nThis, again, is the exciting area. It's a new area. We're working with Technip in our consortium. And we've got some very good solutions being put forward at this time. And then last year, Lower Thames Crossing a major highway for us, worth probably GBP 2 billion was delayed. It will be coming out in the next few months. But again, another big growth prospect here.\nIf all of these were to happen, my prediction is the industry doesn't have the capacity to actually deliver them. So this is going to be an interesting challenge for the next few years for the whole industry. What's also interesting, along our capabilities in these areas, all of our specialist businesses, whether it be temporary works, design and planning; whether it be ground engineering and piling; whether it be a big civil engineering, earthmoving, mechanical, electrical, power transmission, all of these specialist businesses will benefit in these particular projects. So we're actually not only are we doing the headline project, but all these businesses will be pulling through a lot of business on the back of that. So a very encouraging picture all around.\nIf I look at Support Services, I just love this business because whereas we're forecasting 6% to 8%, it does have the potential to go way beyond that. And the reason is, is that our capability in these areas are so unique, and we do such a good job. In the area of power, we are currently putting in the transmission on the T-pylons from Hinkley Point C through to the Grid. We're up in Scotland connecting to the grid via the Inveraray project. The skills and the capability in this area is really, really unique. And at this moment in time, there's 2 big factors coming into play. If you look down the East Coast and we look Green Wind farms and how they connect to the Grid, that's worth a few billion pounds in terms of onshore transmission.\nIf you look at National Grid's Shareholder Investor Day, you'll see that they're actually forecasting that their CapEx is going to move from GBP 1 billion a year to GBP 2 billion a year in the next 5 years and a lot of that work is going to ultimately end up being dependent on the capability in this business.\nSo we see strong growth and much better returns than we've had in the past here. In terms of our road maintenance, we have 2 constituent parts here. We have the M25 concession. And then we have our living places, which is local authority roads. We've been driving the M25 contract for productivity, improving the systems, the processes and effectively the output of profit and cash. And that's produced a strong performance. In the local authority area, we've delivered a consistent return. And now we've just hit a point where these contracts with the local authorities after 5 and 10 years are now coming out to bid. And we've been down-selected or shortlisted for Buckinghamshire and Northampton. So -- and we're quite encouraged by that. And if we win one of those, it will be a material growth in that business.\nIn terms of the rail maintenance business, London Underground, unfortunately, doesn't really have a very big budget even for maintenance these days. And so this business is going to reduce by 25% to 30% this year. It's relatively small in the scale of this portfolio.\nHowever, we're fantastically well positioned in terms of the Central Rail System Alliance. And we made this decision 3 years ago that we're going to move all our resources on to maintenance. And what's happened in the last 3 years, all the capital projects have actually slowed and stopped and all the money has gone into maintenance. So we found ourselves very, very well positioned, and this business is growing for us.\nThe growth here in the next few years is going to be where the existing rail network starts to interface with HS2. And there's a lot of work that's going to come out through that in terms of connecting the 2 systems together. And again, we're very well placed to capitalize on that. So this Support Services business is not only going to hit the 6% to 8% margin, it's also going to start showing some growth '22 and beyond.\nIf I look at U.S. Construction. Again, a tale of sort of 2 cities here. Our Buildings business is performing very, very strong. We're seeing really good recoveries post the pandemic, particularly in the areas of entertainment, airports and leisure. The -- we're also seeing that our branches are based in the Southern Smile. When you look at all of the surveys, 8 out of the 10 top growth cities in the United States are in the areas that we actually serve. So geographically, we're very well positioned. We continue to deliver on the Broward County project. Broward County is actually also associated with a PPP, which we're actively pursuing at the moment, which is in the tune of about $1 billion and it's the municipal offices, which is colocated with this site. So we're very encouraged about the progress that we're making there.\nIn terms of the Microsoft campus, that's proceeding at pace. There is a particular challenge at the moment with the Teamsters, and they've been on strike for 8 weeks. And there's been no concrete deliveries in Seattle, but that will resolve itself with the passage of time.\nThe other encouraging thing we've seen here and we just had a recent win for just under $1 billion is with the federal market. Under the Biden infrastructure spend, Federal is now becoming an area that's becoming heavily invested. And we've actually just been selected -- on a major project in Washington, D.C., which is very, very encouraging for us.\nAnd again, education is a big area for us, and we see the P3 market in America sort of developing that area over the next few years. In the area of civils, we're doing some major projects, the IH-635 in Texas, Caltrain in Southern -- in California. Caltrain recently has just gone through a renegotiation for us, where we've achieved a 2-year extension on the electrification of that railway and a GBP 349 million change order for the change in scope. We've got enough backlog for the next 2.5 years in this business. And our concentration here is really around delivering that profitably while we work out how we've repositioned ourselves to a profitable niche in this business.\nWe've already down-focused our selection or down-focused in areas of the Carolinas and Texas. So those are the 2 areas that we deliver roads. We're delivering infrastructure at the LAX Airport and Caltrain in San Francisco. As we deliver those over the next 2 years, what we will be looking at is what are the profitable niches that we're prepared to risk our capital in the future as we go forward.\nIf I look at Hong Kong, first thing is, we've got a new CEO in charge of Hong Kong. That's Kevin O'Brien. Kevin was a Balfour Beatty employee, 20 years ago went to Hong Kong. The last 3 years, he's been the CEO of 1 of Jardine's businesses. This is -- Gammon is a joint venture between Balfour Beatty and Jardine's, very experienced operator, both in terms of civil and mechanical and electrical. So a good leader and a good addition to the team. We have a strong order book here, about GBP 2.6 billion. All these numbers, by the way, relate to Balfour Beatty share in pounds.\nSo it's split 50-50 between civils and buildings. We've seen in the last couple of years an advance of infrastructure. So that started to come through to the fore. We've got tremendous credentials. Here we've delivered -- these are some of the sort of the marquee projects.\nThe Central Kowloon Route, which is a road tunnel connecting East and West Kowloon. We've got the Advanced Manufacturing Center, which is designed to service high-tech innovative start-up companies, and we've just completed the M+ Museum building and the Lyric Theatre, which is really the cultural district of Hong Kong.\nThe portfolio at this moment in time is dominated by the airport, over GBP 2 billion worth of business, where we're providing the baggage handling, the people carrier and also the rebuilding of Terminal 2 and the extension of that. A big contract, very, very complex, but very well managed by the team, and we've worked for the airport for 20-odd years. So a very good customer.\nHong Kong has been a consistent performer, delivering a dividend of between GBP 25 million and GBP 35 million a year to the portfolio. So you can see it's very attractive. If this isn't attractive enough, when you look at the future and where you're going to see the investment, if you look at the proposed land development, these blue circles and the numbers inside represent the amount of hectares urbanization that's actually going to go on.\nSo here, you have Hong Kong Island down here. This is the Northern territory. So you can actually start to see the amount of investment that's going to go into reurbanizing those particular areas. On the left-hand side, what you've got here is the mass transit MTR network. And you can see the existing yellow rail lines and then the proposed lines.\nThese are tunnels and railways. And again, this is a major infrastructure investment. So if you look to Hong Kong for the next 10 years, you're going to see a very interesting growth economy. And it is interesting, since the Chinese have taken more of a role in Hong Kong, these projects are coming to market much, much faster. So there are some positives that we see associated with that.\nLooking at our investment portfolio. Again, we've got a new CEO in charge of our investment portfolio, that's Gavin Russell. Gavin is 8 years with Balfour Beatty. He used to be the Group Controller. The last 2 years, he is the Finance Director for the Investments business, and we've now moved him in as the CEO of the business.\nBrings great intellect, energy and has already started very, very fast. The unique characteristic about this business is we've got under 1 roof the project financing expertise, we've got the management of the operational asset and also the construction capability. All of that allows us to actually manage and understand risk.\nAnd the idea that we can operate and maintain these assets means we can hold them until such time that we feel we've got the maximum. This portfolio is a natural home for the negative working capital that we carry on the balance sheet. Some exciting growth things that are going on in the U.K. at this moment in time, just circa 3,000 student accommodation rooms that we're building and commencing to build, that was run over the next 4 years.\nThat's the University of Sussex and Royal Holloway. And we've got the P3 that's going on in Los Angeles Airport at this moment in time. If you ever go through the airport, it's transformational, the rate and the speed at which this is going up. This will be completed in the first quarter of 2024, a stunning project.\nAs I said, it's a high ROI business for us, great home for negative working capital. Portfolio is positively correlated with inflation. So we have inflation indexes within the contracts and on the revenue. And again, as I said, the disposal underpins our share buyback program. Just a comment on sustainability. We launched our strategy a year ago in terms of building new futures. In that carbon, we're looking to go beyond 0 carbon. Materials, we're looking at 0 waste. And then the community is how do we positively impact more than 1 million people?\nIn 2030 we've now said that we're going to align around science-based targets. We're going to look to a 40% waste reduction and also GBP 3 billion of social value as measured by the TOMS Indices. We've made great progress in that what we will be doing is early, I think, in the first half, we'll actually be publishing our targets, and that's a major step forward in terms of this initiative.\nIn terms of recycling materials, one of our statistics here is that we've recycled, repurposed and reused 99% of the what would have gone to landfill on our HS2 project. I mean that's a phenomenal statistic. And the thing that's interesting about this is a lot of people think about it in terms of this is the right thing to do.\nThe reality is, is this actually does add to the bottom line, if you do it right. So the idea is that we are very pragmatic about we're not doing this because of a good cause we're doing this because we make money from it. And then communities, what we do around the 5% club and actually ensuring local supply chains and people get paid early, it's really important. We're well positioned to capitalize on what is effectively the green infrastructure growth.\nSo really, in summary, when you look at all of that, I mean, in our balance sheet and our investment business, we're really well positioned for 2022. We've got a transformed group where we understand the risk, and we've got confidence in terms of what we can forecast. We've got clear visibility over the next, I'd say, almost 18 months. And we've got a market which is catering to our capability and is a decade of infrastructure growth. I mean this is a great place to be at this time, and it really underpins our confidence that we can comfortably return GBP 150 million of share buyback to our shareholders.\nAnd on that note, we'll turn to Q&A.",

My name is Mollie O'Brien, and I'm Head of Investor Relations at Best Buy. We are very happy to welcome you all this morning. Thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you were able to review our earnings press release from this morning.

We are looking forward to a great meeting. And now I could not be more excited to turn the meeting over to Corie Barry, CEO of Best Buy.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nCEO & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you so much, Mollie. Good morning, everyone. We are so pleased you could join us today as we report our fiscal '22 results and take this opportunity to update our longer-term strategy and our multiyear financial outlook.\nToday, we will discuss how our business has evolved and how we are planning to drive value over the next few years. We're not planning to cover all our initiatives or all our business units. We've tried to be as succinct as possible to focus on the topics and initiatives that we believe are most important for you to understand about our business, our plans and where we believe we're headed, both for fiscal '23 and for the longer term.\nFirst, let's discuss our fiscal '22 results. Fiscal '22 was another record year. In addition to record revenue and earnings, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating and our employees continue to do amazing things in the face of unprecedented challenge and change to support our customers' technology needs in knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. As we discussed when we entered the year, we anchored on 3 concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that were and are shaping our strategic priorities and investments.\nOne, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while still providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is a need and is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important.\nWith these concepts in mind, we piloted numerous store formats to test and learn in the past year. We advanced our flexible workforce initiative and invested in our employees' well-being. We introduced new technology tools designed to support both our customers and also our employees. And we also launched a bold new membership program called Best Buy Totaltech, designed to significantly elevate our customer experience and drive incremental sales. We will be talking more about all these topics today.\nAll of this was against a constantly evolving backdrop. During the year, we navigated supply chain and transportation challenges, uncertainty as virus peaks rolled across the country and then most recently, the disruption from the Omicron wave. Our teams did an amazing job against that backdrop, expertly managing supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic to bring in products our customers needed.\nDuring the year, we continued serving our customers digitally at much higher rates. Our online revenue was 34% of our domestic revenue, and while it declined versus last year, it was up 115% or $8.8 billion compared to 2 years ago. At the same time, we also reached our fastest package delivery speeds ever.\nWe are an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. In fact, the percent of online orders we delivered in 1 day was twice as high as pre-pandemic levels despite the significant increase in volume during that same time frame. These record results are driven by the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology, many of which we discussed at our investor updates both in 2017 and 2019.\nMore importantly, these results are driven by our amazing associates across the company. Over the past 24 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for our customers, and they worked tirelessly to provide excellent service. In fact, despite all the changes we went through in the last year, we delivered NPS improvements both online and in our stores. I am truly grateful for and continue to be impressed by our associates' dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination.\nFrom a financial perspective, we delivered record revenue and earnings per share. Our comparable sales growth was 10.4% on top of a very strong 9.7% last year, growing $8 billion over the past 2 years. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was just over $10, up 27% compared to last year. And compared to 2 years ago, we expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 110 basis points. Our non-GAAP return on investment improved 840 basis points compared to 2 years ago, and we drove more than $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the last 2 years. In fiscal '22, we returned $4.2 billion of that to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe also continued to deepen our commitment to the community and the environment. Many of you may have had the opportunity to view the video that was playing before the event started. We continue to believe that our ESG efforts are directly tied to long-term value creation. And I am proud of all our initiatives but we only have time for me to cover a few examples today. We committed to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry.\nWe also committed to opening 100 Teen Tech Centers by fiscal '25. During fiscal '22, we opened 9 to end the year with a total of 44. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. In addition, we're building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future.\nIn terms of the environment, in fiscal '22, we were a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative, committing to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. We are also driving sustainability through the unique consumer electronic circular economy. We help keep devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek Squad repair services, responsible recycling and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth, and we are honored to be recognized for our work.\nNotably, we have placed in the top 5 on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list for the past 5 years in a row. This ranking recognizes our strong performance across all aspects of ESG. In addition, we are on the CDP Climate A List for the fifth year, which recognizes leadership in making a positive impact on the environment.\nNow let's move on to our Q4 results. I am extremely proud of what we accomplished during the fourth quarter. Our team showed remarkable execution and dedication to serving our customers throughout the important gift-giving season. This was evidenced by the fact that we drove improvement in year-over-year customer NPS metrics across almost all areas, particularly for in-store, online and chat experiences.\nIn fact, we saw our best ever customer satisfaction scores for our in-store pickup experience. Online sales were almost 40% of domestic revenue compared to 43% last year and 25% in Q4 of fiscal '20. We reached our fastest holiday delivery times ever, shipping products to customer homes more than 25% faster than last year and 2 years ago. We also completed the purchase of 2 companies that aligned with our strategy, which Jason and Deborah will talk about later this morning.\nWe are deliberately investing in our future and furthering our competitive differentiation. This, as we expected, is temporarily impacting our profitability. The biggest areas of investment in Q4 were our new membership program, technology and Best Buy Health, all core to our future growth potential. In the face of unexpected change, I remain inspired by the way our teams across the enterprise remain flexible to ensure our customers were able to find the perfect gift. We remain well positioned as we head into fiscal '23 as the unique technology provider for the home.\nI'll turn the meeting over to Matt to cover more details on our Q4 results and fiscal '23 outlook. Matt?\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Corie, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were all able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results.\nOur Q4 revenue was $16.4 billion. Our domestic comparable sales declined 2.1%, and our enterprise comp sales declined 2.3%. Revenue grew 8% versus 2 years ago. It was only slightly below the low end of our revenue guidance for the quarter due to a few factors.\nThe first factor was inventory availability. We expected to have pockets of inventory constraints as we entered the quarter and called out a few areas, including appliances, gaming and mobile phones. As the quarter progressed, inventory was more constrained than we anticipated within a few categories and brands. These constraints included some high-demand holiday items, and the categories most impacted were mobile phones and computing.\nThe second factor impacting our results was Omicron. The Omicron wave and the resulting high levels of employee call-outs led to a temporary reduction in our store hours in January and to start fiscal '23. In mid-February, our staffing levels started to improve, and we increased store operating hours for the majority of our stores.\nExcluding these 2 factors, our revenue would have been comfortably in the guidance range we provided for the quarter. From a category standpoint, on a weighted basis, the top areas with positive comparable sales growth included appliances, virtual reality, home theater and headphones. We saw comparable sales declines in gaming, mobile phones, tablets and services.\nTurning now to gross profit. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points to 20.2%. This was about 20 basis points lower than we expected primarily due to increased promotionality. When comparing to last year, the largest driver was our services category, primarily driven by Totaltech.\nOur product margins were largely flat to last year as the benefit from category sales mix was offset by increased promotions. Higher profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement was a benefit to gross profit rate compared to last year. Lastly, our International gross profit rate improved 210 basis points to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our enterprise results.\nOur enterprise non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 5% versus last year, less than our guide of 8% growth primarily due to lower-than-anticipated incentive compensation. Within our Domestic segment, our SG&A dollars increased $139 million. The largest drivers were: one, advertising, which included campaigns for both holiday and to drive awareness for our new membership offering; two, technology; three, increased store and call center labor that helped drive the record customer satisfaction scores Corie shared; and four, Best Buy Health, which includes the impact associated with our acquisition.\nBefore I discuss the fiscal '23 financial outlook, let me spend some time on our new Totaltech membership program. Corie will provide a more holistic overview later in her presentation, but I will add some color on the impacts to our Q4 results and for next year.\nTotaltech is a near-term investment to drive long-term value. The thesis is that over time, we will capture incremental product sales from our members that will lead to higher operating income, but as we discussed in prior earnings calls, it does come with near-term profitability impacts. First, at $199, the stand-alone membership is profitable. It just isn't as profitable as legacy service memberships due to the breadth of benefits and the cost to fulfill them.\nSecond, there's a loss of revenue and profit from existing revenue streams that are now included as benefits in the program. For example, previously stand-alone services like extended warranties and products installations are now included within our Totaltech membership. We still offer these services on a stand-alone basis or to nonmembers, but you can imagine there's an aspect of cannibalization as members are no longer paying incrementally for these items.\nSo what does all this mean? We expect that the gross profit rate of our services category will reset to a new level going forward that is lower than it was prior to launching Totaltech. The way to drive more operating income despite this lower services gross profit rate is to add far more members than we thought was possible under our previous membership offerings. The key to increased profit will be through increased volume through a combination of more recurring membership revenue and incremental product purchases of our members.\nThe number of memberships grew very nicely in Q4, and our plans for fiscal '23 assume continued growth. But it will take some time to reach the scale necessary to offset the lower gross profit rate I just described. Therefore, Totaltech remains a pressure in fiscal '23 but we expect it to be a meaningful driver of both higher sales and operating income dollars in fiscal '25 targets.\nNow let's talk about our overall fiscal '23 outlook. Our guide is anchored around a comparable sales decline in the range of 1% to 4% and a 5.4% non-GAAP operating income rate. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook is $8.85 to $9.15.\nBefore we discuss the broader assumptions driving our guide, I want to touch on our expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is planned at a more normalized level of 24.5% in fiscal '23 compared to 19% rate in fiscal '22. As you may recall, our Q2 results this past year included a $0.47 diluted EPS benefit from the resolution of certain discrete matters.\nNow I would like to share a few important assumptions underpinning our guidance. First, we anticipate the traditional CE industry to decline in the low to mid-single digits next year as we lap the high levels of growth in stimulus actions from this past year. In addition, we anticipate the number of store closures to be in the range of 20 to 30, which is consistent with the trend over the past 5 years.\nAs I mentioned, our fiscal '23 guidance assumes non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.4% compared to 6% in fiscal '22. To be clear, the biggest driver of the lower operating income rate in fiscal '23 is our investment in Totaltech. As I just described, this near-term pressure will drive long-term value for our shareholders.\nThere are, of course, other factors that we expect to impact our results that for the most part offset each other in fiscal '23. We do expect higher levels of promotional activity to pressure our gross profit rate, which is partially offset by the favorable impact of expected growth and our monetization of our advertising business or Best Buy Ads. We expect our full year SG&A expense to be lower than fiscal '22 levels. The largest year-over-year variance is lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our plans after paying out at higher levels in fiscal '22 due to the overachieving of our performance targets.\nWe expect a lower incentive comp to be partially offset by a few areas. The first area is higher technology cost primarily due to annualizing spend in fiscal '22. The second area is higher depreciation and store remodel expense, as Damien will discuss later. And lastly, we expect to see higher SG&A dollars in support of our Best Buy Ads business.\nFinally, as you may have noticed, we are not providing quarterly guidance, but I would like to provide some insight on the assumed phasing for fiscal '23. Due to the strong first half comps last year, we expect our full year comparable sales decline to be weighted more heavily in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect to see significantly more year-over-year operating income rate pressure in the first half of the year compared to the back half.\nTo summarize, the 2 largest variables for fiscal '23 financial results are the short-term industry declines as we lap high growth in government stimulus and the investment in our new membership program that will drive long-term value. As we look to fiscal '25, we expect the CE industry will return to the high levels we saw in fiscal '22 and that Totaltech will drive meaningful growth.\nI will now turn the meeting back over to Corie to begin our strategic update.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nCEO & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you so much, Matt. As I noted closing out my Q4 summary, we remain well positioned as we head into fiscal '23. I'd like to expand on this a bit as we highlight our strategic positioning.\nThere are 3 key points you should take away from this morning. First, technology is a necessity and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. Second, we have built an ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences no one else can. And third, we believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time.\nWe believe we have the right strategy to deliver growth and value for all stakeholders, and we are excited to go into more detail about our plans. But first, let's do some level setting. Our purpose is unchanged, and more relevant today, this minute than ever, our purpose to enrich lives through technology is enduring. And we have honed our 5-year vision.\nWe personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. Technology is no longer a nice to have, it is a necessity and it is expanding into all parts of our lives and homes. Working has forever changed. Streaming content has exponentially grown. The metaverse is coming to life.\nWe can power our homes with connected solar panels. Cars are connected. And we can monitor our health, including connecting with the physician, from our living room. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology, and we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers' homes, right for their lives.\nFor example, we will send a consultant to your home for free to optimize the tech you have or add the tech you want. We can repair your phone's screen and you can try VR headsets while you wait. You can meet with a fitness consultant in our virtual store, who will match your fitness goals with our fitness products or you can use our Lively device to connect with a caring center agent who can help you schedule a lift. These are just some examples, and you'll see this come to life in many more ways throughout our presentation this morning.\nFrom a financial perspective, we delivered remarkable results over the past 2 years, and we are far ahead of where we expected to be when we set our long-term financial targets back in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, in the past 2 years, we have delivered more than $8 billion of revenue growth and improved our operating income rate by 110 basis points to 6%. We are in a strong position to drive the business forward and deliver growth.\nWe do not for 1 minute believe we hit our peak revenue and margin this past year. As Matt outlined, we do expect fiscal '23 to look different as the industry cycles the last 2 years of unusually strong demand and we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. But in fiscal '25, we expect to deliver revenue growth and expand our operating income rate beyond what we reported in fiscal '22. As we have always said, in order to deliver these financial results, it is paramount that we stay focused on our goal to remain a best place to work and we continue to deepen relationships with our customers.\nAs you can see, our new fiscal '25 targets are materially higher than what we thought just back in 2019. We now expect to generate approximately $1 billion more in operating income than our original targets. Given our margin rate, this is considerable growth in operating income dollars.\nSo what's changed since 2019? Well, the CE industry is larger than we expected. Our online mix has nearly doubled. We have found ways to make our operating model more flexible and efficient while also investing in wages and benefits. We are accelerating our category expansion, and we have launched an entirely new membership program.\nOn the flip side, the financial contribution from Best Buy Health is clearer but also a bit longer term than we had originally modeled. This is based on primarily 2 things. First, demand in the active aging business and product constraints were impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, based on our internal learnings and insights from consumer behavior changes over the past 2 years, we tuned our strategy to focus on the growing virtual care opportunity, which Deborah will discuss in more detail later.\nAs we think about our strategy going forward, it is important to look at how dramatically our business has evolved over the past several years. Here, we use fiscal '15 to give a longer-term view to what a different business we have become. Most of these changes were already in motion before the pandemic and then accelerated significantly in the past 2 years. Let me expand on a few points here.\nI already mentioned our fiscal '22 online business was 34% of our Domestic sales. That is more than $16 billion in sales compared to just $3.5 billion in fiscal '15. When you look at how we use our stores for fulfillment, the increase in the sheer number of products customers are picking up in our stores is impressive. This is even more meaningful when you consider the fact that our delivery speed is industry leading and we cut delivery speed essentially in half over the past several years. Clearly, customers value our stores and the convenience and choice they provide. As Damien is going to discuss, we are increasingly interacting with customers via digital channels like chats and video and in their homes.\nAnd finally, membership is incredibly important, both now and into our future. Our Totaltech membership is a big theme of today's presentation, but don't lose sight of the fact that we were a pioneer in loyalty programs. And our My Best Buy program now has more than 100 million total members.\nSo with all of that as background, I'd like to tap back to our first key takeaway. Technology is a necessity and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. So let's start with some industry context.\nThe traditional CE industry is large and growing. There's no perfect external source that tracks our business, so here, we're showing a historical view based on selected government PCE category data. Our outlook is based on multiple industry forecasts and internal data. As you can see on this chart, the industry was growing for several years and then accelerated during the last 2 years. As Matt mentioned, we expect it to step back this year as the industry absorbs the very high growth of the past 2 years. By fiscal '25, we believe it can be back to fiscal '22 levels, which is materially higher than it was pre pandemic.\nIn addition, we're expanding our addressable market by entering new categories in areas like health and electric bikes that are being disrupted by technology in a good way as well as areas where we can really complete solutions for customers like indoor and outdoor living. Jason will provide a bit more detail on these in a few minutes.\nAs a reminder, this is also a stable industry. Contrary to some sentiment, technology is no more volatile or cyclical than other large durable goods categories over time, and the last 2 years have significantly underscored the importance of technology in day-to-day life. What historically was seen as a want has become a need. 40% of Americans use digital technology or the Internet in new or different ways compared with before the pandemic, and the use of telemedicine is triple what it was in just Q1 of 2020.\nThe majority of people who started or increased activities like online fitness, telemedicine, videoconferencing and connecting socially with others virtually say they plan to continue this increased usage even after the pandemic. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care and connect has changed and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before and they're also more tech connected than they ever had been before.\nAs a result, there is an overall larger installed base of consumers using technology. People own more tech devices than ever before. This combination of more devices and more activities also means customers need their tech to work seamlessly every day. True tech support when the customer wants it underpins living this way and is our unique asset across all these devices.\nAnd technology is extending into all aspects of our home, and we've all grown to depend on it. This is not a heat-driven category. It is an industry that is need-based, stable and has been growing. We firmly believe people will continue to use technology more and both need and want to replace or upgrade their products. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely some we haven't even heard of yet means innovation is constant, and that innovation drives interest, upgrades and experimentation into the future. This is not a static industry.\nSo to talk about this exciting world of technology innovation, I'm honored to welcome Jason Bonfig, our Chief Merchandising Officer.\n\nJason J. Bonfig\n\nChief Merchandising Officer, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Corie. Good morning. We continue to lead the tech industry with significant high share in high-consideration categories. What I mean by a high-consideration category, generally higher ASPs and a longer period of time from when you start to think about purchasing to when you actually purchase.\nContinuing to grow our share in these large categories like television and computing will always be a cornerstone of our strategy, but to be truly there for our customers and all their technology needs, we need to accelerate our share across other areas of technology as well and also some new spaces. This is where Totaltech comes in. On products with lower ASPs and shorter upgrade and consideration cycles, our share is generally lower. Totaltech creates a new value proposition that benefits customers when they consolidate their technology shopping at Best Buy.\nI want to give 3 examples of a customer journey that illustrate this point. Let's start with a customer that actually wants to upgrade their kitchen. They want to buy an entirely new kitchen suite with 3 pieces. That customer that has Totaltech does not have to worry about delivery and install. It's included in the price. That could be between a $400 and $500 value.\nA little bit later in the year, the same customer hypothetically breaks their phone. They want to get a new iPhone. When they purchase that iPhone at Best Buy, AppleCare is included. Just in the first year, that's just under $120 of value. Then a little bit later in the year, they want to get a new pair of wireless headphones. If you purchase those headphones at Best Buy, the warranty is also included if you're a Totaltech member. That's a $30 value. Examples like these is where Totaltech benefits come to life for our customers and create a reason to make a considered visit to our app, our website, our store and increases Best Buy share across all of the categories on the slide behind me.\nTechnology innovation never stops. And even when you look over the past 3 years, you can see value of the new technology and what it creates for our customers. During the pandemic, the majority of the focus was around creating products to meet customer demand. This was a distraction, but even with that, there was significant innovation and value created by our vendors.\nThe slide behind me highlights an upgrade over a 3-year period of similar price points across laptops and televisions. While I won't hit on every new feature and advancement that happened, I'll highlight a few. For televisions, you get a full 10 inches more in screen size, almost no Bezel and the ability to navigate your TV with voice if you'd like to. On the laptop side, you can log in with your face. It's faster, thinner, lighter and has significantly longer battery life.\nThese continued evolutionary innovation cycles are never ending, and they drive growth. They create reasons to upgrade and unlock new and better experiences for our customers each and every year. In fact, when we look at our customers' behavior, we're seeing a 7% to 15% reduction in the amount of time it takes a customer to get back into a category. They're coming back to categories faster because of these innovations by our vendors.\nI've highlighted how Totaltech and our vendor innovations will drive growth. Now I'd like to highlight some macro trends that will also drive opportunities in our business. I'll start with 5G and fiber. The expansion of speed and networks in general are really, really good for customers and technology. You can download a movie in minutes, collaborate with others instantly, access a video game or video content anywhere you want without latency. These are things that will drive new experiences and growth for our customers.\nThe next trend is the metaverse and cloud. Have virtual experiences, play golf with friends or family members virtually, travel to places that you actually can't and have a full experience in the virtual world. In addition to that, when you look at the virtual world and cloud, there are new experiences that are created. Previously, you could just play a game on a gaming system and your television. Now you can take that same game seamlessly from the system to your phone to your tablet. In fact, if some of you have children like I do, you're constantly battling the ability for them to play anywhere they want, anytime they want.\nThe cloud also solves a significant customer pain points. Previously, our customers would tell us when they wanted to upgrade a computing product, it would take them 60 minutes to get it the exact way they'd want to that would be moving their icons, their data, just getting it the way the old one was and having the features of the new. Today, with cloud, you simply put in your credentials and in 10 to 15 minutes, it's actually exactly the way you want. You get all the benefits of the new technology and you get all of the placement and all the setup of your old product instantly. That does drive upgrade and it drives interest in customers in upgrading more frequently.\nThe next trend I would like to talk about is automation and support. The connected home has been around for years, and it's now moving into automation and support more specifically. Single-function devices like robot vacuums today; tomorrow, they'll move into security of the entire home, communication and assistance for individuals. This is very, very important as our population ages and people want to stay in their homes longer. Automation and support is one of the ways where technology can enable people to just do that and accomplish their goals and solve that pain point.\nNext, I'd like to talk about customization and personalization. Customers have always wanted to express themselves, and technology is not excluded from that. But there has been significant advancement in manufacturing from appliances to cellphones where customers can express themselves with a touch of color, a family photo or any other type of personal expression that they'd like to integrate into the products.\nSustainability is also a significant trend that's important to customers but also very important to Best Buy. I'll start with a vendor example. Samsung televisions that we sell in our stores today have what is called Samsung solar cell technology in their remote controls. This eliminates the need for batteries, which is obviously very beneficial to the environment. But it also charges off of not only solar but ambient light in the home, and it means that you're never going to have a remote that's out of power. That solves a significant customer pain point. Technology like this will expand to more and more categories and drive upgrade cycles.\nIn addition to that, we want to make sure that we're supporting customers that want to upgrade more frequently. Today, you see that come to life with our recycling and trade-in programs which are a very important part of our value proposition to customers. Over time, that will start to move into new usage models that may actually be upfront conversations about exactly how long a customer wants to use a product and when that next upgrade will happen. Will it be 1 year? Will it be 2 years? Or will it be 3 years as we move forward?\nLet's watch a video highlighting many of the areas I've talked about and even some new additional areas that will drive growth.\n(presentation)\nI'd like to thank our friends at Samsung for that assist and that demo. As we look over the past decade, we've had over $12 billion in sales growth with the vast majority coming from large categories like TVs, computing and appliances and 1/3 coming from new categories like wearables and VR, just to name a few. As we move forward, that innovation will continue, and there will continue to be new categories that don't even exist today.\nWe're also looking to accelerate that expansion by entering new categories that are aligned with where our customers want us to be and places where Best Buy can solve real customer pain points. For the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to focus on these 5 areas of expansion. I'll go a bit deeper on 3 of these, fitness and wellness, outdoor living and personal electric transportation, in the next few minutes.\nI'll start with fitness and wellness. This is a $34 billion industry that we are uniquely positioned to compete in with our Blue Shirts but also our large product fulfillment network that was built for televisions and appliances. Our assortment has grown by 650% in the last 12 months, and we are implementing a larger, more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months with dedicated zones for vendors. Damien will touch on the virtual store a little bit later, but customers today actually have the ability to have a virtual chat or video consultation with a fitness expert.\nThe next area I'd like to talk about is personal electric transportation. This is a $3 billion industry with rapid growth. We've introduced 250 new products this holiday with 500 additional accessories around those products. We'll be adding physical assortment to 900 stores and a more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months. We currently offer assembly, and we're in the pilot stages of service and support and repair for our customers.\nThe last category I'd like to highlight is outdoor living. This is over a $30 billion industry, and our acquisition of Yardbird, a leading premium outdoor furniture company, provides the ability for us to accelerate this business across a nationwide network. That acquisition, combined with our strength in outdoor television and audio and new partnerships with leading brands like Traeger, Weber and Bromic, create a comprehensive solution for our customers. When we couple that assortment with our home consultants and the physical and digital experiences that we've developed for customers, this is a really, really fast-moving category that has the ability to grow. You'll start to see Yardbird products as fast as this spring in Southern California market, and we're very excited about that.\nTo reiterate, we expect growth from Totaltech, consistent innovation from our vendors, macro trends that I've mentioned, new product categories that we don't even know about yet and 5 new areas of expansion to move our business forward. Thank you. I'll hand it back to you, Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nCEO & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThanks so much, Jason. Obviously, you are the expert. Back to our second key takeaway. We have built a unique ecosystem of customer-centric assets delivering experiences that no one else can.\nConsumer electronics is a distinctive industry. The products are constantly evolving, they're connected to networks that are constantly evolving, they all use different operating systems and they range from small and powerful to large and breakable, often at high price points. And customers are more comfortable using tech than they have ever been yet. They also admit it's likely not doing all it could to make their lives better.\nAgainst that backdrop, we have built a unique ecosystem of assets that all work together to create a stickier and more valuable relationship with the customer. And we're investing in this ecosystem as we pivot against a backdrop of even higher customer expectations. We'll provide more depth on a number of these assets through the rest of the presentation.\nSo anchoring this ecosystem is our expert advice and service. Customers are excited about tech and want to be confident in their purchase. We provide that in ways literally no one else can, from our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations all the way to tech support when your tech isn't working the way you want or trade in and recycling when you want to upgrade. And then building on that strength, our Totaltech membership ties these experiences together and provides unique benefits that customers value and no one else can provide. We then combine those unique experiences with our strength in omnichannel retailing, industry-leading and seamless shopping experiences and services across all channels, including in home, in store, digitally, remotely and virtually.\nAnd finally, all these interactions provide us rich data and insights across customer experiences to create personalized technology solution tailored to the customer-specific technology and needs. And all this data fuels our business like Best Buy Ads, matching our partners' marketing to the most appropriate audiences based on our first-party data. When this ecosystem works together, it provides a unique experience tailored to the customer. It also reaches beyond our consumers into business partners, suppliers and other strategic relationships that leverage our capabilities. Whether it's our consultative services highlighted on partners' websites or vendors leveraging our in-store pickup to fulfill from their websites, others value our capabilities.\nSo let me add some color around the first part of the ecosystem. As I said, customers are excited about tech and want to be confident with their purchase, particularly when it's part of their daily life at home. So instead of me trying to describe all the parts and pieces to you, I think this video does an excellent job bringing to life the unique ways we provide expert advice and services seamlessly across all our touch points.\n(presentation)\nSo again, just to reinforce, there is no one else that can provide this type of immersive experience at scale in a world where more and more of our lives are being lived in a way that requires technology. And we felt it was important to double down on our unique capabilities with an equally unique membership offer. This represents literally years of customer research and innovation and truly puts the customer at the center of our investments.\nMatt talked earlier about the financial implications of our new membership program. Now I get to talk about the fun part. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. Matt and Jason already mentioned some of the benefits, but as a reminder, Totaltech includes product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, extended warranties on products and much more.\nBecause the membership is so comprehensive, it has broad appeal among our customers. There is truly something for everyone. And the benefit that's most appealing can vary based on a customer's unique shopping journey or their stage in life. So let me share some early examples. I say early because as a reminder, we literally just rolled this program nationally in mid-October.\nThe benefits associated with purchasing products like product warranty and member pricing are being leveraged the most. Younger generations are using these benefits, especially AppleCare, at a higher rate than older generations. This is exciting and important as extended warranties as a stand-alone business was definitely not a growing part of our business or strategy. And additionally, it's exciting that our employees have embraced this offer. Realizing the suite of benefits means there is something in it for every customer. This makes for a more comfortable and natural sales environment and allows the employees to truly focus on the customers' needs.\nThe VIP access to phone and chat support and access to Geek Squad support and services in general are used more often by older generations, which our legacy plans over indexed on. And the access to hard-to-get inventory is resonating with some of our most engaged customers who already interact and spend with us very frequently. That broad appeal is one of the main reasons we rolled out this program. We have significantly elevated the customer experience by packaging up unique benefits our customers value that no one else can provide, and by doing so, we believe we have made it inconceivable for them to purchase their tech anywhere else.\nFrom a business perspective, of course, the goal is to increase customer frequency and capture a larger share of CE spend. As a specialty retailer, our customer frequency has a different profile than mass merchants. As a result, it is even more crucial that we stay in the consideration set as customers are building out their technology solutions. I am incredibly happy to say that we are indeed seeing increased interactions with our Totaltech customers to the tune of about 60%. Also, when we look at NPS surveys specifically from customers who are Totaltech members, they are running about 1,400 basis points higher than nonmembers. From a spend perspective, it's difficult to calculate with precision given the early stage of the membership and our historical customer frequency, but we currently believe customers who sign up for the membership are spending about 20% more than they would have if they did not have the membership.\nWe already have 4.6 million members. Now to be transparent, we auto converted 3.7 million Totaltech support and other legacy support programs. We have actively enrolled more than 1 million members since launching nationwide in October, and we see a path to double the number of members by the end of fiscal '25. This membership program is a vital addition to our customer relationship ecosystem, providing an offer that no one else can and interaction data that is incredibly valuable to all aspects of our business, fueling our growth over time. And to deliver this offer seamlessly, we leverage another part of our ecosystem: omnichannel retailing strength.\nTo provide more depth on the evolution of our omnichannel retailing model, I am pleased to welcome Damien Harmon, our EVP of Omnichannel, to the stage to talk to you about how we are optimizing our workforce, reimagining our physical presence and leveraging technology. Damien?\n\nDamien Harmon\n\nEVP of Omnichannel, Best Buy Co., Inc.",
    "content2": "Thank you, Corie. It's great to be here with you today to talk about our accomplishments and our plans for this year and beyond across our omnichannel portfolio. As Corie mentioned earlier, omnichannel retail is a critical component of our strategic ecosystem. It's the most direct way to connect our strategy to the needs of our customers and employees.\nLet's look at the last 2 years before we dive into where we're going. These last 2 years have challenged our employees in ways we could have never imagined. Powered by our strategic investments, we were able to serve our customers' needs and grow the business.\nThere are 2 areas I want to highlight. First, the connection between our online sales, which expanded to 34% of our total Domestic revenue, and the 150% growth we've seen in our virtual interaction across video, chat and voice. Today, 84% of Best Buy customers use digital channels throughout their shopping journey. These virtual opportunities have created new ways for us to offer customers the immediate ability to shop with an expert wherever they are.\nSecond, and also connected to our customers using digital channels throughout their shopping journey, is we've seen a 72% growth in customers who are using our app while in our stores. This also creates an opportunity for us to build more digital interactions and technology-related solutions to support their needs. These numbers are amazing. We could not be more proud of our teams and how they've delivered. Just as importantly, it gives us an incredible foundation for continued growth and optimism as we look to the future.\nNow from an omnichannel perspective, we look at the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. The 2 main drivers of that and what I'm going to talk about today are how we optimize our workforce and reimagine our physical presence in ways that serve our customers' needs in an ever-growing digital world. Our focus is on further developing our teammates to give them the skills to help customers inside and outside of our stores, but more importantly, through any number of digital channels at our customers' fingertips. At the same time, we will optimize our store portfolio, and as Matt mentioned, we will maintain the trend of closing 20 to 30 stores per year. However, with online penetration growing so rapidly in the last 2 years, we're making investments in our stores to provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as customers move from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home.\nSo I'll start with our people. We have significantly improved efficiency and productivity of our store labor model. We've seen a more than 100 basis point improvement in store domestic labor expense as a percentage of revenue compared to FY '20. We've also materially increased store productivity over the past 2 years. We've done this by reskilling our teammates and making investments that lean into physical and digital shopping experience.\nA few examples include our fulfillment improvements, consultation labor and our virtual store. This allows us to leverage our employees more effectively inside and outside of our stores. The great news is that as we've made these adjustments, we've maintained a strong NPS in our stores. These investments in our people have allowed us to help them learn new skills, grow their careers, gain flexibility and realize their dream by keeping them with us longer.\nWe've increased our average wage rate 20% in the last 2 years by raising our minimum wage to $15 an hour and shifting some of our employees into higher-skilled, higher-paying roles. In fact, our average wage for our field employees this year will be over $18 an hour. Since we've started our flexible workforce initiative in 2020, 80% of our talented associates are now skilled to support multiple jobs inside and outside of our stores, and we're proud of the fact that our field turnover rates remain significantly below retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates.\nOverall, we're in a place we like right now. We're becoming more efficient without losing sight of delivering amazing experiences for our customers and our employees. We're going to continue to strike the balance between spend and productivity as we look at the factors that I've just outlined.\nNow an obvious differentiator for our workforce is our Geek Squad team, which continues to deliver an experience that creates repeat customers, builds trust and drives incremental spend.\n(technical difficulty)\npercent of our mobile phone customers are new\n(technical difficulty)\naverage tenure of\n(technical difficulty)\nNo one can match that level of expertise at the scale we can. That has helped us produce fantastic NPS results in store, in home and through our remote\n(technical difficulty)\nacross all Geek Squad services. Geek Squad will be a vital part of our Totaltech initiative, and we'll continue to offer stand-alone\n(technical difficulty)\nour expertise through consultations as well, both inside and outside of our stores. These consultations provide a direct access to customers for our ever-growing set of experts. Employees will have the\n(technical difficulty)\nAnd with each consultation, we can\n(technical difficulty)\n17% more across their lifetime value and they purchase more often when engaged for a consultation.\nCustomers are\n(technical difficulty)\n92% of customers say they will likely continue working with their expert. And when customers are engaged with one of our consultants or designers, they shop with Best Buy 2x more frequently. So looking ahead, we believe\n(technical difficulty)\n200% by fiscal '25.\nAs you saw earlier, we had 45 million virtual interactions across all channels, creating opportunities to engage our customers differently.\nWe're\n(technical difficulty)\nlast fall. To date, our virtual store in comparison to historical chat experiences is generating higher close rate, higher sales and a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction.\nAnd that's not all. Our vendors are extremely excited about it as well. We started with 17 vendors onboard, and we will end fiscal '23 with over 60 vendors investing in our virtual store. This is an investment in us and the belief that we're creating a totally differentiating experience. We're expanding our virtual store and adding more categories like appliances and home theater, and we expect our virtual sales interactions to double by fiscal '25.\nSo let's talk about ways we're reimagining our store in support of our physical and digital shopping experiences. We are very excited about the things that we're testing, learning and in some cases, implementing in our stores. First, let's talk about our experiential store. In 2020, we launched a test in one of our Houston stores and added 2 additional locations since then.\nSome of the key enhancements include dedicated showcase spaces for some of the new categories Jason mentioned earlier like e-transportation, outdoor living, fitness. We expanded our Microsoft and Apple shops and dedicated more space to premium experiences like appliances, home theater and audio. We expanded our Geek Squad presence for more customer interactions and space for repair services.\nAnd we've also enhanced fulfillment capabilities to include exterior lockers, additional space for shipping, packing and fulfilling from our store warehouses.\nAnd we're excited about the performance. We've seen a 370 basis point improvement in NPS. We've seen a steady lift in customer penetration in the retail trade area as well as overall customer spend. And we expect to continue to see strong revenue lift in these experiential stores. And we will remodel 50 locations in fiscal '23 and about 300 locations expected by fiscal '25.\nNow I want to highlight our 16 outlet stores\n(technical difficulty)\nopen box, clearance, end-of-life and otherwise distressed large product inventory across major appliances and televisions which might otherwise be liquidated at a significant lower recovery rate. These outlets unlock value by alleviating space and capacity from our core stores, and they are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in the landfill.\nIn FY '22, gross liquidation recovery rate is almost 2x higher than alternative channels. These locations are attracting new and reengaged customers. 16% of customers are new and 37% of customers are reengaged. In FY '23, we will double the amount of outlet stores, and we'll test expanding our assortments by adding computing, gaming and mobile phones.\nAs we discussed last year, we launched a test in Charlotte of a new holistic market approach. And as I mentioned earlier, the ways people are shopping today are entirely different than how they shop 2 years ago, and our stores and the way they operate need to change and adjust accordingly. This work in Charlotte is a manifestation of the shopping evolution, and this pilot leverages all of our assets in a forward portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlets, consultation labor, and we bring it all together with our digital app.\nWithin the test, we are looking at how a variety of store formats across 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square feet locations can serve the customer's needs. And this summer, we will be introducing a 5,000-square-foot store into the marketplace. When you look at the before and after map of the Charlotte market, you can see we have reduced our overall square footage by 5% and yet, we've increased our customer coverage in the marketplace from 76% to 85%. We've also added 260 access points where customers can get their gear and employee delivery covers nearly half of the metro. So looking ahead, we'll be focusing on using this market to learn in fiscal '23 before we make decisions on what to scale or what not do.\nTechnology enhancements are at the center of many of the changes I just mentioned, from self-checkout to virtual store, technology supporting our teams and customers in new and exciting ways. Take a look at this video to see what we're doing.\n(presentation)\nAs you can see, technology brings it all together in support of our optimized workforce and how our physical locations will enhance the shopping experience inside and outside of our stores. We're excited about this year and our future as we focus on the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to our President of Best Buy Health, Deborah DiSanzo.\n\nDeborah DiSanzo Eldracher\n\nPresident of Best Buy Health, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Damien. Here is the ecosystem slide Corie and Damien shared, and it's a perfect introduction to Best Buy Health as our work is an excellent example of the Best Buy ecosystem and flywheel.\nToday, I will share the strategy of health at Best Buy. But first, let's see it come to life in this video.\n(presentation)\nI hope the video begins to answer the question that I hear often: Why in the world is Best Buy in health? I understand the question because health is complex, it has a longer return on investment and other companies have not succeeded.\nSo why will Best Buy succeed? We didn't build this strategy to be like any other company or to change who Best Buy is. We built our strategy on Best Buy's strengths, our world-class omnichannel, distribution and logistics, strong analytics, presence in the home and our empathetic caring center agents.\nOur strategy is supported by the rapid consumerization of health and 2 significant trends. First, technology is moving into health. We recognize an $80 billion market opportunity for health technology and the desire for consumers to use technology to manage their health.\nAnd second, health is moving into the home. By 2025, an estimated $265 billion in Medicare services will move into the home and 61% of patients say they would choose hospital care at home. And Best Buy has long proven we're a trusted adviser for technology in the home. 70% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Best Buy store, able to shop health and wellness products, speak with our expert Blue Shirts and utilize our distribution hubs to fulfill their health technology needs. Geek Squad makes 9 million home visits annually, helping consumers set up technology and perhaps more importantly, teaching them how to use it.\nAnd we have the confidence of our customers and partners as we work to help enhance the health industry. Our strategy is to enable care at home, building on the strengths in 3 focal areas. In consumer health, we provide curated health and wellness products. In active aging, we offer health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. In virtual care, we connect patients with their physicians and enable care at home. Our presence in each of these focal areas creates a flywheel where growth in one adds momentum to the other 2. This is the strength of our story.\nNow let us look at the customer journey. Jason touched on a few areas of consumer health earlier, and our video introduced you to Angela, a 45-year-old mother and caregiver to an aging father. You saw her purchase a Tyto Care home medical kit when her son was sick, and Angela can find countless other products to support the health of her family, from weighted blankets to exercise equipment to blood pressure cuffs and more. These products not only support our customers in their day-to-day health but also serve as an entry to our other 2 focal areas: active aging and virtual care.\nLively supports adults who want to age independently at home. Our easy-to-use phones and personal emergency response devices feature one-touch access to our caring center and services like urgent response, fall detection and more, providing patients and caregivers with the peace of mind that care is only a call away. Last year, we launched our new Lively brand and a Lively partnership with Apple to feature our health and safety services on Apple Watch. And today, I'm happy to announce Lively on Alexa, which will launch this spring.\nOur Lively monthly subscription service provides a consistent revenue stream, and last year, we drove 15% year-over-year growth by adding 348,000 new lives served. Our caring center agents connected with our customers over 9 million times last year, offering a variety of health and safety services.\nSo let's jump back to Angela's story. Angela worries about her father living at home alone so she purchases a Lively smartphone and an Amazon Echo for her dad from Best Buy, along with a monthly Lively health and safety subscription plan. Jacob uses his Lively Smart to request a Lyft ride to a doctor's office through a caring center agent. He had a minor fall at home and uses his Amazon Echo to alert the caring center, who can follow protocol to determine if emergency medical services are needed. And this patient journey is just one example of the many ways Lively supports active aging adults at home.\nNow let's look at virtual care. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps the most exciting opportunity lies within virtual care, where we enable patients to connect with their care teams. In November, we acquired Current Health. Current Health is making inroads into care at home through securing strong partnerships with successful programs at Baptist Health, Mount Sinai, AbbVie, the Defense Health Agency and more. Our acquisition merges Current Health's FDA-cleared at-home platform with Best Buy's scale, expertise and connection to the home. Together, we create a powerful virtual care experience.\nJacob is in the hospital with sepsis. The hospital physician identifies and enrolls Jacob into the hospital's hospital at home program. Best Buy sets up Jacob's home with the technology needed for remote patient monitoring and trains both Jacob and Angela on how to use it. This ensures the hospital physician can focus on treating patients rather than being a tech consultant. This is a job that physicians had to play during the pandemic and it overtaxed our health system.\nAt home, Jacob is monitored by Current Health's platform and a virtual command center. The hospital physician checks in daily with video visits to ensure he's healing on track. The command center coordinates Jacob's home medications and notices a lack of data from his monitor. After discovering that he's improperly wearing the device, the Geek Squad is deployed to a system. The platform's algorithm alerts the command center that Jacob has a persistent fever and the on-call health system physician prescribes therapeutic, which is delivered by the pharmacy partner. When Jacob recovers, the hospital physician discharges Jacob, and Jacob continues to be supported by Lively.\nA few of the pieces in this patient journey are still in development, the Geek Squad integrated with Current Health, for example, but this is our direction. And you can see Best Buy is there for the patient with technology, support and connections to enable care at home.\nAnd we're not building this alone. We're creating an ecosystem to support consumers in their care-at-home journey. Consumers are at the heart of our strategy, and throughout a lifetime of health needs, Best Buy is there to help enrich and save lives through technology and meaningful connections.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our health opportunity creates a flywheel, driving growth in all 3 focal areas. Our revenue in fiscal year '22 was $525 million. We're growing 35% to 45% a year, and we are accretive in fiscal year '27 as the health industry has a longer return on investment.\nThank you for your time, and I'll turn it back to Matt.\n\nMatthew M. Bilunas\n\nCFO, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Deborah. You've heard details from Corie, Jason, Damien and Deborah about some key areas that give us excitement about the opportunity in front of us. We firmly believe our differentiated capabilities and focused investments will lead to compelling returns over time. While fiscal '22 was certainly an amazing year, we see a path to even higher revenue and earnings by fiscal '25. And as we look beyond fiscal '25, we see even more opportunity for revenue growth and operating income rate expansion as the benefits from our initiatives like Totaltech and Best Buy Health grow even further.\nBefore I share additional details on our fiscal '25 targets, I would like to review a few guiding behaviors that have been our brand for several years. First, we plan to fund our growth through the cash we generate to return excess cash to shareholders. Second, we are committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $200 million during fiscal '22, taking our cumulative total to $700 million towards the $1 billion goal.\nLet me take a moment to reflect on our past performance. We have talked about our record results over the past couple of years, but it is also important to note that we have had very steady growth in the years leading up to the pandemic. This past year was the eighth straight year of comparable sales growth.\nIn addition, we have expanded our operating income rate, earnings per share and ROI. Earlier in the presentation, we shared our fiscal '25 targets, so I won't cover them in detail here, but I'd like to spend a few minutes on our fiscal '25 assumptions.\nWe expect our revenue in fiscal '25 to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion. This range reflects a 3-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 1% to 3%, despite the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal '23. I would also note that due to expected store closures, our comparable sales CAGR would be approximately 2% to 4%.\nThere are a few key assumptions underlying the revenue expectations. First, as Corie shared, we believe the consumer electronics industry will remain significantly higher than it was prepandemic, and we expect that fiscal '25 will be back to a level similar to fiscal '22.\nSecond, we believe we have an opportunity to capture even more market share than we have in the past. This is due to growth from Totaltech and the store initiatives that Damien talked about.\nAs it relates to Totaltech, we believe that the combination of membership revenue and incremental purchases by members will add approximately $1.5 billion in revenue by fiscal '25 compared to fiscal '23. This is a net impact. So it incorporates the impact of cannibalizing other stand-alone services now part of our membership offering. Of course, we also expect revenue growth from Best Buy Health and the expansion into additional categories that Jason shared earlier.\nAs we move to our fiscal '25 operating income rate outlook, we expect to expand our rate to a range of 6.3% to 6.8%. As we have highlighted, Totaltech is currently pressuring our fiscal '23 operating income rate. Health has also been an area of investment for us over the past few years. However, as each of them scales, we expect them both to meaningfully contribute to our fiscal '25 rate outlook. We also see opportunities to lean in even further on capabilities like our in-house media business, Best Buy Ads, which as Corie mentioned earlier, is fueled by our first-party data.\nWe expect this business will benefit our fiscal '23 operating income with benefits increasing in the out-years. In addition, we expect to see rate benefits from our continued focus on finding cost efficiencies that benefit both gross profit and SG&A. Damien highlighted a number of strategies that are part of this effort.\nAs we've discussed over the past few years, technology will be critical in unlocking many of these opportunities. Of course, there are areas where we will likely see pressure on our rate in the future. The first example of this is pricing. Throughout most of the pandemic, the level of promotions in our categories has been well below levels of fiscal '20. This has been largely a result of higher demand and more challenged or constrained inventory environment. We have seen pockets of promotional activity increase over the past 2 quarters, and our belief is that the promotions will continually progress back to fiscal '20 levels.\nA second area I would highlight is increased spend in technology in our store portfolio. As we have shared over a number of quarters, our technology spend has been increasing in support of our initiatives and overall omnichannel experience. In addition, we expect more depreciation expense from our capital investments in our stores.\nLastly, there are a few other factors we will continue to assess, but at this point, don't see as being material to our rate in fiscal '25 compared to fiscal '23. First, from a store labor standpoint, we expect to maintain expenses at a similar rate of revenue. We will continue to invest in higher pay for our employees, but expect to balance the higher wages to efficiencies, leveraging technology and more flexible workforce.\nSecond, we do not expect channel mix to have a material impact to our rate. As Damien shared earlier, our outlook assumes closing 20 to 30 stores per year through fiscal '25. This assumption reflects our belief that the online channel mix will grow approximately to 40% in fiscal '25.\nWe will continue to apply a rigorous process for lease renewals to ensure we are comfortable with the financial return and overall customer experience. Currently, the vast majority of our stores are cash flow positive, and we believe are essential for us to serve our customers. I'll move next to our cash flow and our capital allocation approach.\nTo start with, we have been generating healthy levels of free cash flow for several years, which provides us ample room to fund our growth investments. Our average annual free cash flow over the past 5 years is more than $2.3 billion. Our capital allocation strategy has been consistent for several years. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive growth, highlighted by the strategies you've heard today. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expense investments.\nNext, we may explore additional partnerships and acquisitions if we believe they will accelerate our ability to achieve more profitable growth. We also plan to continue to be a premium dividend payer and return excess cash through share repurchases. Let me quickly expand on a few of these areas.\nWe expect our annual capital expenditures to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the next 3 years. Earlier, Damien outlined a number of changes to our stores to further our strategy. Consistent with our iterative approach, we will test, learn and deploy once we have vetted anticipated returns of our initiatives. Technology investments are expected to remain similar to fiscal '23, simply decreasing as a mix of our capital deployment.\nThis morning, we announced a 26% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share. Our targeted dividend payout remains in the range of 35% to 45% of prior year's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nLastly, this year marked a record level of share repurchases at $3.5 billion. In fiscal '23, we plan to spend approximately $1.5 billion on share repurchases. So with that, let me turn the stage back over to Corie.\n\nCorie Sue Barry\n\nCEO & Director, Best Buy Co., Inc.\n\nThank you so much, Matt. Extraordinary ecosystems have formed over the past 20, 30, 40 years as digital has transformed every aspect of how we all do business. That same transformation is happening in our homes, meaningfully accelerated in the last 2 years. And while we started as a music retailer selling fun-to-have products, we're now the only company built around the same extraordinary transformation of technology in our lives and in our homes. While others sell some of the same products we do, we alone offer the complete technology solution across manufacturers and operating systems. We are the only company in all channels and at scale that can do everything from design your personalized hardware and software solution in the home, to install and connect all of it, to keep it working when there are any issues from unreliable networks to broken screens. These assets appeal not only to our customers, but they are also unique and investable for our marketing partners, technology vendors, small business and education relationships and other strategic connections.\nAs we look to the future, we see technology as a permanent and growing need in the home, constantly evolving as the world's largest companies innovate with new use cases around the metaverse, transportation, green electricity and health, just to name a few. We have a unique value creation opportunity into the future and are investing now as we have successfully invested ahead of change in our past to ensure we pivot to meet the needs of our customers and retain our exclusive position in our industry. We are excited to help customers enrich lives through technology in ways no one else can. And with that, we will break for 10 minutes before beginning our Q&A session.\n(Break)\nWelcome back. We are excited to begin the Q&A portion of our event, which we expect to run approximately 45 minutes. But before we do, I want to take this opportunity to introduce and welcome Mark Irvin, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. Many of you spent time with Rob Bass and may know that he recently announced that he is stepping away from a life in retail to pursue some other passions as we have been discussing for quite some time. We are so excited for him and thank him for his incredible work on our supply chain transformation.\nThat incredible work extended to his ability to bring in top-tier talent. One example of that is Mark Irvin, who came to Best Buy in 2013, specifically to work with and learn from Rob. Mark has been an instrumental part of the team that has led our supply chain transformation and is ready to use his lifetime of knowledge in the space to continue to advance our industry-leading supply chain efforts. We are thrilled to have Mark Irvin taking over the reins in supply chain. And we've invited him to join us for Q&A.\nSo operator, we are now ready for our first question."

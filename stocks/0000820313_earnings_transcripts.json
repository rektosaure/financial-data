[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2025 conference call. Our third quarter '25 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. Then of course, we will take your questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter of 2025 with record sales of $6.194 billion, a record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.97 and $0.93, respectively. Third quarter sales were up 53% in U.S. dollars, 52% in local currencies and 41% organically compared to the third quarter of 2024. We Sequential were up 10% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and up 9% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were a record $6.111 billion, up a strong 38% compared to the third quarter of 2024 and up 11% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99:1. Gap and adjusted operating income were both $1.72 billion in the quarter and operating margin was a record 27.5%. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by a strong 560 basis points from the prior year quarter and 190 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on significantly higher sales volumes which was only modestly offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions.\nOn a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels as well as further progress on profitability improvement on acquired businesses. I'm extremely proud of the company's record operating margin performance in the third quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our team. Breaking down third quarter results by segment compared to the third quarter of 2024. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $3.39 billion and increased by 96% in U.S. dollars and 75% organically. Segment operating margin was 32.7%. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.516 billion, an increase by 27% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically and segment operating margin was 27.1%.\nSales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.369 billion and increased by 18% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically and segment operating margin was 20%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.5%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 27%, which compared to 21.4% and 24% in the third quarter of '24, respectively. The increase in our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter is due to some shift in income mix to higher tax jurisdictions during 2025. The third quarter includes an adjustment to bring the year-to-date taxes to 25.5% adjusted effective tax rate, which resulted in a $0.03 impact to our third quarter EPS.\nOur fourth quarter and full year guidance assumes this higher 25.5% tax rate, and we expect this higher tax rate to continue into 2026. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.97 in the third quarter, up 102% compared to the prior year period. and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 86% to a record $0.93 compared to $0.50 in the third quarter of '24. This was an outstanding result. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $1.471 million or 117% of net income and free cash flow was $1.215 billion or 97% of net income, also an excellent result. From a capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were all within our normal range.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $109 and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the third quarter of 2025 was approximately $354 million. As noted in the earnings release, the company has increased its quarterly dividend by 52% to $0.25 per share effective for payments beginning in January of 2026. Total debt on September 30 was $8.1 billion, and net debt was $4.2 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $10.9 billion, and this included cash and short-term investments on hand of $3.9 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities, including the $4 billion term loan facility recently put in place in anticipation of the CCS acquisition.\nThird quarter 2025 EBITDA was $2 billion, and our net leverage ratio was 0.7x at the end of the quarter. As of September 30, the company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility or its commercial paper programs. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and thank you to everybody for taking the time to join our call today. And I hope that all of you are having an enjoyable fall, I can tell you it's a beautiful day here in Connecticut. I'm going to highlight our achievements in the third quarter. I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. and then comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. And then, of course, we'll have time for questions thereafter. There's no doubt that our results in the third quarter were much stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nSales grew from prior year by a very strong 53% in U.S. dollars and 52% in local currencies, reaching a new record $6.94 billion or nearly $6.2 billion. On an organic basis, sales increased by a very strong 41%, the same level that we actually achieved in the second quarter, and this was driven by double-digit organic growth in all but one of our end markets. We're very pleased that the company booked a record $6.1 billion in orders in the third quarter, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.99:1. Orders grew by a very strong 38% from prior year and were also up 11% sequentially. I have to say that we're particularly pleased to have delivered record operating margins of 27.5% in the quarter an increase of 560 basis points from our prior year adjusted operating margin and 190 basis points sequentially.\nThis strong profitability is a direct result of the outstanding execution of the Amphenol team around the world, all of whom continue to manage extremely well in a very dynamic environment. As Craig mentioned, our adjusted diluted EPS also grew very strong 86% from prior year reaching a new record of $0.93. And the company converted those earnings into record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $1.47 billion and $1.215 billion, respectively, both clear demonstrations of the quality of the company's earnings. Finally, I'm very pleased that our Board has approved a 52% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. I just can't express enough my pride in the ethanol team I would just say that our results this quarter once again reaffirm the value of the passion, discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to drive superior performance.\nNow as we announced in mid-August, we're very excited that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Trexon for approximately 1 mile in cash. Trexon is a leading provider of high-reliability, interconnect and cable lies primarily for the defense market and expect to generate 2025 sales and EBITDA [indiscernible] Trexon team to the Amphenol family. We continue to expect this acquisition to close by the end of the fourth quarter. We're pleased as well to announce that we closed on the acquisition of Rochester Sensors earlier in the third quarter. Based in the Dallas, Texas area and with annual sales of approximately $100 million Rochester is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered application-specific liquid-level sensors for the industrial market with a particular focus on propane, heavy vehicle and refrigeration. The company has a strong and long respected brand in the sensor industry and no doubt will be a great complement to our already broad sensor offering.\nIn addition, we remain excited about the pending acquisition of the CCS business from CommScope, given our good progress on the path towards closing, we now expect to close CCS by the end of the first quarter of 2026, about a quarter sooner than originally anticipated. We remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. In fact, it is our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our trends across our served end markets. I would just note that we continue to be very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for the company, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application.\nThe defense market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by a strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. And this is really driven by robust growth across virtually all segments of the defense market with the contributions in particular, related to space, naval, communications and ground vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 8%, which was higher than our expectations coming into the corner. And looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-single-digit increase in sales from these already lofty third quarter levels.\nAnd for the full year 2025, we expect sales to increase by more than 25%. I would just note that this outlook does not include any impact from the Trexon acquisition. We remain encouraged by the company's leading position in the defense interconnect market where we offer the industry's widest range of high-technology products. Amidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world continue to expand their investments into both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our existing offerings as well as the complementary capabilities that Trexon will bring, we're positioned better than ever to capitalize on this long-term demand trend. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales increased by 17% from prior year and 16% organically as we benefited from increasing production levels of our customers, together with our continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Sequentially, our sales grew by 7% from the second quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Now looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-single-digit sales increase from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2025, we expect sales to increase in the high 30% range from last year, helped by the acquisition of CIT back in 2024. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in demand for jetliners, our efforts to expand our product offering -- or expand our product offering, both organically and through our acquisition program continue to pay real dividends.\nIn particular, I just want to mention that we're very pleased with the progress of the CIT team who has now completed more than a full year as part of the Amphenol family. We look forward to further capitalizing on our expanded brand of product solutions for the commercial air market long into the future. The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, and that was really driven by organic growth in all 3 geographies. In particular, our organic growth was driven by strong performance in factory automation, medical, instrumentation, industrial electric vehicles and our heavy equipment segments. On a sequential basis, sales grew by 5% from the second quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nAs we look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these third quarter levels and for the full year of 2025, we expect our sales to grow by approximately 20%, reflecting both strong organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. We remain encouraged by the company's strength across the many diversified segments of this important market. As demand continues to recover, I am confident in our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions.\nIndeed, with the acquisition of Rochester sensors, we have further broadened our sensor offering for the industrial market. And that strategy has really enabled Amphenol to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that are taking place across the diversified industrial markets thereby creating continued opportunities for our outstanding team working in this important area. The automotive market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the third quarter grew by 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically as we once again drove growth in all regions. Sequentially, our sales grew by 8% from the second quarter, which was actually much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And that really reflected the ability of our team to quickly execute on a wide range of opportunities around the world. For the fourth quarter, we expect a moderate sales decline from these third quarter levels. And for the full year of 2025, we expect sales to increase in the mid- to high single-digit range from 2024.\nI remain very proud of our team working in this important market. And while there are no doubt many areas of uncertainty in the global automotive market, our team continues to be focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. We look forward to benefiting from our strength and position in the automotive market for many years to come. The communications networks market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew from prior year by 165% in U.S. dollars and a strong 25% organically as we benefited from the Andrew acquisition that we completed earlier this year as well as from increased spending by both communications network operators and equipment manufacturers.\nSequentially, our sales grew by 8% from the second quarter, which was better than our expectation for sales to remain flat. As we look into the fourth quarter, we do expect sales to decline in the low teens range on normal seasonality. And for the full year we expect more than 130% growth driven by the acquisition of Andrew together with robust organic growth. With our expanded range of technology offerings following the acquisition of Andrew earlier this year, we are well positioned with both service provider and OEM customers across the global communications networks market. Our deep and broad range of products, coupled with an expansive manufacturing footprint, have positioned us to better support customers around the world. And as those customers continue to drive their systems to higher levels of performance, we look forward to enabling these important networks for many years to come.\nThe mobile device market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales moderated by 3% in U.S. dollars and organically as growth in wearables as well as basically flat sales enhanced set year-over-year was more than offset by moderations in sales related to laptops and tablets. Sequentially, our sales did grow by 18% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the third quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full year 2025, we expect sales to grow in the low single-digit range compared to 2024. I remain very proud of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once again enabled us to capture incremental sales in the quarter.\nI'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we're well positioned for the long term. And finally, the IT datacom market represented 37% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter grew by a very strong 128% in U.S. dollars and organically and that was driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in artificial intelligence applications, together with continued robust growth in our base IT datacom business. I'm really proud of our team's outstanding execution here in the third quarter as we were once again able to significantly outperform our expectations in this very exciting market.\nOn a sequential basis, sales increased by 13% from the second quarter, and that was substantially better than our expectation for mid- to high single-digit decline. This outperformance is actually driven both by sales of AI-related products as well as by growth in our base IT datacom business. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these very strong third quarter levels. And for the full year of 2025, we expect our IT datacom sales to more than double compared to prior year. We are more than ever encouraged by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. There's no doubt that our team has done an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation systems with a broad array of customers.\nThe revolution in AI continues to create a unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. Whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnects. Our products are critical components in these next-generation systems, and that creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for the company. Turning to our outlook. And obviously, assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.89 to $0.91. This would represent a sales increase of 39% to 41% and an adjusted diluted EPS increase of 62% to 65% and compared to prior year fourth quarter.\nOur fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full year sales of $22.6 through this year and into the long term. Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity once again to thank our entire global team for what were truly incredible efforts here in the third quarter. they worked unbelievably hard to deliver this level of growth and performance, and I'm truly grateful to each and every one of them. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter of 2025 conference call. Our second quarter '25 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends, and then we will, of course, take questions. .\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter of 2025 with record sales of $5.650 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.86 and $0.81, respectively.\nSecond quarter sales were up 57% in U.S. dollars, 56% in local currencies and 41% organically compared to the second quarter of 2024. Sequentially, sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars, 16% local currencies and 14% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $5.523 billion, up a strong 36% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and up 4% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98:1. GAAP operating income was $1.419 billion in the quarter and GAAP operating margin was a record 25.1%. GAAP operating margin included $29 million of acquisition-related costs.\nExcluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2025 was $1.448 billion, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 25.6%. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by a strong 430 basis points from the prior year -- sorry, from the prior quarter and 210 basis points sequentially.\nThe year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes, which was only modestly offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels as well as further progress on the profitability improvement initiatives on acquisitions.\nI'm extremely proud of the company's record operating margin performance in the second quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our team. Breaking down second quarter results by segment compared to the second quarter of 2024, Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $2.910 billion and increased by 101% in U.S. dollars and 78% organically. Segment operating margin was 30.6%.\nSales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.445 billion and increased by 38% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. Segment operating margin was 25.2%.

GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.86 in the second quarter, up 110% compared to the prior year period and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 84% to a record $0.81 compared to $0.44 in the second quarter of 2024. This was an outstanding result.\nOperating cash flow in the second quarter was a record $1.417 billion or 130% of net income and free cash flow was a record $1.122 billion or 103% of net income. And excellent results, especially considering the growth we have experienced.\nIn the third quarter, we expect capital spending to again be somewhat elevated versus our typical 3% to 4% of sales levels as we continue to invest to support the significant growth we are seeing in the IT datacom market. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were all within our normal range.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $78 and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2025 was approximately $360 million. Total debt on June 30 was $8.1 billion, and net debt was $4.8 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $6.2 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $3.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nExcluding acquisition-related costs, second quarter 2025 EBITDA was $1.7 billion and at the end of the second quarter of 2025, our net leverage ratio was 0.9x. During the quarter, the company completed a successful $750 million U.S. bond offering and a EUR 600 million bond offering. As of June 30, the company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility or its commercial paper programs, and we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $70 million which is reflected in our third quarter guidance.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you from sunny Wallingford, Connecticut, and I hope that all of you on the call here today, together with your family and friends and colleagues are enjoying a wonderful summer so far. .\nAs Craig alluded to, I'm going to highlight our achievements in the second quarter. I'll talk about our trends and progress across our served markets. We'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and then, of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. Let me just say that we drove outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2025. In fact, our results were much stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew from prior year by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 56% in local currencies, reaching a new record $5.650 billion. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by 41%, with all of our end markets experiencing robust organic growth, and I'll talk about those markets, specifically here in a few moments.\nThe company booked a record $5.523 billion in orders in the second quarter and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.98: 1. And these orders grew by 36%, very strong compared to prior year and were also up sequentially from our previous record orders in the first quarter.\nI want to say that we're particularly pleased to deliver record adjusted operating margins of 25.6% in the quarter. This is an increase of 430 basis points from prior year and 210 basis points sequentially. This strong profitability is a direct result of the outstanding execution of the Amphenol team around the world, who continue to manage well in what continues to be a challenging cost environment. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 84% from prior year and reached a new record of $0.81.\nAnd finally, the company generated record operating and free cash flow in the second quarter of $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, both clear reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. I cannot express enough my pride in our team. Amphenol's results this quarter once again reaffirmed the value of the drive, discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic environment.\nWe are very pleased in May to have closed on the acquisition of Narda-MITEQ. And based in Hapag, New York, with annual sales of approximately $120 million, Narda-MITEQ is a leading provider of active RF and microwave components primarily for the defense market. Together with our previously announced acquisitions of XMA and Q Microwave and now with Narda, we're building a strengthened presence in RF interconnect and active RF components which is a great complement to our leading position across RF connector, cable, cable assembly and antenna products for this important market.\nWe remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nNow turning to our served markets. We're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for the company enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being overly exposed to the volatility of any given market or application. The defense market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, and this was driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market.\nSequentially, our sales increased by 13%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter for a high single-digit increase. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels, including the benefit of our acquisition. We remain encouraged by the company's leading position in the defense interconnect market. where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology products.\nWith the addition of Narda-MITEQ, we continue to diversify our already broad product offering to capitalize on the increasing adoption of electronics and defense equipment. Amidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies and we're positioned better than ever to capitalize on this long-term demand trends. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 50% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically from prior year as we benefited from the addition of CIT last year, as well as our continued progress in expanding content on next-generation commercial aircraft.\nSequentially, our sales grew by 6% in U.S. dollars from the first quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we expect our sales to be up in the low single digits from the second quarter levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in demand for jetliners, our efforts to expand our product offering, both organically and through our acquisition program are paying real dividends. In particular, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress of the CIT team as part of Amphenol, and we look forward to further capitalizing on our expanded range of product solutions for the commercial air market long into the future.\nThe industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales in this market grew 25% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. As we continue to see improvements across our diversified industrial markets. In particular, our organic growth was driven by expansions in alternative energy, instrumentation, medical, industrial EV and factory automation, and I'm especially pleased that we grew organically in all of our served geographic regions during the quarter, including in Europe.\nOn a sequential basis, our sales grew by a much better than expected 11% from the first quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we do expect sales to moderate slightly from these second quarter levels on typical seasonality. But we remain encouraged by the company's strength across the many diversified segments of this important market as demand has continued to recover, I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that continue to occur across the industrial market. This creates exciting opportunities for our outstanding team working in this important area.\nThe automotive market represented 14% of our sales in the second quarter, and sales in this market grew 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically as we experienced growth really in all regions. Sequentially, our sales in automotive grew by 7% from the first quarter, which was also much better than our expectations coming into the quarter and really reflected strong execution by our team. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be slightly lower than the second quarter levels as customers plan for their traditional summer shutdowns.\nI remain proud of our team working in the automotive market. While there are still areas of uncertainty in this market, our team continues to be focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. We look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The communications networks represented 11% of our sales in the second quarter Sales grew from prior year by 143% in U.S. dollars, which was driven primarily by the addition of Andrew. On an organic basis, our sales increased by a robust 16% from prior year as we benefited from increased spending by communications networks operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers.\nSequentially, sales in the second quarter grew by 30% from the first quarter driven in part by the Andrew acquisition, which was completed in the first quarter. Organically, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 7%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these very strong Q2 levels. With our expanded range of technology offering, especially following the acquisition of Andrew, we are well positioned with both service provider and OEM customers across the global communications networks market.\nOur deep and broad range of products, coupled with an expansive manufacturing footprint have positioned us to support customers around the world. As those customers continue to drive their systems to higher levels of performance, we look forward to supporting them for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales grew by 14% in U.S. dollars and organically in the second quarter as strength in smartphones and laptops was only partially offset by declines in products sold into tablets.\nSequentially, our sales increased by 4%, which was actually much better than our expectations coming into the quarter for a high teens decline. As we look into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase in the high single digits compared to the strong second quarter levels. I'm very proud of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once enabled us to capture -- once again, enabled us to capture incremental sales in the quarter. I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we're well positioned for the long term.\nAnd finally, the IT datacom market represented 36% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew by a very strong 133% in U.S. dollars and organic. And this was driven by continued acceleration in demand for our products used in artificial intelligence applications, together with continued robust growth in our base IT datacom business. I'm very proud of our team's outstanding execution in the second quarter as we were actually able to outperform even our customers' very high expectations for deliveries of AI-related products. As a result, we shipped substantially more than expected, including some modest portion of third quarter demand.\nIn fact, without this additional output, our IT datacom sales would have represented roughly a similar percentage of overall company sales as we saw in the first quarter or approximately 33%. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a very strong 29% from the first quarter substantially better than our expectation for a high single-digit increase, again, reflecting the outperformance of our team executing beyond what anybody expected. And this growth was driven by sales of AI-related products as well as growth in our base IT datacom -- in our base IT datacom business.\nAs we look into the third quarter and due to the stronger-than-expected execution of our team in the second quarter, we expect our sales to moderate in the high -- in the mid- to high single digits from these very strong second quarter levels. So I got to tell you, we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems with a broad array of customers. And the revolution in AI continues to create unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products.\nIn fact, whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Turning to our outlook and assuming current market conditions as well as constant currency exchange rates, for the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.77 to $0.79. This would represent sales growth from prior year of 34% to 36% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 54% to 58% compared to the third quarter of last year.\nI remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.\nFinally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team for their truly outstanding performance here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nNow, I would like to introduce today's host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2025 conference call. Our first quarter '25 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends, and then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.\nThe company closed the first quarter of 2025 with record sales of $4.811 billion and GAAP and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.58 and $0.63, respectively. First quarter sales were up 40% in U.S. dollars, 49% in local currencies and 33% organically compared to the first quarter of 2024. Sequentially, sales were up 11% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currencies and 6% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were a record $5.292 billion, up a strong 58% compared to the first quarter of 2024 and up 6% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1. GAAP operating income was $1.025 billion the quarter and GAAP operating margin was 21.3%. The GAAP operating income included $5 million of acquisition-related costs, primarily related to the acquisition of OWN and DAS business from CommScope, which closed at the beginning of February. Excluding these acquisition-related costs, net operating income in the first quarter of 2025 was [ $1.130 ] billion, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 20.5%. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 250 basis points from the prior year quarter and 110 basis points sequentially. The increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on our sales volumes, which was modestly offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions.\nOn a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels as well as meaningful progress on profitability improvement initiatives on certain acquisitions. I am very proud of the company's record operating margin performance and which reflects continued strong execution by our teams.\nBreaking down to quarter results by segment compared to the first quarter of 2024, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.268 billion, an increased by [ 5% ] in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, and segment operating margin was 24.5%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $2.414 billion, an increase 91% in U.S. dollars and 73% organically and segment operating margin was 27.4%. Sales in the Interconnect & Sensor Systems segment were $1.129 billion, an increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and operating margin was 18.1%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.7%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 16.7% and 24% in the first quarter of 2024, respectively.\nWe continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24.5% for the full year 2025. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.58 in the first quarter, up 32% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased $0.50 to a record $0.63 to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2024. This was an excellent result.\nOperating cash flow in the first quarter was $765 million or 104% of net income and free cash flow was $580 million or 79% of net income, an excellent result considering the growth we have experienced. We expect to again have somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the second quarter as we continue to invest to support the significant in the IT datacom market. And as we have discussed previously, we have worked with certain customers to support these investments in a variety of ways.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 69 and 59 days, respectively, all within normal levels.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $68. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2025 was approximately [indiscernible] Total debt on March 31 was $7.2 billion, and net debt was $5.5 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was [ $4 ], which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nExcluding acquisition-related costs, first quarter 2025 EBITDA was $1.319 billion. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, our net leverage ratio was 1.2x.\nAs a result of the closing of the acquisition of we now expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $70 million, which is reflected in our second quarter guidance. We are very pleased that the company's financial conditions remain strong by any measure.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and it's a pleasure to welcome you all here on a beautiful spring day in Wallingford, Connecticut, the daffodils are popping, the tulips are up, and we're very excited to report to you at the time of Amphenol's earnings here in the first quarter. I'm going to highlight our first quarter achievements, discuss some trends and progress in our served markets, and then make some comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for questions.\nSo turning to the first quarter, as Craig reviewed. We really drove excellent performance in Q1. Our results were much stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew for a year by 48% in U.S. dollars, 49% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $4.811 billion. On an organic basis, we're very pleased that our sales increased a very strong 33%, with growth across most of our served markets.\nAs Craig alluded to a booked record $5.292 billion in orders in the first quarter was a very healthy book-to-bill of 1.1:1. Orders grew by a very strong 58% prior year and were up 6% sequentially. I would just comment that our orders were really strong across the board with all of our end markets reaching book-to-bills of at least 1:1.\nWe're particularly pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of [ 20.5% ] in the quarter. This was up 250 basis points from prior year and 110 basis points sequentially. There's no doubt that the superior profitability is a direct result of the outstanding execution of the Amphenol around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 58% from prior year to reach a new record of $0.63.\nAnd then finally, we get our earnings into cash, generating strong operating cash flow of $765 million and free cash flow of $580 million in the quarter, both clear reflection of the quality of the company's earnings.\nI just cannot express enough my pride in our team for this quarter's results. These results once again reaffirm the value of the drive, discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic environment.\nNow as we announced on February 3, we also said that we completed the acquisition of CommScope's OWN and DAS businesses, which we are now calling by the company's original name of We're actually very proud to bring back the storied brand back to the company original founding by Victor Andrew in 1937. The acquisition of Angie's Amphenol, an industry-leading folio of innovative and advanced RF antenna and interconnect technologies for the communications networks market. I'm especially excited that we get to welcome the nearly 4,000 talented employees of Andrew to the Amphenol family, and I look forward to further supporting our customers who are developing next-generation wireless networks around the world.\nAs we announced at the time of the listing in February, the Andrew business was expected to generate full year sales of $1.3 billion and approximately $0.06 of accretion to Amphenol in 2025. We're very pleased with the performance of the Andrew team in their first few months as Amphenolians. And accordingly, we now anticipate that the acquisition will add approximately $0.09 to our earnings this full year.\nDuring we also closed on the acquisition of LifeSync, a leading provider of interconnect products for medical applications with net sales of approximately $100 million. As we welcome the outstanding Andrew and LifeSync teams to Amphenol, we remain confident that our AC program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes.\nNow turning to the trends across all of our circuits. I would just note, as usual, that we're very pleased with the company's market exposure because it's -- it remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. I would just note that this diversification continues to create great value for the company It enables us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being overly or disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application.\nSo turning first to the defense market. Our sale -- defense sales represented not of our sales in the quarter, and grew from prior year by a strong 21% in terms of U.S. dollars and 14% organically. This was essentially driven by broad-based growth across virtually all segments within the defense market and importantly, across all geographies. Sequentially, sales grew by 2%, which was a bit better than expectations coming into the quarter.\nAs we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the high single-digit range sequentially, and we remain encouraged by the company's in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry widest range of high-technology products. Amidst the current and very dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our investments in the development of a broad array of new interconnect products as well as the capacity, we are well positioned to capitalize on the term demand potential.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a strong 106% in U.S. dollars as we benefited from the addition of CIT. On an organic basis, sales declined modestly by 3% from prior year as procurement volumes from Jet liner customers moderate. Sequentially, our sales moderated by 4% from the fourth quarter, which actually was a bit better than we had expanding into the quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect our sales to remain roughly at similar levels as in the first quarter.\nI'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth and demand for airliners, our efforts to expand our product, both organically and through our acquisition program have paid real dividends. In particular, I would just tell you very encouraged by the progress of the CIT team as part of Amphenol. And we look forward to further capitalizing on our expanded range of product solutions long into the future.\nThe industrial market represented 20% in the quarter, and our sales increased by 20% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we continue to see improvements across the diversified in the market. In particular, organic growth in the medical, instrumentation, energy and rail mass transit markets more than offset moderations in heavy equipment and factory automation. In addition, our organic growth was driven by expansions in Asia and North America and Europe was down just slightly, a bit better than it had been in the prior quarters.\nOn a sequential basis, sales were up 1% from the fourth quarter, which is better than we had expected coming into the quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to remain at roughly these levels. I would tell you that we remain encouraged company's strength across the many diversified segments of this important market. While demand in Europe has been challenging, I am confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us better than ever to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. This creates exciting opportunities for our outstanding team working in this important area.\nThe automotive market presented 16% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were slightly down by 2% in U.S. dollars and just barely down 1% organically, as growth in North America and Asia was more than offset by a moderation of sales in Europe. Sequentially, our sales were down 3% from the fourth quarter, but this was better than our expectations reflected really strong execution by our team working in the automotive market.\nFor the second quarter, we expect a slight sequential moderation in sales. Despite some near-term challenges and remain proud of our team working in the automotive market. While the market is no doubt uncertain, our team continues to be focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. We look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come.\nNow as I noted last quarter, we have combined now our broadband and mobile networks markets into a new market that we will call communications networks. Our sales in this market primarily go to telco operator and OEM customers across the global communications industry. So the communications network market represented 10% of our sales in the first quarter. And sales grew from prior year by 107%, driven primarily by the addition of Andrew to the Amphenol family. Organic basis, though, sales did increase by $0.11 from prior year, as we benefited from increased spending by communication network operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers.\nSequentially, our sales in the first quarter grew by 81%. That was driven by the Andrew acquisition, and on an organic basis, our sales moderated by 4%, which was better than we had expected. We had come into the quarter expecting a mid-teens sequential decline. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the high teens range sequentially as we benefit from the full quarter addition of Andrew.\nWith our expanded range of technology offerings following acquisition of Andrew, we are well positioned with both service provider and OEM customers across the global communication networks market. Our deep and broad range of products, coupled with an expansion in footprint, have positioned us to support customers wherever they are around the world. And as those customers continue to drive their systems to ever higher levels of performance, we look forward to them for many years to come.\nThe mobile devices market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales grew by 20% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year as strong growth in smartphones, laptops and wearables was only partially offset by a moderation in sales related to tablets. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 26% compared to the typically seasonally stronger fourth quarter. We do believe that some of this outperformance in the firs driven by a slight pull in of demand from certain customers.\nSecond quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high teens as customers adjust production in preparation for product launches in the second half of 2025. I'm very proud of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market, as their agility and reactivity has once again enabled us to capture incremental sales in the quarter. I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms, designed in across a broad range of next-generation devices, we are well positioned for the long term.\nAnd now turning to the IT datacom market. It represented 33% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in the first quarter grew by a very strong 133% in U.S. dollars and 134% organically, and that was really driven by continued acceleration in demand for our products used in artificial intelligence applications, together with continued robust growth in our base IT datacom business. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 34% from the fourth quarter, substantially better than our expectation for a mid-single-digit increase. This growth was driven by sales of AI-related products as well as growth in our base IT datacom business.\nLooking ahead, we expect sales to increase further from these first quarter levels in the high single-digit range as investments in AI-related data centers as well as the underlying IT investments continue to accelerate. Look, we're more encouraged than ever before by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has simply done an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. The revolution in artificial intelligence continues to create a unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. And whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are til components in these next-generation networks. And this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.\nNow turning to our guidance and of course, assuming current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66. This would represent sales growth of 36% to 39% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 45% to 50% compared to the second quarter of 2024. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the mines and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving strong profitability over the long term.\nAnd by I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team of Amphenolians, but they're truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take whatever questions there may be."

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the conference host -- over to your host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2024 conference call.\nOur fourth quarter and full year 2024 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends, then we will, of course, take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.\nThe company closed the fourth quarter of 2024 with record sales of $4.318 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.55, respectively. Fourth quarter sales were up 30% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 20% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nFor full year -- for the full year 2024, sales were $15.223 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 13% organically compared to 2023. Orders in the quarter were a record $5.14 billion, up 58% compared to the prior year and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.16:1. For the full year, orders were $16.835 billion, up 37% compared to 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11:1.\nGAAP operating income was $954 million and included $12 million of acquisition-related costs in the quarter, primarily related to the pending acquisition of the Andrew business from CommScope. GAAP operating margin was a record 22.1%, which increased 140 basis points and 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '23 and the third quarter of '24, respectively. Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of '24 was $966 million, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 22.4%.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 120 basis points from prior year quarter and 50 basis points sequentially. [indiscernible] year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels.\nFor the full year 2024, GAAP operating income was $3.157 billion which included $146 million of acquisition-related costs. Full year GAAP operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to 2023. Excluding acquisition-related costs, full year 2024 adjusted operating income was $3.303 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 21.7%, also a record.\nCompared to 2023, adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points, which was primarily driven by the strong operational performance on the higher sales levels, partially offset by dilutive impact of acquisitions. I am very proud of the company's record operating margin performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams.\nBreaking down the fourth quarter results by segment compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.262 billion, an increase by 40% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, and segment operating margin was 24.2%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.928 billion, an increase by 43% in U.S. dollars and 42% organically, and segment operating margin was 26%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.128 billion, an increase by 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.6%.\nBreaking down full year results by segment compared to the full year 2023. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $4.117 billion -- sorry, $4.417 billion, an increased by 25% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, and segment operating margin was 24.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $6.324 billion, an increased by 29% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically, and segment operating margin was 24.8%. In sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $4.48 billion and increased by 9% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.4%.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.4% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 22% and 24% in the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. For the full year 2024, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 18.9%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 20.7% and 24% in 2023, respectively.\nWe currently expect a 0.5 point increase in our effective tax rate in 2025 compared to 2024, bringing our tax rate to 24.5%. This is primarily driven by our expectation slightly less favorable income mix in 2025, and our first quarter guidance assumes this higher 24.5% tax rate.\nGAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.59 in the fourth quarter, up 44% compared to the prior period and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 34% to a record $0.55 compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was an excellent result. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.92, a 24% increase from $1.55 in 2023 and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $1.89 in 2024, an increase of 25% from $1.51 in 2023.\nOperating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $847 million or 114% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $648 million or 87% of net income. This was an excellent result, especially considering that our capital spending was somewhat elevated in the quarter due to investments we are making in support of the strong growth we are seeing in IT datacom and defense markets. We expect to continue to have somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the first quarter as we continue to invest to support the significant growth we are seeing in the IT datacom market, particularly related to AI applications.\nFor the full year 2024, operating cash flow was a record $2.815 billion or 116% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $2.157 billion in 2024 or 89% of net income, a strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 68 and 58 days, respectively, all within their normal levels.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $70 and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $368 million and $1.280 billion for the full year 2024.\nTotal debt on December 31 was $6.9 billion, and net debt was $3.6 billion, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $3.3 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nUntil the previously announced acquisition of the Andrew business from CommScope closes, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million, which is reflected in our first quarter guidance. We continue to expect the CommScope acquisition to close in the first quarter of 2025.\nExcluding acquisition-related costs, costs, fourth quarter and full year 2024 EBITDA was $1.137 billion and $3.902 billion, respectively. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, our net leverage ratio was 0.9x. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig. [indiscernible] from frozen Wallingford, Connecticut. And I hope all of you stay warm on this very chilly but beautiful winter day.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. I'll then discuss our trends across our served markets. And then -- then I'll comment on our outlook for the first quarter. And of course, we'll have time for questions.\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, the company had a very strong finish to a successful 2024 with sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both exceeding the high end of our guidance here in the fourth quarter. Sales grew by 30% in U.S. dollars and local currencies, reaching a new record of $4.318 billion. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by a very strong 20% with growth across virtually all of our served markets.\nThe company booked just over $5 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, also a new record for the company and representing another strong book-to-bill of 1.16:1. Orders grew by a very strong 58% from prior year and were also up 14% sequentially. These strong orders were once again driven primarily by data center demand related, in particular, to artificial intelligence or AI investments by a number of our large customers.\nWe're pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 22.4% in the quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. I would just say that this superior profitability is a direct result of the outstanding execution of the Amphenol team around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter grew by 34% from prior year and reached a new record of $0.55.\nFinally, the company generated record operating cash flow of $847 million as well as free cash flow of $648 million in the fourth quarter, both the reflections of the quality of the company's earnings.\nI just have to say that I can't express enough my pride in the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reaffirmed the value of the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amidst a very dynamic environment.\nNow turning to the full year of 2024. I just want to say that this is a truly successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 21% in U.S. dollars in local currency and 13% organically, reaching a new sales record of $15.2 billion. As we cross $15 billion in sales in 2024, our organization is proud that we have grown our sales by 40% just in the last 3 years, and this is a great reflection of our organization's ability to navigate market uncertainties while capitalizing on the broad array of opportunities arising across the electronics industry.\nOur full year 2024 adjusted operating margins reached a record 21.7%, an increase of a full 100 basis points from prior year, and this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted EPS of $1.89.\nAnd finally, we generated record operating cash flow of $2.815 billion and free cash flow of $2.157 billion, clear confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management.\nAlso very pleased that our acquisition program again created great value in 2024. We completed the acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, our largest ever, together with the acquisition of Lutze U.S. and Europe. These acquisitions have collectively added annualized sales of more than $1 billion to the company while enhancing Amphenol's position across a broad array of technologies and bring outstanding and talented individuals into our family.\nIn addition, as previously announced, in July, we signed the acquisition for the Andrew business from CommScope. This outstanding acquisition, which we still expect to close here in the first quarter of 2025 will also strengthen the company's position in the global communications market while adding incredible technologies and team members to Amphenol.\nWe returned substantial cash to shareholders in 2024, buying back 11.1 million shares under our share repurchase program and increasing our quarterly dividend by 50%. And this represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.3 billion.\nAs we enter 2025, I remain excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Our agile entrepreneurial organization has created a new position of strength from the company, from which we can continue to drive superior long-term performance.\nNow turning to the trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, all while not being disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application.\nSo turning first to the defense market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year 2024. Sales in the fourth quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 16% in U.S. dollars in local currency. On an organic basis, sales increased by 9%, with broad-based growth across virtually all defense applications, and this included in particular, space, ground vehicles, avionics, airframe and communications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter.\nFor the full year 2024, our sales grew by 15% in U.S. dollars in local currency and by 9% organically, and this reflected our superior operational execution together with growth across really all segments of the defense market. I would just note here that our growth in 2024 was particularly strong in Europe, and that reflected our broad and leading position across the many countries there who are increasing their defense spending.\nLooking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's leading position in the defense interconnect market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology products.\nAmidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our investments in the development of a broad array of new products as well as in the capacities to build them around the world, we're well positioned to capitalize on this long-term demand potential.\nThe commercial air market represented 6% of our sales and for the full year 2024 and in the fourth quarter, sales grew by a strong 137% in U.S. dollars and local currency. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by 18% from prior year and this is really driven by broad-based strength with virtually all commercial aircraft manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales grew as expected by 7% from the third quarter.\nFor the full year 2024, our sales increased by 86% in U.S. dollars in local currency as we benefited from the acquisition of CIT as well as from strong underlying growth in the market. And in fact, organically, our sales increased by 15% from prior year, and that really did reflect our robust design-in position on a broad range of jetliner platforms.\nLooking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high -- mid- to high single-digit range sequentially. I'm just really proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth and demand for aviation, our efforts to expand our product offering, both organically and through our acquisition program are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for our technology offering in this important market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come.\nNow turning to the industrial market. This market represented 23% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year 2024. Our sales in the quarter grew by 26% in U.S. dollars in local currency from prior year. And on an organic basis, we were pleased that sales grew by 6% from prior year with growth in instrumentation, alternative energy, battery electric heavy vehicles, medical as well as rail mass transit applications. On a sequential basis, our sales grew by 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nFor the full year 2024, sales grew by 14% in U.S. dollars in local currency as we benefited from the impact of our acquisitions. Organically, sales declined by 2% from prior year as strength in rail mass transit, alternative energy and medical applications were more than offset by moderations in other markets.\nLooking at the first quarter of 2025, we now expect sales to decline in the low single digits from these fourth quarter levels. I will say that in 2024, despite the overall market moderation, we did continue to expand our range of products and capabilities in service of the diversified global industrial market.\nDemand did moderate in particular, in Europe this year, but we remain encouraged by the company's strength across the many diversified segments of this important market. As demand now begins to improve, I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronics revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market.\nThe automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 20% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down by 3% in U.S. dollars, local currencies and organic, and that was really driven particularly by lower demand from European customers, which more than offset organic growth in North America and Asia. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nFor the full year 2024, our sales increased by 6% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and by 4% organically, and this was driven particularly by strong performance in North America and Asia, which was partially offset by reduced demand in Europe.\nLooking into the first quarter of 2025, we expect a seasonal moderation in sales from this quarter's levels. Just want to say that I'm really proud of our team working in the automotive market. While there are clearly some uncertainties in the market, in particular, in Europe, our team remains focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes everything from electrified drivetrains to a whole multitude of other exciting applications that we're working on. And we look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come.\nThe mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and 9% of our sales for the full year. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew by a robust 15% in U.S. dollar, local currency and organically as strong growth in smartphones, laptops and wearables was only partially offset by a moderation in sales into tablets. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nAnd for the full year, I'm really pleased that our sales in the mobile devices market increased by 11% in U.S. dollars in organically, and this was driven by growth in virtually all mobile device applications.\nAs we look into the first quarter of 2025, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline in the sort of mid-30% range. I'm very proud of our team who's working in the always dynamic and volatile mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once again enabled us to capture incremental sales here in the fourth quarter. And I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices that we're positioned very well for the long term.\nThe IT datacom market represented 27% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 24% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 76% in U.S. dollar, local currency and organically. And this was driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in AI applications together with continued growth in our base IT datacom business. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 17% from the third quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into the quarter. This sequential growth was driven essentially by growth in AI-related applications.\nFor the full year 2024, our sales in the IT datacom market grew by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 56% organically as we benefited from strong demand for AI-related applications as well as growth in our non-AI IT datacom business. Looking ahead, we expect a further mid-single-digit sequential increase in sales in the first quarter as investments in AI-related data centers continue to accelerate.\nWe are more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems particularly those enabling AI. This revolution in AI continues to create a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. And really whether high-speed power or fiber optic, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.\nNow turning to the broadband and the mobile networks markets. I just want to note that with the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope that effective in the first quarter of 2025 and going forward, we will combine the broadband and mobile networks markets into one market that we will refer going forward to as the communications network market.\nThe broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year 2024. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by 10% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency and organic as demand from broadband operators improved. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a very strong 14%, which was well-ahead of our expectations for actually a high single-digit sales decline. For the full year 2024, sales in the broadband market were down by 11% in U.S. dollars, local currency and organically. And that was driven really by a moderation in broadband operator spending.\nThe mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year 2024. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by prior year by a strong 25% in U.S. dollars in local currency and 21% organically as we benefited from increased spending by mobile network operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 4%, but this was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And for the full year 2024, sales grew by 11% from prior year and 5% organically. And this was driven by a strengthening in the mobile networks market, in particular in the second half of the year.\nSo now looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect the newly named communications networks market to see a mid-teens decline in sales from the strong fourth quarter levels. And as a reminder, this guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions that have not yet closed and therefore, excludes the impact of the Andrew acquisition that we still expect to close in the first quarter.\nI would just say that we're very well positioned with customers across the communications networks market and we look forward to continuing to support our OEM and service provider customers in 2025 and beyond. Our teams around the world are working aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation technologies. And we look forward to the increased potential that comes from Amphenol's unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.\nAs we look forward to welcoming the Andrew team to Amphenol, we remain poised to further build on our position as mobility technology innovation continues to accelerate.\nNow turning to our outlook. And obviously, assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. This guidance would represent sales growth for the first quarter -- from the first quarter of 2024 of 23% to 26% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 23% to 28%.\nAnd I would just reiterate here that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.\nAnd finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the fourth quarter and in the full year 2024.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be happy to take any questions."

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2024 conference call. Our second quarter 2024 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends, and then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our recently announced 2-for-1 stock split effective on June 11, 2024, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.610 billion and GAAP and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 and $0.44, respectively.\nSecond quarter sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars, 19% local currencies and 11% organically compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were up 11% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.061 billion, up 33% to the prior year and up 21% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.12:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin were $699 million and 19.4%, respectively, which included $70 million of acquisition-related costs, primarily associated with the CIT acquisition. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was [ $769 ] million, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.3% in the second quarter of '24. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months.\nOn a sequential basis, the modest increase in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the second quarter, particularly CIT which is currently operating well below the company's average profitability levels. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the second quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down second quarter results by segment compared to the second quarter of '23.\nSales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.046 billion an increased by 18% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, and segment operating margin was 24.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.445 billion and increased by 24% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically segment operating margin was 24.3%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.119 billion an increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.2%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.4% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 21.9% and 24% in the second quarter of '23, respectively. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be at 24% in the third quarter and for the full year of '24.\nGAAP adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the second quarter, up 11% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 22% to a record $0.44 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of '23. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $664 million or 120% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $528 million or 95% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong cash flow yield in the quarter despite our slightly increased levels of CapEx. I would note that while our second quarter capital spending was higher than the first quarter, it was still within our normal range. We continue to expect somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support the growth we are seeing in the defense and IT datacom markets.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84, 69 and 56 days, respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $62 when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2024 was more than $320 million. Total debt at June 30 was $5.4 billion, and net debt was $4.1 billion, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion, which included cash and sort of investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nExcluding acquisition-related costs, second quarter 2024 EBITDA was $900 million, and at the end of the second quarter of 2024 our net leverage ratio was 1.2x. As a result of the $1.5 billion U.S. bond offerings completed earlier in the second quarter, and the subsequent closing of CIT in May, we expect quarterly interest expense, net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the third quarter. The company is in a very strong financial position, and we continue to be well positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise.\nIn particular, we are well positioned to fund the pending acquisition of the own and [ DAS ] businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion, which we expect to close by the end of the first half of 2025. We will fund this acquisition through cash on hand and debt. Finally, as mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share effective preferred payments beginning in October of 2024.\nI will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And I hope that you and your family, friends and colleagues are enjoying a very nice summer so far.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our achievements in the second quarter. I will spend a few moments to review our recently closed and announced acquisitions. I'll talk about our trends and progress across our served markets. And then we'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And of course, we'll have some time for questions at the end.\nOur results in the second quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currencies, reaching a new record $3.610 billion. On an organic basis, sales increased by a strong 11% with growth in IT datacom, defense, commercial air, mobile networks, mobile devices and automotive only slightly offset by moderations in the broadband and industrial markets. Importantly, the company booked record orders of $4.061 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.12:1.\nI would just note here that our bookings were particularly strong from IT datacom customers focused on artificial intelligence or AI. Adjusted operating margins reached a record 21.3% in the second quarter, a strong 90 basis point increase from last year's second quarter and adjusted diluted EPS grew 22% from prior year to a record $0.44. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $664 million and $528 million, respectively, both clear demonstrations of the high quality of the company's earnings. And finally, as Craig mentioned, we announced this morning a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective with our October dividend payment. Just want to say how proud I am of our team here this quarter as the results that they drove once again reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic environment.\nAs you know, our M&A team has once again been very busy of late, I'm very pleased to announce that on May 21 we closed the previously announced acquisition of CIT previously called Carlyle Interconnect Technologies. I'm very excited to welcome the talented CIT team to the Amphenol family, and we really look forward to realizing the benefits of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary product solutions, which will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across the important commercial air defense and industrial markets.\nIn addition, we're pleased to have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Lutze. Lutze is a leading provider of harsh environment, cable and cable assembly solutions for high technology applications in the industrial markets. This acquisition includes 2 businesses: Lutze US based in North Carolina and Lutze Europe based in Germany. In May, we did close on the acquisition of Lutze US, which has annual sales of approximately $75 million. And we expect to close on Lutze Europe, which has annual sales of approximately $100 million by the end of the third quarter of 2024. That's this quarter here.\nLutze acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market and in particular, strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products. Finally, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire the Mobile Networks related businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion. We're really excited to be acquiring CommScope's Outdoor Wireless Networks or OWN and distributed antenna systems or DAS businesses. These businesses provide exciting mobile network solutions with advanced technologies in the areas of base station antennas and related interconnect solutions as well as distributed antenna systems.\nI just want to mention that we're especially encouraged that the businesses that we're acquiring really make up the former Andrew Corporation portfolio of products, a company with a rich history of innovation and technology in the wireless industry. These businesses are expected to generate revenues of approximately $1.2 billion with EBITDA margins of approximately 25% in 2024. This represents operating margins in the high teens, including our current estimate of post acquisition-related amortization. We really look forward to supporting customers who are developing next-generation wireless networks around the world with these advanced solutions as well as with our own existing complementary interconnect products. Most importantly, we look forward to welcoming the approximately 4,000 employees of these businesses around the world.\nThere's no doubt in my mind that these talented individuals will make great future Amphenolians. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, and we look forward to the future closings of Lutze Europe and CommScope, OWN and DAS, we remain confident that Amphenol's acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nNow turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application.\nSo with that said, the defense market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter Sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 14% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, driven in part by the earlier-than-anticipated closing of CIT.\nLooking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range from the second quarter levels, including the benefit of acquisitions. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. With the addition now of CIT's highly complementary products to our portfolio, we're better positioned than ever to support our customers with new products and the capacity to supply them wherever they may be needed.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. We had another strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 60% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically from prior year as we benefited from the addition of CIT during the quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Sequentially, our sales grew by 46% in U.S. dollars from the first quarter as we benefited from the addition of CIT. On an organic basis, our sales were flat sequentially, which was a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the quarter.\nLooking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-40% range as we benefit particularly from a full quarter of CIT sales. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. Now with the addition of CIT, we offer the broadest range of high-technology interconnect products to our customers in this important area. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus the demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come.\nThe industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and sales in the second quarter did grow 9% in U.S. dollars from prior year as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5% as we saw moderations in most segments on a year-over-year basis of the industrial market.\nSequentially, sales grew by a better-than-expected 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by acquisitions, but our organic sales were up slightly on a sequential basis. Looking at the third quarter, we expect sales to grow in the mid-single-digit range sequentially, driven by the benefit of our recent acquisitions. While the industrial market certainly has been experiencing a pause as customers and distributors have adjusted their demand levels, we are encouraged to see some early signs of momentum growing in certain areas of the industrial market. In addition, with the additions this quarter of CIT and Lutze US, we now have an ever broaden -- an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. This creates opportunities long term for our outstanding team working in this market.\nThe automotive market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew 6% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically, driven by strength across newer automotive applications. Sequentially, our sales moderated by 4% from the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. I would note that we did see some incremental softening of demand in Europe in the quarter. As vehicle manufacturers there moderated their production volumes, and that was offset by a more favorable performance in North America and Asia. For the third quarter, we do expect sales to be slightly down from these levels as certain automakers have slowed their summer production schedules.\nI'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. We look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically as strength in smartphones and wearables and more than offset moderations in sales related to laptops.\nSequentially, our sales increased by 9% which [ was ] much better than our expectations for a mid-single-digit decline and we really did see sequential growth across all segments of the mobile devices market, which was encouraging.\nLooking into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 20% from the second quarter levels as customers prepare for year-end new product launches. While mobile devices will always remain Amphenol's most volatile of end markets, our outstanding and agile team remains well positioned to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 13% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically as we did see the beginning of a recovery in our sales to network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers after a number of quarters of demand moderation.\nSequentially, sales in the quarter increased by a strong 22%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we do expect some moderation from the strong second quarter levels on traditional summer seasonality. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market as operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems. Our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. Now with the pending acquisition of the OWN and DAS businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these next-generation networks for years to come. The IT datacom market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 56% organically, driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in next-generation AI data centers. While the vast majority of this growth did result from our expanding position in AI Interconnect.\nWe were encouraged to also see some improvements in base IT datacom demand. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a strong 29% from the first quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into Q2. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to grow modestly from these elevated second quarter levels. We're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol. Given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning, driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology of interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.\nFinally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did decline by 17% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat as we had anticipated. And looking into the third quarter, we expect a further moderation of sales sequentially. Regardless of this current muted demand environment, we do remain encouraged by the company's continued strong position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world. As they eventually increase their spending to increase network coverage and bandwidth in support of the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.\nNow turning to our outlook and assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant currency exchange rates. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.45. This would represent sales growth of 16% to 19% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. As is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed but does include CIT and Lutze US, both of which are currently operating below the corporate average level of profitability. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment while continuing to grow Amphenol's market position and driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.\nAnd finally, I just want to take this opportunity here to thank our entire global team for what were truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be more than happy to take any questions."

[Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, and you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2024 conference call. Our first quarter 2024 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. Then we will take questions. .\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make some forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of [ 3.256 ] billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. First quarter sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 6% organically compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and 4% organically.\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were [ $3.348 ] billion, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and 66% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $685 million, and operating margin was 21% in the first quarter of 2024.\nOn a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points compared to the first quarter of '23 and 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '23. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and decreased by 20 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months.\nOn a sequential basis, the modest decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected better-than-typical conversion on the lower sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance, which reflects the continued strong execution of our teams. Breaking down the first quarter results by segment relative to the first quarter of 2023, sales in Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $916 million and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were [ $1.266 ] billion and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.6%. Sales in the Interconnect and sensor Systems segment, were $1.075 billion increased by 8% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.2%.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.7%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 20.9% and 24% in the first quarter of 2023, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.87 in the first quarter of '24, up 23% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 16% to $0.80 compared to $0.69 in the first quarter of '23. This was an excellent result. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $599 million or 120% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $506 million or 101% of adjusted net income.\nWe are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong free cash flow yield in the quarter. I would note here that we may see slightly elevated levels of CapEx in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support some of the growth that we are seeing in certain markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventories days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 70 and 53 days, respectively, all within the normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $108. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of '24 was $286 million.\nDuring the month of April, the company repurchased the remaining authorized amount of stock under its existing $2 billion stock repurchase plan, thus completing the plan. And as noted in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year open-market stock repurchase plan. Total debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nFirst quarter 2024 EBITDA was $810 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2024, our net leverage was 0.7x. Following the close of the quarter in April, the company used $350 million in cash on hand to repay its maturing 3.2% U.S. senior notes and our $750 million undrawn term loan matured and was not renewed. In addition, in early April, we completed a $1.5 billion U.S. bond offering, and the company intends to use the net proceeds from the bond offering, together with cash on hand and other debt financing to fund the company's pending acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, which we continue to expect to close by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\nAs a result of the U.S. bond offering, we do expect quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $55 million, although until CIT is closed, we also expect interest income generated from the increased cash balance to offset the increase in interest expense. As such, the impact on earnings will be relatively usual until the CIT closing occurs. The company is in a very strong financial position, and we are well positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my warmest welcome to all of you here from beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, where spring is certainly in the air. As you know, as is typical, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified markets. Finally, I'll comment on the outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for questions. .\nOur results in the first quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We're very pleased that our sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies, reaching $3.256 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 6% with growth in IT datacom, commercial air, automotive, defense and mobile devices markets, somewhat offset by declines in the mobile networks, broadband and industrial markets.\nAnd I'll talk about each of those markets here in a few moments. We're very pleased that the company booked $3.348 billion in orders in the first quarter and that, that represented a positive book-to-bill of 1.03:1. Our profitability was very strong in the quarter, and adjusted operating margins reached 21% even in the quarter, a robust 90 basis point increase from last year's levels. And from that profitability, we generated adjusted diluted EPS, which grew 16% from prior year to $0.80.\nFinally, we generated strong operating and free cash flow of $599 million and $506 million, another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. As Craig mentioned, we're very pleased that the Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year stock repurchase program, and this represents another important component of the company's balanced capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians. The company's results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well in the most dynamic of environment.\nNow as we announced on January 30, just after our Q4 earnings, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire Carlisle Interconnect Technologies business for $2 billion in cash. CIT as it is known, is a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions primarily to the commercial air, defense and industrial end markets, with approximately 6,000 employees worldwide. The company's wide range of products, including wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors are highly complementary to Amphenol's existing interconnect and sensor solutions.\nAs previously announced, CIT is expected to have annual sales of approximately $900 million in 2024 with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. We do continue to anticipate that the transaction will be completed by the end of this second quarter. Accordingly and based on CIT's current operating performance, we do expect this acquisition to add roughly $0.02 to earnings in the second half of 2024, excluding acquisition-related costs.\nAs we look forward to welcoming the outstanding CIT team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions really of all sizes, and to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes.\nNow turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we continue to be pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application.\nSo starting out with the defense market. This important market represents 11% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales were down by 2%, and this was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products.\nAmidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're well positioned to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a strong 20%, both in U.S. dollars and organically and that was really driven by broad-based strength across virtually all aircraft applications.\nSequentially, our sales grew much better than expected, 11% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect a modest reduction in sales versus these very strong first quarter levels. I'm just really proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends for the company.\nWe continue to see great, long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market, including with the CIT acquisition and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in this market did decline by 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. During the quarter, we did see some growth in marine, public safety, rail mass transit and oil and gas applications, but that was more than offset by moderating performance, particularly in battery and electric heavy vehicles, instrumentation and factory automation.\nOn a sequential basis, we were pleased that sales were up 6% from the fourth quarter a bit better than our expectations, but that growth was really driven by our acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as here in the first quarter. And despite this near-term positive demand, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market.\nThe automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the first quarter. And sales in the first quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including especially communications-related applications as well as electric and hybrid electric vehicle drivetrains. Sequentially, our sales declined by 3% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations, and that reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market.\nAs we head into the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales. But I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued and clear outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And while that includes electrified drivetrains, it also includes a multitude of other exciting applications. And we look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come.\nThe mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales were flat from prior year in U.S. dollars, but grew 2% organically as growth in laptops and smartphones was offset by declines in tablets, wearables and other products. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 29% compared to the fourth quarter. As we head into the second quarter, we now expect a mid-single-digit sales decline from these first quarter levels as customers prepare for new model launches in the second half of 2024.\nWhile mobile devices will no doubt always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did decline from prior year by 13% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers.\nSequentially though, we were pleased to see that our sales did grow by 5% from the fourth quarter, as we had expected, coming into Q1. And as we look into the second quarter, we now expect a high single-digit increase in sales, which does reflect some increased demand that we are seeing from our mobile operator customers. While no doubt the short-term investment environment in the mobile networks market has been challenging, I can just tell you that our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.\nWhen customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're poised to build on that position as wireless technology continues to accelerate long into the future. The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales in the first quarter grew by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically, and this was driven by accelerating demand for our products used in artificial intelligence data centers. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 1% from the fourth quarter, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-single-digit decline. We continue to experience strong orders for AI-related interconnect products. And accordingly, as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double-digit range from these first quarter levels. I can tell you that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market.\nOur team continues to do a really outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, this revolution in AI that we're all living through right now has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future.\nAnd whether it's high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and that just creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for the company. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 19% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat, which was slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we anticipate sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels.\nYes, regardless of the current demand dynamics in broadband, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.\nNow turning to our outlook and of course, assuming current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates, for the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.24 billion to $3.30 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. This would represent sales growth of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% compared to the second quarter of last year.\nI just wanted to note that as is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed, including CIT. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I'd just like to take, again, this opportunity to thank the entire global team of Amphenolians around the world, nearly 100,000 of them worldwide for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now introduce your conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and welcome you to our Fourth Quarter of '23 Conference Call.\nOur Fourth Quarter and full year '23 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.\nThe company closed the Fourth Quarter with sales of $3,327 million and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82. Fourth Quarter sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and down 1% organically compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year of '23, sales were $12.555 million down 50 basis points in U.S. dollars, flat in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2022.\nOrders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 10% compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95 to 1. For the full year, orders were $12,267 million, down 5% compared to 2022, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.9821. GAAP operating income and operating margin was $690 million and 20.7%, respectively, in the Fourth Quarter of '23 which increased 10 basis points compared to both the Fourth Quarter of '22 and the Third Quarter of '23.\nAdjusted operating income was $706 million, which excluded $16 million in acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating margin was 21.2% during the Fourth Quarter and a new quarterly record for the company. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 30 basis points compared to the Fourth Quarter of '22, and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on slightly higher sales levels as well as the benefit of pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, most of which are currently operating below the corporate average.\nFor the full year of 2023, GAAP operating income was $2.56 billion, which included $35 million of acquisition-related costs and excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $2.594 million. For the full year of '23, GAAP operating margin was 20.4% and adjusted operating margin was a strong 20.7%, consistent with our previous annual record margins achieved in 2022 and 2018. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased 10 basis points compared to 2022. Compared to 2022, adjusted operating margin was flat, which primarily was driven by strong operational performance as well as the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was an impressive margin performance given the slight sales decline we experienced in 2023.\nOur team continued to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down Fourth Quarter results by segment relative to the Fourth Quarter of 2022 and Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $900 million and increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.345 billion and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 23.1%.\nSales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.082 billion and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.5%. Breaking down full year results by segment relative to 2022. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $3.531 billion, an increase by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $4.913 billion and declined by 13% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 21.6%. Sales in interconnect and System Sensor Systems segment were $4.111 billion, an increase by 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.3%.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the Fourth Quarter was 22% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 19.2% and 24.5% in the Fourth Quarter of 2022, respectively. And for the full year of '23, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to $22.3 million and 24.5% in 2022, respectively. In 2024, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. I GAAP diluted EPS was $0.83 in the Fourth Quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 5% to a record $0.82 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of '22. This was an excellent result.\nFor the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $3.11, a [ 2% ] increase from $36 in 2022. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.01 in 2023, an increase from $3 in 2022. Operating cash flow in the Fourth Quarter was a record $842 million or 162% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $739 million or 142% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver such a strong cash flow yield in the quarter and for the full year. In the full year, 2023 operating cash flow was a record $2.529 billion or 130% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2023 was a record $2.160 billion or 111% of adjusted net income, a very strong result.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 70 and 55 days, respectively, all within our normal levels. And during the quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86 bringing total repurchases during 2023 to 7.2 million shares or $585 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2023 was $1.86 billion.\nTotal debt on December 31 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.7 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Fourth Quarter and full year 2023 EBITDA was $830 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the Fourth Quarter of 2023, our net leverage was 0.9x. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. And I hope it's not too late to wish all of you a happy New Year here from Wallingford, Connecticut. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the Fourth Quarter and also for the full year of 2023. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some comments on our outlook for the First Quarter, and then, of course, we'll have time for questions.\nOur results in the Fourth Quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies, reaching $3.327 billion. On an organic basis, our sales did decline by just 1%, with growth in commercial air, defense, automotive and IT datacom markets offset by declines across our other end markets. The company booked $3.164 billion in orders in the Fourth Quarter. This was a 10% growth versus prior year and flat to last quarter, but did represent a book-to-bill of 0.95 to 1.\nWe're very pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 21.2% in the quarter, a clear reflection of our team's outstanding execution and these margins increased 30 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.82 in the quarter, representing a growth of 5% from prior year. I have to say that we were especially pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $842 million and $739 million, respectively, in the Fourth Quarter both just really clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings.\nI come out of the Fourth Quarter, extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased that we announced this morning that we closed 4 acquisitions in the quarter, really in November and December. Based in Ohio, TPC wire and cable is a value-added provider of harsh environment, cable and cable assemblies for applications across the industrial market and this includes particularly factory automation and heavy equipment and TPC has annual sales of roughly $110 million.\nHeadquartered in New Hampshire and with annual sales of approximately $90 million [ Era ] is a leading provider of sensors for the recreational marine, commercial fishing and industrial markets. [ LED ] technologies based in [ Talus ] France has annual sales of approximately $40 million and LID is a high-technology supplier of sensor products to the industrial and automotive markets with a focus on tire pressure monitoring and the telematics associated with that. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of PCTEL, a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, including in particularly the Internet of Things or industrial IoT market. PCTEL generated in 2023, approximately $85 million in sales.\nAs we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our acquisition program was very successful in 2023 and our pipeline of prospective deals remain strong as we enter the new year. Indeed, we continue to see interesting near-term potential opportunities to bring outstanding and complementary organizations into the Amphenol family. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes.\nNow turning to the full year of 2023, despite the demand challenges that we did experience in certain end markets in the year, I have to say that the Amphenol team delivered another successful year of performance. Amidst significant organic declines in the communications end markets due to inventory builds in 2022 as well as the more recent moderations in demand in the industrial market. Our team was able to deliver overall sales that were only slightly down from prior year. This was a testament to the breadth and diversification of the company as well as our team's ability to capitalize in real time on opportunities for incremental sales across the entirety of our markets.\nOur full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 20.7% was flat with our last year record levels in 2022 despite the organic sales decline. This excellent performance by our team allowed us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $3.01 which was just slightly above prior year levels. We also generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.529 billion and $2.160 billion, respectively, both confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program, which I just discussed really created a great value throughout the year with 10 new companies contributing annualized sales of more than $600 million joining Amphenol in 2023.\nThese new acquisitions enhanced our position across a broad array of technologies while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're excited that these companies represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance and have deepened our already strong bench of leaders around the world. In addition, in 2023, we bought back over 7 million shares under our share buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, and that represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.1 billion. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility across the overall market environment in 2023, as we enter 2024, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance.\nNow turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad with no end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2023. This market diversity helps to insulate us from the effect of any given market volatility while also exposing us to the exciting revolutions happening across the electronics industry.\nTurning first to the defense market. Our sales represented 12% of our total in the Fourth Quarter and 11% for the full year 2023. Fourth Quarter sales once again grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. On an organic basis, sales in the defense market increased by 15%, with broad-based growth across virtually all defense applications, particularly strong in naval helicopters communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 4% from the Third Quarter.\nFor the full year 2023, sales in the defense market grew by 20% in U.S. dollars in local currency and by 18% organically. This reflected our operational execution as well as broad strength across most segments of the defense market, and that particularly related to naval, aircraft engine, helicopter, communications and space-related applications.\nLooking ahead, we expect sales in the First Quarter to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially, and we remain very encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market. where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We are well positioned to accelerate our new product development and increase our capacity to support this demand long into the future.\nThe commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year 2023. In the Fourth Quarter, our sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 1% from the Third Quarter, which was actually ahead of our expectations for a modest seasonal decline. For the full year 2023, sales increased by a very robust 36% in U.S. dollar local currency and organically, reflecting our strong design-in positions on a broad range of platforms as well as broad-based demand across all aircraft applications.\nLooking into the First Quarter, we expect sales to remain at these lofty Fourth Quarter levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market. and look forward to realizing the benefits of those growth initiatives for many years to come.\nThe industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and 25% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the Fourth Quarter did decline by 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currencies and 12% organically as growth that we realized in oil and gas, rail mass transit and marine applications, was more than offset by moderations in demand in other segments, including battery and electric heavy vehicles, building automation, transportation and heavy equipment. In addition, our sales into the industrial distribution channel continued to be more muted than they were a year ago. On a sequential basis, sales grew by 1%, but that was driven primarily by acquisitions that we did close in the quarter.\nFor the full year 2023, sales were flat in U.S. dollars in local currency and declined by 7% organically as the contribution from acquisitions was offset by weakness in instrumentation, battery [ Eve ] and electric heavy vehicles, factory automation and heavy equipment applications in particular. Looking into the First Quarter, we expect sales to remain at these levels as the benefit of recent acquisitions offset the modest organic sequential decline. Despite this near-term demand pause driven in particular by elevated inventory levels, both in the distribution channel as well as in certain end markets, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market.\nWe are very excited by the additions of TPC, [ Arm ], LID and PCTEL, each of which adds complementary new interconnect sensor and antenna technologies to our industrial product offering. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect and tenant sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and 23% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the Fourth Quarter grew by a robust 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency, and on an organic basis, our sales to the automotive market increased by 12%. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 8%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nFor the full year 2023, I'm pleased that our sales increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars 13% in local currency and 12% organically, and that reflected broad strength across the automotive market, including, in particular, next-generation electronics, for example, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2024, we expect a high single-digit sequential seasonal moderation in sales in the First Quarter from these levels.\nI'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance in 2023 is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. It's really a multitude of applications, including electrified drivetrains, but not just that, many other applications. We look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come.\nThe mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and 10% of our sales for the full year 2023. Our Fourth Quarter sales moderated by 3% in U.S. dollars, local currency and organic as robust growth in smartphones was once again more than offset by declining sales into tablets, laptops and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9% which was much better than our expectation coming into the quarter for a high single-digit decline. For the full year 2023, sales in the mobile devices market declined by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declines in other mobile device applications.\nLooking into the First Quarter, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain 1 of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market declined from prior year by 26% in U.S. dollars, 27% in local currency and 34% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 6%, which was in line with our expectations. For the full year, sales declined by 26% from prior year and 32% organically driven by the spending reductions that we've discussed throughout the year.\nLooking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales from these Fourth Quarter levels. And despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year.\nWe're very pleased that our sales in the Fourth Quarter returned to growth compared to prior year, with sales in U.S. dollars and local currency increasing by 6% and organically by 5%. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much better-than-expected 6%. As we continue to benefit from our strong presence with AI data center customers as well as some overall improved demand. For the full year 2023, our sales in the IT datacom market declined 13% in U.S. dollars and organically as strong demand for AI-related applications was more than offset by inventory adjustments that we saw amongst our traditional IT datacom applications.\nLooking ahead, we do expect in the First Quarter a mid-single-digit sequential seasonal decline in sales. I have to say coming out of what was a challenging year in the overall IT datacom market that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this space. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling artificial intelligence. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we are very well positioned for the future. This creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the year.\nSales in the Fourth Quarter were down 31% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by 12%, which was worse than our expectations coming into the quarter when we anticipated more of a modest increase. For the full year 2023, sales were down by 7% in U.S. dollars and organically driven by the continued pause in broadband operator spending. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the First Quarter to increase modestly from these levels.\nRegardless of the current demand dynamics, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.\nAnd finally, turning to our outlook. There's no doubt that the current economic environment remains somewhat uncertain. Assuming the continuation of these current market conditions and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the First Quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.40 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% to 6% compared to the First Quarter of 2023. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world, including all of those who work across our factories, touch our products, and ultimately deliver to our customers what they need. I'm just truly grateful for all of their outstanding efforts both here in the Fourth Quarter, but moreover, for the entirety of 2023, without them, we wouldn't be able to make it happen like we do. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Our third quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.\nThe company closed the third quarter with sales of $3.199 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and $0.78, respectively. Third quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and 5% organically compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nSequentially, sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars, local currencies and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were [ $3.164 billion ], which was flat compared to the third quarter of '22 and up 4% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99:1. GAAP operating income was $658 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $9 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $667 million.\nGAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.6% and 20.8%, respectively, in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of '22 and increased by 30 basis points sequentially.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased by just 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of '22 but increased by 40 basis sequentially. This modest year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, which are currently operating well below the corporate average.\nOn an organic basis, we were very pleased with our operating margin performance, which represented a smaller-than-typical downside conversion on the lower organic sales levels. This strong organic performance reflected the agility of our team in adjusting costs as well as the continued benefit of pricing actions taken in the prior year.\nOn a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continued to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world.\nBreaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of '22, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $887 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.9%.\nSales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.279 billion and declined by 16% in the U.S. dollars inorganically. Segment operating margin was 22.1%.\nSales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.033 billion, an increase by 5% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.3%.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.1% and 24.5% in the third quarter of '22, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was up 4% at $0.83 compared to $0.80 in the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.78 compared to $0.80 in the third quarter of '22. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter.\nOperating cash flow in the third quarter was $618 million or 128% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $544 million or 112% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87, 70 and 52 days, respectively, all within the normal levels. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.22 effective for payments beginning in January of 2024.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders during the third quarter of '23 was approximately $275 million.\nTotal debt on September 30 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nThird quarter 2023 EBITDA was $784 million. And at the end of the third quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.8x. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. And I hope that you're all having an enjoyable fall so far. It's a pleasure here in Wallingford to see the beautiful orange and red hues out of our windows.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our diversified end markets, and then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023.\nTurning to the third quarter. Our results in the third quarter were better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales declined by 3% in U.S. dollars and local currencies, reaching just under $3.2 billion with growth in the commercial air, military and automotive end markets as well as contributions from our acquisitions, which were more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, mobile devices, IT datacom, broadband and industrial end markets.\nOn an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, but sales did increase sequentially by 5% from second quarter levels. We're pleased that the company booked orders of $3.164 billion, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.99:1. I'm especially encouraged that our orders in the third quarter did exceed prior year levels, and that's an encouraging sign going forward.\nProfitability was very strong in the quarter. We generated adjusted operating margins of 20.8%, and that was down just 20 basis points from prior year. Sequentially, our margins improved by 40 basis points. And as Craig already mentioned, these operating margins in the third quarter reflected just outstanding execution by our global management team, who continue to manage dynamically and effectively even in the face of moderating sales.\nAdjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.78, and that declined just 3% from prior year and increased by a strong 8% on a sequential basis. And then finally, we're very pleased with the company's cash flow generation in the quarter with operating and free cash flow of $618 million and $544 million, respectively, in the third quarter, clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings.\nI come out of this quarter extremely proud of the team. And I'll just say that our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the dynamic and challenging environment.\nOur acquisition team has been extremely busy this year so far. And I'm really pleased that since our last earnings call, we've closed on 3 acquisitions: Connor Manufacturing, Q Microwave and XMA Corporation. In addition, we signed an agreement to acquire PCTEL.\nWith its headquarters in Illinois, Connor is a global manufacturer of power interconnect products, including especially high-voltage busbars for the automotive and industrial markets with annual sales of approximately $100 million. Based in California, Q Microwave is a designer and manufacturer of mission-critical radio frequency components utilized in military platforms with annual sales of approximately $20 million.\nAnd based in New Hampshire, XMA is also a provider of RF components for the military as well as the IT datacom market with annual sales of approximately $15 million. We're very pleased that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire PCTEL. PCTEL is a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets as well as purpose-built industrial IoT products and test and measurement solutions. We expect the PCTEL transaction to close by early 2024.\nI'm very excited to welcome the Connor, Q Microwave and XMA teams to Amphenol. And I certainly look forward to welcoming the PCTEL team once that deal closes.\nMost importantly, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into our entrepreneurial organization, this remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol.\nNow turning to our served markets. We're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. And that creates great value for the company, particularly amidst these dynamic times.\nSo turning to each of our served markets. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically. And this is really driven by broad-based strength across virtually every segment of the military market.\nSequentially, our sales grew by 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these robust third quarter levels. And for the full year of 2023, we expect a high teens increase in sales from prior year.\nWith the acquisitions last quarter of both Q Microwave and XMA, we further broadened our industry-leading RF product offering into this important defense market. And in general, we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position across the defense industry, where we continue to offer the market's widest range of high-technology interconnect products.\nAmidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're going to continue to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity and thus are well positioned to support this increased demand long into the future.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, had another really strong quarter with sales increasing by a very robust 40% from prior year and 37% organically. And this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications.\nOn a sequential basis, sales did decline by just 1%, and that was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest seasonal sequential decline in sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase in the mid-30% range compared to 2022.\nI'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives for many years to come.\nThe industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter did decline by 6% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically as growth in medical, oil and gas and rail mass transit applications was more than offset by declines in other segments of the industrial market.\nI did want to highlight that our sales into the distribution channel were particularly soft in the third quarter as many distributors have taken steps to reduce their inventory positions in the industrial market. Sequentially, sales declined by 4% from the second quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nLooking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to be roughly flat versus prior year as some organic moderations are offset by the benefit of our acquisitions.\nDespite this near-term demand pause in the industrial market, I continue to remain so proud of our outstanding global team working in this important area. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many exciting segments of this truly diverse market, and I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market.\nThe automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. And sales grew by a very robust 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. This was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle platforms.\nSequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the second quarter, and this was much better than our expectations that we had coming into 3Q. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And for the full year of 2023, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% compared to prior year.\nI'm really proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles, including electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting new applications.\nWith the addition of Connor to the Amphenol family, we now have an even broader array of products for global electric vehicle manufacturers. And we look forward to benefiting from this position for many years to come.\nThe mobile device market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales moderated by 20% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales of products that are incorporated into laptops, tablets and wearables.\nOn a sequential basis, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 25%. And that was really driven by higher-than-expected sales in smartphones and wearables. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high single digits sequentially as strong growth in smartphones we expect to be more than offset by continued declines in laptops and wearables. For the full year, we anticipate sales to decline in the mid-teens compared to 2022.\nWhile there's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile end market, our team once again in the third quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the end of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage their leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond.\nThe mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 35% in U.S. dollars and 43% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers.\nOn a sequential basis, our sales declined by 6%, which was a bit worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline in the mid- to high single digits sequentially. And for the full year, we anticipate a moderation in sales in the sort of mid-20% range versus 2022.\nDespite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed investments in these next-generation systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from Amphenol's unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.\nThe IT datacom market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And while sales did decline by 12% in U.S. dollars inorganically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually much better than we had expected 90 days ago.\nIn fact, on a sequential basis, our sales increased by a strong 13% in the third quarter, much better than previous expectations. The growth in our sales from the second quarter was driven by an accelerating surge in demand from customers who are making significant investments in AI data centers.\nWe also continued to see robust orders for AI-related applications, a confirmation of our team's success in positioning Amphenol as a leader in the complex interconnect systems that support alternative intelligence or artificial intelligence. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain at these third quarter levels. And for the full year of 2023, we expect the mid-teens decline in sales compared to prior year.\nWhile we've certainly had to manage through the inventory adjustments in the broader IT market, I am more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom industry. This revolution in AI is creating a true and unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning applications driving a more intensive usage of our highest technology interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future.\nIn addition, our team just continues to do an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for the company.\nFinally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales were down 8% in U.S. dollars and organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels.\nOn a sequential basis, sales were down by 6%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a modest sequential increase in sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to decline in the mid-single digits from prior year.\nRegardless of the current demand dynamics, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, we're very well positioned to benefit from the broad array of government-funded initiatives, particularly in North America, thereby giving us confidence for the future.\nNow turning to our outlook. There's no question that the current economic environment remains uncertain. And assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.15 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. This would represent a sales decline of 3% to 5% and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 1% to 4% compared to prior year.\nOur fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full year sales of $12.317 billion to $12.377 billion and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.94 and to $2.96. This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted EPS declines of 2% and 1% to 2%, respectively.\nI'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while also driving strong profitability. In addition, I just want to reiterate that our entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would like to finally take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our 90,000 employees around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

    "content": "Q2 2023 Amphenol Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2023 Amphenol Corp Earnings Call\n\nAPHNYSEJUL 26, 1:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nHello, and welcome to the second quarter earnings conference call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amphenol Corp.\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Our second quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.\nThe company closed the second quarter with sales of $3,054 million and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 and $0.72, respectively. Second quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and organically -- and 4% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were $3,044 million, which was down 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022, but up 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. GAAP operating income was $620 million in the second quarter of 2023, which included $4 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $624 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.3% and 20.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of '22, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. And on an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially.\nThis modest year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong downside conversion on the sales -- lower sales volumes as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating below the corporate average. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels.\nOur team continues to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. During the second quarter, we were excited to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of RFS. The value of the net assets we acquired were in excess of the RFS purchase price. And as a result, we recorded a noncash gain of $5 million in the second quarter, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. In the third quarter of 2023, we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with RFS, which we estimate will be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. These costs will be excluded from our third quarter adjusted EPS results and are excluded from our Q3 2023 guidance.\nBreaking down second quarter results by segment, relative to the second quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $889 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 27%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1,162 million and declined by 16% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 20.5%.\nSales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1,003 million and increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.5%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 23.3% and 24.5% in the second quarter of 2022, respectively.\nGAAP diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.74 compared to $0.76 in the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased -- decreased 4% to $0.72 compared to $0.75 in the second quarter of 2022.\nOperating cash flow in the second quarter was $536 million or 120% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $442 million or nearly 100% of adjusted net income. We are very pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87, 71 and 48 days, respectively. Through the focused attention of our management team during the quarter, we were able to bring inventory days back in line with our normal range.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $77. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023 was $280 million. Total debt on June 30 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.8 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nSecond quarter 2023 EBITDA was $736 million, and at the end of the second quarter of '23, our net leverage ratio was 0.9x. We are very pleased that the company's financial position remains extremely strong by any measure.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amphenol Corp.\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today on this beautiful summer day here in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I do hope that all of you on the call, together with your family, friends and colleagues are enjoying a little bit of your summer thus far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'll then spend a moment to discuss our trends and the progress across our served markets and make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And then obviously, we'll have time for questions at the end.\nWith respect to the second quarter, our results were better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales declined 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency reaching $3,054 million, with growth in commercial air, military and automotive end markets as well as contributions from our acquisitions, slightly more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, IT datacom and mobile devices segments. On an organic basis, sales did decline by 4%. We're very pleased that the company booked orders in the quarter of $3.44 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of 1:1.\nAs Craig described, our margins in the quarter, adjusted operating margins were 20.4%, which was down 30 basis points from prior year, but which improved by 30 basis points from the first quarter sequentially. I'm very pleased that our margins in the second quarter once again reflected outstanding execution by our global management team, who continue to quickly adjust to changing demand and costs amidst these very dynamic times.\nAdjusted diluted EPS in the quarter of $0.72 declined 4% from prior year but increased 4% from the sequential prior quarter. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow of $536 million and $442 million in the second quarter, yet another demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings.\nI'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of our Amphenolian entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment.\nWe're pleased to announce today that we closed the previously announced acquisition of the North American cable and global base station antenna business of RFS. Despite some current moderation in the mobile networks market, we remain excited about the long-term prospects of RFS as part of the Amphenol family. We now expect this acquisition to generate roughly $30 million of sales in the second half of 2023. In addition, we're pleased that just in the last few days, we closed on the acquisition of EBY Electro. EBY is based in the state of New York and the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $15 million. And EBY is a designer and distributor of terminal block interconnect products to the North American industrial market. The addition of EBY further expands our offering of high-technology interconnect products into the diversified industrial market.\nAs we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new organizations into the Amphenol organization remains a core competitive advantage for us.\nNow turning to the trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad, in particular, in hits these very dynamic times, Amphenol's end market diversification continues to create great value for the company. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew by a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these robust second quarter levels.\nI just have to say that we remain very encouraged by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We continue to make targeted investments to expand our capacity and look forward to supporting this increased demand with our broad product offering.\nTurning to the Commercial Aerospace market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and we had another very strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 40% in U.S. dollar and organically from prior year, as we benefited from both the continued recovery in global aircraft production as well as our ongoing efforts to expand our position within this market. Sequentially, our sales grew 9% from the first quarter, which was much better than expectations coming into Q2.\nWe're also very pleased that in the second quarter, our Commercial Air business was able to reach its highest ever level of quarterly sales. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these strong second quarter levels. And I'm just truly grateful to our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives in 2023 and beyond.\nThe industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market were flat in U.S. dollars and local currencies, but did decline by 7% organically, as growth in medical, transportation, oil and gas, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments was more than offset by moderations across the other segments of the industrial market together with lower sales to the distribution channel.\nOn a sequential basis, sales declined 3% from the first quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations. This reflected some incremental slowing of demand from certain customers, in particular, in factory automation and heavy equipment. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these second quarter levels. Nevertheless, and despite this positive demand, I'm very proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.\nThe automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, and this was slightly better than our expectations coming into Q2. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the second quarter. And I'm just really proud of our team working in automotive. And their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications.\nThe mobile device market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales did moderate by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically in the second quarter, as strength in smartphones and related products was more than offset by declines in tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-teens decline that we had coming into the quarter. As we now look into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase sequentially in the mid-teens from these second quarter levels on seasonal strength. While there's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets, our team once again in the second quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the second half of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond.\nThe mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 24% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as we manage through the expected and broad-based weakness in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter declined by 6%, which was -- better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect sales to remain at roughly similar levels as we achieved here in the second quarter.\nLook, there's no doubt that it's a challenging short-term wireless investment environment. But nevertheless, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks With now the addition of RFS together with our already broad array of products, when customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.\nThe IT datacom market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. And while sales did decline by 24% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually better than we had expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, sales increased by 6%, which was in excess of our expectations for sales to be flat. This sequential uptick in sales was driven by a surge in demand from customers accelerating their investments in AI-focused systems or alternative intelligence -- artificial intelligence, which offset somewhat weaker demand in more traditional markets. We also saw robust orders for AI-related applications, which is a strong affirmation of our team's success in positioning Amphenol as a true leader in the interconnect systems that support AI. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels.\nWhile we are continuing to manage through the inventory adjustment in the broader IT market, we are more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this important space. Whether enabling the current surge in AI-related installations, or the broader range of Internet-enabling networks, our team has done an outstanding job developing leading high-speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for Amphenol.\nThe broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were flat from prior year and up just 1% organically as broadband operators tempered their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 2%, which was modestly better than our expectations. Now looking into the third quarter, we do expect a mid-single-digit sequential decline in sales as operators moderate their spending following several quarters of strong demand and investments. Regardless of this momentary pause in demand, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, there remains a significant amount of government-funded initiatives, particularly in North America, which gives us confidence for the future of the broadband market.\nNow turning to our outlook and assuming the current market environment does not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $3.040 billion to [ $3.1 ] billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. This would represent a sales decline of 6% to 8% and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 8% to 10% compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nI remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our composition while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.\nFinally, and really most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter.\nAnd operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn -- introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig Lampo\n\nSVP & CFO, Amphenol Corporation\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.\nWe would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Our first quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.\nThe company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.974 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.71 and $0.69, respectively. First quarter sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars [ inorganically ] and up 3% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nSequentially, sales were down by 8% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 10% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were $2.896 billion, which was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97:1. The lower book-to-bill was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets, which continue to experience a decline in demand.\nGAAP and adjusted operating income were $592 million and $597 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 19.9% and 20.1%, respectively, in the first quarter.\nOn a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of '22 and decreased by 70 basis points sequentially, and GAAP operating margins for the first quarter included $5 billion of acquisition-related costs.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating margin increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of '22 and decreased by 80 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the modestly higher sales volumes. And on a sequential basis, the decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels.\nOur team continues to execute strongly in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these strong levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world, including the moderating conditions in several of our communications-related markets. In particular, we truly appreciate the quick reactivity of our teams working in the communications markets, who took appropriate actions to preserve strong profitability in the face of downturns in customer demand.\nBreaking down first quarter results by segment. In the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, sales were $854 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically versus prior year. Segment operating margin was 26.5%.\nIn the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.127 billion in the quarter, which was a decrease of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 20.5%.\nIn the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $993 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars [ inorganically ] versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 18%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.9%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.8% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2022, respectively.\nGAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.71 compared to $0.68 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.69 compared to $0.67 in the first quarter of 2022.\nOperating cash flow in the first quarter was $532 million or 125% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $436 million or 102% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver a strong cash flow yield.\nFrom working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 93, 72 and 52 days, respectively. The higher inventory days were primarily driven by the lower sales level in the first quarter, together with some continued impacts from the supply chain disruptions that our industry experienced over the past year. Our management team is focused on bringing the inventory days back down to a more normal range over the coming quarters.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $79. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2023 was more than $290 million.\nTotal debt at March 31 was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, which includes cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nFirst quarter EBITDA was $708 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 1.0x. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nR. Norwitt\n\nWell, Craig, thank you very much, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I hope you all are all enjoying a lovely spring so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then make some comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end.\nWith respect to the first quarter, our results were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew from prior year by 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency, reaching $2.974 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 1%, with growth in commercial air, broadband, military, automotive and industrial markets, largely offset by declines in the IT datacom, mobile networks and mobile devices markets.\nThe company booked just under $2.9 billion in orders in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.97:1. Our operating margins, adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached 20.1%, and that was a 10-basis-point increase from last year's levels.\nAs Craig just mentioned, we achieved a still very robust level of profitability despite the ongoing cost challenges around the world, as well as declining volumes in many of our communications markets, and this is just an excellent reflection of the strength of our company's execution in these very dynamic times.\nAdjusted diluted EPS grew 3% from prior year to $0.69, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $532 million and $436 million, respectively, in the quarter, all clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I'm just extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians around the world. The company's results this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our uniquely entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment.\nNow turning to our progress across our various served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the worldwide electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risk associated with any given market or application.\nSo with that said, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. And this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 2%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the first quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels.\nWe remain very encouraged by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's broadest range of high-technology interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become certainly more dynamic, nations around the world are expanding their investments in next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our wide array of interconnect and sensor products, together with our expanded capacity, resulting from the investments that we've made in recent years.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 44% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. And while aircraft production may not yet be back to the levels that it was before the pandemic, we are very pleased that after several very challenging years in this market, our team has driven our sales essentially back to precrisis levels, a really great achievement.\nSequentially, our sales grew by a much better-than-expected 15% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels.\nI'm just so grateful to our team who works in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft, are paying real dividends. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives here in 2023 and beyond.\nThe industrial market represented 28% of our quarter -- of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market grew from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency and 5% organically. This growth was driven, in particular, by sales into traditional and alternative energy generation, heavy equipment, rail mass transit, factory automation and medical applications, together with contributions from our acquisition program. On a sequential basis, sales were up 2% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as we saw here in the first quarter.\nOur outstanding global team working across the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that are happening around the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.\nThe automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the first quarter grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically, with our growth supported, once again, by strength of our sales into electrified vehicle applications, together with other products sold into a wide array of new electronic systems in cars. While sales in Asia were slightly down from prior year, we realized strong growth in North America and Europe in the automotive market.\nSequentially, our sales declined by 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, and that just reflected strong execution by our team in reacting to opportunities with customer demand.\nFor the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential increase in sales from these levels. And I just have to say that I remain truly impressed by our team working in the automotive market. They continue to grow our global position by remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles.\nIn particular, our long-term efforts at expanding our now comprehensive range of next-generation interconnect products that are incorporated into electrified vehicles, has enabled us to expand our position with a wide range of customers, all of whom are pursuing carbon-neutral driving solutions, and that creates further potential for the business.\nThe mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales declined by 15% from prior year as growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales into laptop, tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined by a slightly better-than-expected 31% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further mid-teen sales decline from these first quarter levels. There's no question that the mobile devices market remains one of our most volatile, nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team has adjusted their resources in real time with the changing levels of demand and stands poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond.\nOur leading array of antennas, interconnect products and precision mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term.\nThe mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically as operators and equipment manufacturers reduced their demand after several quarters of stronger consumption. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were down by 11% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the quarter. And now as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further low double-digit sequential decline in sales as operators further moderate their spending.\nOur team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment as well as the networks being constructed around the world. And while there is currently seemingly a pause in the investment cycle, when customers, once again, drive renewed construction of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 17% of sales in the quarter, and sales did decline by 21% in U.S. dollars [ inorganically ] as both service providers and equipment manufacturers moderated their demand in light of still significant levels of inventory across the market. On a sequential basis, sales declined 17% from the fourth quarter, which was a touch better than our expectation of 20% down coming into the quarter. And as we look towards the second quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels.\nRegardless of this current correction in demand largely due to inventory, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has just done an outstanding job developing leading, high-speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance.\nWith exciting new applications, including in particular alternative intelligence, or AI, together with the continued growth in overall data traffic, we're confident that we'll be able to realize the benefits of our leading position in this important market for many years to come.\nAnd finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 17% from prior year and 18% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. This growth was driven by increased network build-outs as well as our customers preparing for new, government-supported spending on expanded broadband coverage, particularly here in North America.\nOn a sequential basis, sales declined by 15%, slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we anticipate a mid-single-digit sequential moderation of sales from these first quarter levels as broadband operators temper their procurement levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's strong and expanded position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.\nNow turning to our outlook. The current economic environment remains, for sure, dynamic and highly uncertain. In addition, we do expect reduced demand to continue in the second quarter across the communications related markets. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. This would represent a year-over-year sales decline of 6% to 8%, and adjusted diluted EPS decline of 9% to 12%, again, compared to the second quarter of prior year.\nNevertheless, I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.\nFinally, I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to offer my true gratitude to our entire global team around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the first quarter.\nAnd operator, with that, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Amphenol Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a happy new year, and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2022 conference call.\nOur fourth quarter and full year 2022 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this call is on a continuing operations basis.\nThe company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3,239 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82 and $0.78, respectively. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars, 11% in local currencies and 8% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were down by 2% in U.S. dollars, 1% in local currencies and 2% organically.\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year 2022, sales were a record $12.623 billion, which were up 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currencies and 15% organically compared to 2021.\nOrders in the quarter were $2.884 billion, which was down 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 8% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89:1. This was driven by lower bookings in the communications-related markets. For the full year, orders were $12.925 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1.\nGAAP and adjusted operating income were $666 million and $676 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.6% and 20.9%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '21 and decreased by 10 basis points sequentially.\nGAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '21 and decreased by 10 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions.\nOn a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. For the full year 2022, GAAP operating margin was 20.5% and adjusted operating margin was 20.7%. When compared to 2021, adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, which was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of the pricing actions.\nGiven the overall cost and supply chain headwinds we experienced in 2022, we are very proud that our adjusted operating margin equals our previous full year record operating margin set in 2018.\nBreaking down fourth quarter and full year results by segment. In the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, sales were $795 million and $3.107 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, respectively. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. Compared to the full year 2021, segment sales increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Segment operating margin was 25.7% and 25.8% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, respectively.\nIn the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.436 billion and $5.652 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars and organically. Compared to the full year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.2% and 22% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022.\nIn the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $1.008 billion and $3.863 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Compared to the full year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. Segment operating margin was 19.2% and 18.5% in the fourth quarter and full year 2022.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.2% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 18.8% and 23.8% and in the fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. For the full year 2022, GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% and adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 20.6% and 24.3% in 2021. In 2023, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nGAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.82 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14% compared to $0.72 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, an increase of 11% compared to the $0.70 in the fourth quarter of '21. This was an excellent result. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $3.06, a 22% increase from $2.51 in 2021. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3 in 2022, a 21% increase from $2.48 in 2021.\nOperating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $705 million or 147% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $613 million or 127% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have delivered a cash flow yield at these strong levels.\nFor the full year 2022, operating cash flow was a record $2.175 billion or 117% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2022 was a record $1.796 billion or 96% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 86, 73 and 54 days, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $75, bringing total repurchases during 2022 to 9.9 million shares or $731 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2022 was more than $1.2 billion.\nTotal debt on December 31 was $4.6 billion and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very strong $4.1 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.4 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nFourth quarter and full year 2022 EBITDA was $798 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, our net leverage ratio was 1.0x. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense.\nAs I had mentioned last quarter, due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense has increased primarily as a result of our floating rate commercial paper, which represents approximately 14% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the year. And based on current and near-term expected interest rates and debt levels, we expect 2023 quarterly interest expense to be approximately $40 million, which is reflected in our first quarter guidance.\nI will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends as well as the recently completed acquisition this month.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Amphenol Corporation\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and welcome to all of you to our first earnings call of 2023. And I hope it's not too late to wish as well all of you a happy new year. And to those of you who celebrate the Lunar New Year, I wish you all a happy year of the rabbit.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our fourth quarter and full year 2022 achievements, including some discussion about the acquisitions that we mentioned in our press release. I'll then discuss our trends and progress in our served markets and then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time for questions at the end.\nSo turning to the fourth quarter. Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $3.239 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 8%, and that was driven by robust growth in the broadband, commercial air, automotive and military end markets. And I'll give some more details about those markets in a few moments.\nThe company booked $2.884 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.89:1. And this negative book-to-bill was driven by order reductions in several of the communications related markets as certain customers adjusted demand in light of excess inventory that they had built up throughout 2022.\nWe're especially pleased to have delivered another quarter of resilient and strong profitability, with adjusted operating margins reaching 20.9%, an 80 basis point increase from prior year. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of challenges around the world.\nAdjusted diluted EPS, as Craig mentioned, was $0.78, representing robust growth of 11% from prior year, and that's just another excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution. Finally, the company generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $705 million and $613 million, respectively, clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings.\nI'm extremely proud of our team around the world and our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a challenging and dynamic environment.\nWe're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Control Measure Regulation Group, or CMR, just here in January. CMR is based in France and has annual sales of approximately $75 million. And they're a manufacturer of a broad array of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on heavy equipment engine applications. This acquisition further expands our offering of high-technology, value-added interconnect products in the diversified industrial market.\nIn addition, we're pleased to have signed an agreement for the acquisition of the North American hybrid and fiber optic cable and cable assembly as well as the global infrastructure antenna business of RFS at the end of the fourth quarter. Based just down the street from us here in Meriden, Connecticut, RFS is a provider of interconnect and antenna products for the mobile networks market with expected sales of approximately $100 million in 2023.\nThis acquisition, which we anticipate will close by the end of the second quarter and thus is not included in our guidance, expands Amphenol's product offering and presence with mobile network service providers who are continuing to invest in their next-generation 5G networks.\nAs we welcome the outstanding CMR team to Amphenol and look ahead to welcome the RFS team, once that transaction closes, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nI just want to make a few comments about 2022. And I would just say that 2022 was another very successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currencies and 15% organically, reaching a new sales record of $12.623 billion.\nIn fact, over the past 3 very dynamic years, we're proud to have grown our sales by more than 50% from our 2019 levels, actually 53% to be exact, a great reflection of the company's diversification and agility in these truly dynamic times. Our full year 2022 adjusted operating margins reached 20.7%, and that was an increase of 70 basis points from 2021. This strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted EPS of $3.\nFinally, we generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.175 billion and $1.796 billion, respectively, clear confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program again created value this year with 2 new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2022 and 1 added here already in 2023.\nCMR, NPI and ICA Holdings have expanded our position across a broad array of technologies, particularly in the industrial market, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family. We're excited that these acquisitions as well as the RFS acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the second quarter, represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance.\nWe also bought back in 2022 almost 10 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, representing, as Craig detailed, a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1.2 billion for the year.\nFinally, and really importantly, especially in this -- today's dynamic environment, we come out of 2022 in a uniquely robust financial position with the lowest leverage and highest liquidity and availability we have seen really in modern times.\nAnd while there continues to be a high level of volatility in the overall market environment in 2022, as we enter 2023, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance.\nI'd like to spend a little bit of time to talk about our trends and progress across our served markets. And I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create real value for the company, with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in the year of 2022. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.\nTurning first to the military market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 9% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. And on an organic basis, sales increased by 12%, with broad-based growth across virtually all applications, but particularly military vehicles, space and airframes.\nSequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 11%. For the full year 2022, sales grew by 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currencies and 4% organically, reflecting our operational execution as well as strength in space-related, unmanned aerial vehicles, ground vehicles and avionics applications.\nLooking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to grow slightly from these fourth quarter levels, and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we offer the industry's broadest array of high-technology interconnect products.\nAs the geopolitical environment has become more dynamic, militaries around the world are expanding their investments in next-generation technologies, thereby increasing the demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our expanded range of interconnect and sensor products as well as our significant investments in new capacity that we have made in recent years.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2022. And in the quarter, our sales grew by very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currency and organic as we benefited from the continued recovery in the commercial air market.\nSequentially, our sales grew by 13% from the third quarter, which was well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2022, sales increased by 36% in U.S. dollars, 40% in local currency and 36% organically, reflecting our strong design-in positions on a broad range of platforms as well as the ongoing recovery in demand for aircraft. Looking into the first quarter of '23, we expect now a modest sequential moderation in sales.\nI just want to say how grateful I am to our team that's working in the commercial air market. Over the last 3 years, they've performed really well amidst the truly volatile demand environment. And with the ongoing recovery in travel and thus in demand for jet liners, our team's efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect and sensor products while diversifying our market position, including into next-generation aircraft, are now paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this in 2023 and beyond.\nThe industrial market represented 25% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and sales in the quarter grew by 7% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currency and 7% organically from the prior year fourth quarter. This growth was driven, in particular, by sales into alternative energy, battery and electric heavy vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas and medical applications. On a sequential basis, sales were down by just 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations.\nFor the full year 2022, sales grew by a strong 14% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 13% organically. And we really had broad-based growth across virtually all segments of the global industrial market. And looking into the first quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the fourth quarter. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market.\nI remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. To that end, the addition of CMR further strengthens our position, particularly in the important heavy equipment segment, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.\nThe automotive market represented 21% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. And we had another great quarter in automotive, with sales growing by a strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 31% in local currency and organic. Our growth was broad-based but was once again particularly robust in hybrid and electric vehicle applications.\nOn a sequential basis, our automotive sales increased by 5%, which was above our prior expectations. For the full year 2022, I'm very pleased that our sales increased by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currency and organic, reflecting broad strength across our automotive markets, including, in particular, in next-generation electronics, including electric and hybrid drivetrains.\nLooking into 2023, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation of sales in the first quarter from these high levels, driven especially by a seasonal moderation of sales in Asia. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage through a dynamic overall environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles.\nIn particular, our long-term efforts at expanding our range of next-generation interconnects incorporated into electric and hybrid electric vehicles has enabled Amphenol to expand our position with a broad range of customers and thereby created further potential for the future.\nThe mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year 2022. Our sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency and organically. And this was driven by reduced sales of products incorporated into smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables.\nSequentially, our sales declined as we had expected by 10% as demand was impacted by a pull-forward of demand into the third quarter as we previously discussed 90 days ago. For the full year 2022, sales in this market increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically as growth in smartphones and wearables was somewhat offset by a moderation in tablets coming off the high levels of the pandemic.\nWe are pleased with this performance amidst the market with generally muted demand in 2022. As we look into the first quarter of '23, we anticipate a seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. And while mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term.\nThe mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 5% for the full year 2022. Sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currency and 12% organically as we experienced a pause in demand from operators after a number of quarters of strong growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by a higher-than-expected 17%. For the full year '22, sales grew by 8% from prior year and 3% organically as we saw increased demand for products used in next-generation 5G equipment.\nLooking ahead, we expect a high single-digit sequential reduction in sales in the first quarter as operators continued to moderate their investments. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of their efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.\nAnd as customers continue their investments in these systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're also excited by the pending acquisition of the hybrid and fiber optic cable and antenna assets of RFS, which will further broaden our product offering for this important market.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter declined by 6% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currency and 8% organically from prior year as many customers reduced their demand after 5 consecutive quarters of robust double-digit growth.\nSequentially, our sales declined by 11% as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year 2022, our sales in the IT datacom market grew by a strong 18% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 14% organically as we continued to benefit from our leading technology solutions and design-in positions across a wide array of applications.\nLooking ahead, we expect a roughly 20% sequential decline in sales in the first quarter as our OEM and web service customers continue to moderate their demand levels. Regardless of this current demand pause, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market.\nOur team has done an excellent job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come.\nFinally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 5% of our sales for the full year 2022. Sales increased by a very strong 79% in U.S. dollars, 82% in local currencies and 64% organically, as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products.\nOn a sequential basis, sales grew by a much better-than-expected 19%. For the full year 2022, sales grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, as we benefited from strong demand from broadband service operators who are both upgrading and expanding their data networks as well as from the Halo acquisition completed last year.\nLooking ahead, we expect sales to decline in the low double-digits from these levels due to seasonal adjustments from customers. We remain encouraged by the company's expanding position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses, and in certain cases, in further into government programs to expand broadband.\nNow just in summary, I want to comment on our outlook. The current economic environment remains highly uncertain. And in addition, as we did discuss earlier, we have seen certain customers in the communications markets reduced their demand as they normalize inventory levels. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.840 billion to $2.900 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. This would represent a sales decline of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS of flat to down 3% compared to the first quarter of '22.\nI remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and robust profitability over the long term.\nAnd finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2022. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Amphenol Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2022 conference call. Our third quarter 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year -- during this call is on a continuing operations basis.\nThe company closed the third quarter with record sales of $3.29 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. Third quarter sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up by 5% in U.S. dollars, 7% in local currencies and 6% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were $3.151 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.96:1. Year-to-date, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.07:1, and the company continues to have a robust order backlog. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $681 million and $693 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.7% and 21%, respectively, in the third quarter.\nOn a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and was flat sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the third quarter included $12 million of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions.\nOn a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes.\nGiven the continuing dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team.\nBreaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of '21. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $794 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically and segment operating margins was 26.1%.\nSales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.518 billion, an increase by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.5%.\nSales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $983 million and increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.1%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 22.2% and 24.5% in the third quarter of '21, respectively.\nGAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was a record $0.80 in the third quarter, an increase of 19% compared to $0.67 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.80, an increase of 23% compared to $0.65 in the third quarter of 2021.\nThis was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continues to face during the quarter.\nOperating cash flow in the third quarter was a record $576 million or 116% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $457 million or 92% of adjusted net income. Given our continued strong top line growth, we are pleased to see cash flow yield remain at these strong levels in the third quarter.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 71 and 56 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And despite the continued challenging supply chain environment, our inventory days were 83 days, which came down in the third quarter and were also within our normal range. We are very pleased with our organization's strong management of working capital.\nAs mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.21 from the previous $0.20 per share, effective for payments beginning in January 2023.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $72. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the third quarter of 2022 was $289 million.\nTotal debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, which included a cash, cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.\nThird quarter 2022 EBITDA was $806 million, and at the end of the third quarter of '22, our net leverage ratio is 1.1x.\nI also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense and currency impacts. Due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense has increased primarily as a result of our floating rate commercial paper, which had a balance of $904 million and represented approximately 19% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.\nDue to the significant increase in interest rates over the last several months, we expect fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $38 million, which is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. Based on current debt balances as well as current and near-term projected rate increases, we expect quarterly 2023 interest expense to be approximately $40 million.\nRegarding currency and the significant continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter, we expect currency to have a negative sequential sales impact of approximately 1 percentage point and a year-over-year negative impact of 5 percentage points, assuming current rates.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Amphenol Corporation\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I certainly hope that all of you are having an enjoyable fall. Here we are in beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, with the leaves turning a wonderful autumn hue. I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements. I'll then spend a little time to discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. And of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end.\nTurning to the third quarter. Our results in the third quarter were much stronger than expected and exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 17% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of just under $3.3 billion. On an organic basis, sales increased by 18%, with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program.\nThe company booked orders of $3.151 billion, representing a book-to-bill, as Craig mentioned, of 0.96:1. I would say that despite this slightly negative book-to-bill, the company's order backlog remains very robust.\nWe are pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter, with adjusted operating margins reaching 21.0%, a 70 basis point increase from prior year and a 30 basis point increase from prior quarter. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges around the world.\nAdjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 23% to a new record of $0.80, and just really an excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution here in 2022.\nFinally, the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $576 million and $457 million, respectively, here in the third quarter. I just want to say how proud I am of our entire organization around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial team as we continue to perform well amidst what is no doubt a very dynamic and challenging environment.\nWe're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, or ICA, in September, based in North America and with annual sales of approximately $90 million. ICA manufactures a broad array of cable assemblies for a diversified range of applications, particularly in the industrial market. This acquisition further expands our offering of high-technology value-added interconnect products in the industrial market.\nAs we welcome this outstanding new team to the company, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nNow turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Importantly, and I've mentioned this many times before, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both very important benefits, in particular, in today's dynamic market environment.\nI would also just mention that in the third quarter, each of our 8 end markets grew organically and 7 of them in double digits organically.\nSo starting with the military market. That market represented 9% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market grew 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically, which was a bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in space-related, ground vehicles and avionics applications was offset by moderations of sales of products used in communications, rotorcraft and engine applications. Sequentially, sales declined by just about 1%.\nAs we look into the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential sales increase in the military market. And for the full year 2022, we now expect a low single-digit increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position in the defense electronics market. As militaries around the world increase their adoption of a wide array of next-generation technologies in the face of what is no question an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape, our team managing our leading range of interconnect and sensor products continues to position the company strongly for the future.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew a very strong 36% versus prior year and 42% organically, driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Compared to the second quarter, our sales declined just a slight 1%, which was actually better than our expectation coming into the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline in sales versus the third quarter levels. But for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase a very strong 30% compared to prior year.\nOur team is justifiably proud to have now realized 4 consecutive quarters of strong growth in the commercial air market, a clear sign of their resilience and of the continued recovery in the global air travel industry. Going forward, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems being integrated into those airplanes.\nThe industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Our growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, alternative energy, heavy equipment, medical, oil and gas, and building automation. Sequentially, our sales actually increased by 2% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest sequential sales decline. And for the full year 2022, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales from prior year. Our results in the industrial market this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in this important market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of the exciting industrial electronics market.\nI remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many technology revolutions happening across the industrial market.\nTo that end, the addition of ICA further strengthens our position across a number of exciting segments within this important end market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.\nThe automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the third quarter grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 37% organically, driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications and particularly strong growth once again in sales to electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by approximately 20% compared to last year, driven by our expanded position in next-generation electronics and electrical systems being integrated into cars. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage well through a challenging overall environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts.\nThe mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to customers in this market increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. And this was driven by strong growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones, wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 43%, driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve. As we have seen periodically in the past, we do believe that some small portion of this robust demand in the third quarter may have been pulled forward from the fourth quarter.\nAccordingly, we expect a low double-digit sequential decline in sales from these strong third quarter levels. For the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from our strong 2021. I'm very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market, as they continue to execute strongly in the face of an ever dynamic demand for our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms that are integrated into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And no question that this team remains poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in 2022 or beyond.\nThe mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 19% versus prior year and 15% organically as growth in our sales to mobile service providers was only partially offset by a moderation of sales to equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 9%, which was better than our expectations.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit sequential sales reduction after our very strong third quarter. And for the full year 2022, sales are expected to grow in the high single digits. We're encouraged by our strengthening performance in the mobile networks market, as operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment in networks around the world.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter rose from prior year by 16% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was driven by increased demand for products in servers and networking applications, and that was only partially offset by some declines in storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales did decline by 3%, albeit better than our expectation coming into the quarter. We believe that this begins to reflect some of the expected inventory corrections that we've discussed in the past by our IT datacom customers.\nAs we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit decline in sales from these third quarter levels as customers continue to moderate their demand and adjust their inventory levels. For the full year 2022, however, we expect very strong high-teens sales growth compared to prior year. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done just an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers, who continue to drive their equipment and networks towards ever higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come.\nAnd finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by a very robust 65% in U.S. dollars and 46% organic, as we experienced strong demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 2%, which was better than our expectation coming into the third quarter.\nLooking towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from these strong third quarter levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by more than 50% from prior year, and that includes both robust organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. These products have become even more critical as our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And this is in certain cases, and furtherance of government-funded programs to expand broadband.\nNow turning to our outlook. There is no doubt that the current economic environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly dynamic. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.15 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOur fourth quarter guidance represents also an expectation for full year sales of $12.474 billion to $12.534 billion and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.95 to $2.97. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 15% and 19% to 20%, respectively.\nI remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow our market position while driving strong profitability. In addition, I just have to say that the entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would be remiss, if I did not take this opportunity here to thank each and every one of our Amphenolian team members around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Amphenol Corporation\n\nThanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Our second quarter 2022 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call is on a continuing operations basis, including prior year comparative information.\nThe company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.137 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.76 and $0.75, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders in the quarter were a record $3.449 billion, which was up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2021, and relatively flat sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1. Both GAAP and adjusted operating income were $649 million in the second quarter of this year, and GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 20.7% in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 280 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021, and 70 basis points sequentially. As a reminder, GAAP operating margin for the prior year quarter included $55 million of acquisition-related costs as a result of the MTS acquisition.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volume as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which we believe have offset a meaningful amount of the inflation-related cost increases.\nOn a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected operating leverage on the higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of operational and supply chain challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team.\nBreaking down second quarter results by segment. Relative to the second quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $790 million and increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.378 billion, an increase by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically. Segment operating margin was 22%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $968 million, an increase by 15% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.3%.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 23 -- was 23.3%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 17.5% and 24.5% in the second quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.76 in the second quarter, an increase of 29% compared to $0.59 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.75, an increase of 23% compared to $0.61 in the second quarter of 2021.\nThis was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter, including certain COVID-related shutdowns in China. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was a record $543 million or 117% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $452 million or 97% of adjusted net income.\nGiven the continued supply chain challenges, we were pleased to see cash flow yield recover back to normal levels in the second quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 72 and 58 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And inventory days were 86, which was slightly elevated due to the challenging supply chain environment that continued in the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $70. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the second quarter of 2022 was $305 million. Total debt at June 30 was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at end of the quarter was $3.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2022 EBITDA was $759 million. And at the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 1.2x.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Amphenol Corporation\n\nWell, Craig, thank you very much, and I hope that all of you on the call here today are enjoying the summer so far, and most importantly, your family, your friends and your colleagues are all still managing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And then I'm going to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And then finally, we'll, of course, have time for questions.\nAs Craig just went over, our results in the second quarter were much better than expected. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $3.137 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, supported by robust growth across nearly all of our end markets as well as contributions from our acquisition program, which was partially offset by the strengthening U.S. dollar.\nCompany booked record orders of nearly $3.450 billion, and that represented a continued positive book-to-bill of 1.1:1. We're especially pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter with operating margins reaching 20.7%, and that's 70 basis point increase from both prior year and prior quarter, and we achieved these operating results despite facing a wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges as well as the COVID shutdowns in China that Craig mentioned. Adjusted diluted EPS grew a strong 23% from prior year to a new record of $0.75, another excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. And then finally, we're very pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $543 million and $452 million respectively.\nI just want to say how proud I am of our team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, who has continued to perform very well amidst a highly dynamic and challenging environment.\nWe're very pleased to have announced in the quarter that we closed on the acquisition of NPI Solutions based in Morgan Hill, California, and with annual sales of approximately $65 million. NPI is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on customers in the semiconductor equipment and test and measurement markets. The addition of NPI expands our already broad position in value-add interconnect for these important and high potential markets. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring those companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nNow turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just note once again how pleased we are that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. No doubt about it, during these very dynamic times, that market diversification continues to create great value for the company.\nThe military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 2% from prior year but were flat organically, with moderations in our sales into naval and military vehicle applications, offset by growth in space, avionics and UAVs. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels, and we continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position across the military market.\nAs militaries around the world continue to adopt a wide array of next-generation defense technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across all major defense programs. This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales increased by a very strong 32% from prior year and 36% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew 11% from the first quarter, which was actually much better than the expectations that we had coming into the quarter.\nLooking into the third quarter, while we do expect a seasonal low double-digit sequential decline in sales, we anticipate continued and substantial growth from prior year. We're very encouraged to have driven another quarter of strength in the commercial air market, which is quite a welcome development after 2 extremely challenging years in the air travel industry. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those planes. I'm particularly proud of our team working in commercial air, who really have persevered throughout the downturn, and we are now once again realizing the fruits of their long-term labors.\nIndustrial market represented 26% of our sales in the second quarter. Sales in the quarter grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most of our industrial end markets, including especially the battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, oil and gas, medical and rail mass transit. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8% from the first quarter.\nLooking into the third quarter, we expect sales to roughly remain at these very robust second quarter levels. I have to say that our results this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market.\nTo that end, the addition of NPI Solutions further strengthens our position in the important semiconductor and test and measurement equipment interconnect markets. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this long-term strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew 23% in U.S. dollars and 29% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, with particular strength once again in sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications.\nSequentially, our sales increased by 6%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter when we had anticipated a modest sequential decline. For the third quarter, we now expect a moderate sequential decline in sales as customers continue to manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the important and dynamic automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts.\nThe mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales increased by 7% in the second quarter as strength in smartphones and laptops were somewhat offset by a moderation of sales of products incorporated into tablets. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 6% versus the first quarter.\nLooking now into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by more than 20% compared to the second quarter levels on typical seasonal strength. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. In particular, amidst the COVID-related disruptions in China that occurred early in the quarter, our outstanding and agile team once again delivered strong results. Most importantly, they continue to design our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And they remain, as always, poised to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond.\nThe mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as strength from products sold to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions, more than offset a moderation of our sales to wireless equipment manufacturers.\nSequentially, our sales in the second quarter grew by a slight 1%, but that was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect to grow moderately from the second quarter levels. We're encouraged by the company's continued strength in our sales into the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected, rising by a very robust 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically from prior year. Our team really just executed well in fulfilling broad-based strength across server and networking applications, including with web service providers. Sequentially, our sales increased by 11% in the second quarter, which was better than our expectations.\nLooking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these very strong second quarter levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Both our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance really in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come.\nFinally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. Our growth in broadband was particularly strong in North America. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 14% from the first quarter. As we head into the third quarter, we do expect sales to the broadband market to decline moderately from these levels. But we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to even more homes and businesses, these products have become even more critical.\nNow turning to the company's outlook. There's no doubt that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as some continued disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming those conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the third quarter, We Expect Sales In The Range Of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent strong sales growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nI just want to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding Amphenol management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains fully committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued well-being of each of our employees around the world. And finally, and most importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank that entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Amphenol Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2022 conference call. Our first quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as previously announced, effective January 1, 2022, we aligned our businesses into 3 new reportable segments. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, we are reporting results for these new segments as well as the relevant comparable historical financial data.\nThe company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.95 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 and $0.67, respectively. First quarter sales were up 24% in U.S. dollars, 25% in local currencies and 17% organically compared to the first quarter of 2021. The significant sales increase was driven by double-digit organic growth in the IT data communications, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were down by just 2% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and down 4% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOrders for the quarter were a record $3.441 billion, which is up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and up 5% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.17:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $590 million in the first quarter. And operating margin was a strong 20% in the first quarter of 2022, which increased by 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margins declined by only 10 basis points, which is significantly better than we typically see in the first quarter. Year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with the slight margin dilution of acquisitions completed over the past year.\nOn a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected a normal conversion on the lower sales volumes, slightly offset by the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which became effective in the quarter. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the strength of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.68 in the first quarter, an increase of 28% compared to $0.53 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, an increase of 29% compared to the $0.52 in the first quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company continued to face during the quarter.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 23.9% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Bringing down first quarter results into our 3 new segments. Relative to the first quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $728 million and increased 16% in U.S. dollars and organically. Operating margins in the quarter for the segment was 25.2%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $3 billion -- sorry, $1.320 billion and increased 28% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically. Operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 21.4%.\nSales in the Interconnect & Sensor Systems segment were $904 million and increased 25% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. And operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 17.7%. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $351 million or 83% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $274 million or 65% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would normally expect, even in a typically weaker first quarter, primarily due to a higher-than-normal increase in inventory levels, driven by the continued challenging supply chain environment.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 74 and 57 days, respectively, both within a normal range. Inventory days were 88, which are slightly elevated due to the normal Q1 seasonality as well as the challenging supply chain reasons just mentioned. Our management teams are focused on reducing these inventory levels, although given the challenging environment, this may take a couple of quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $78. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2022 was more than $320 million.\nTotal debt at March 31 was $4.9 billion, and net debt was $3.6 billion. And total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. First quarter 2022 GAAP EBITDA was $699 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2020, our net leverage ratio is 1.3x. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Amphenol Corporation\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and it's my pleasure also to welcome everybody here for our first quarter earnings call. And first and foremost, I hope that everybody here today, together with your family, friends and colleagues are managing to stay safe and healthy as the world comes to some degree of normalcy. Again, I also wanted to just offer our thoughts to the people of Ukraine, who are obviously going through this very difficult time period with the unfortunate war. While we don't have operations in the Ukraine, we do have many employees of Ukrainian descent, and our hearts are clearly with them together with their families and friends.\nAs Craig mentioned, we wanted to highlight or I'm going to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'm going to comment on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll then have time for questions at the end. As Craig mentioned, we drove results in the first quarter that were substantially beyond our original expectations, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 24% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies, reaching $2.952 billion. And organic sale -- on an organic basis, our sales increased by 17% with growth across nearly all of our end markets, and that was driven particularly by double-digit growth in the IT datacom, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets and I'll talk about each of those in a few moments.\nThe company booked a record $3.441 billion in orders in the first quarter, and this represented another very strong book-to-bill this time 1.17:1. And despite continuing to face substantial inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, our operating margins reached 20.0% in the quarter, which was a 40 basis point increase from last year's levels. We're very encouraged by the strong profitability performance for the company, and we see that as a clear sign that our local management teams are successfully managing through this challenging cost environment.\nDiluted EPS in the quarter grew a robust 29% from prior year to $0.67, again, an excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. The company also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $351 million and $274 million, and that's despite all of the challenges that Craig alluded to. And again, another clear reflection of the high quality of the company's earnings. I'm just very proud of our team this quarter. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment.\nNow turning to our end markets. I would just comment that we continue to be very pleased that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. And in particular, amidst these very dynamic times, this market diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol. Now starting with our military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and were up 1% organically with growth in space and avionics applications somewhat offset by moderations in our sales on to UAVs, naval and military vehicles. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 2%, which was just a hair below our expectations coming into the quarter.\nAnd looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's position in the defense market, a market that has renewed importance given the current geopolitical environment. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next-generation technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major military programs. This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in commercial air increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 28% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production.\nSequentially, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 8% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, while we do expect a sequential moderation of sales compared to these first quarter levels, we anticipate another quarter of year-over-year growth in commercial air. After 2 very challenging years in the air travel industry, we're encouraged by the strengthening of our com aero business. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as the next-generation systems that are integrated into those planes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter, and we drove another quarter of excellent performance in the industrial market. Sales grew 31% in U.S. dollars and 20% organically, and this was driven by robust growth across most of the segments within the industrial market. But we did see particular strength in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, factory automation and oil and gas as well as the benefits of several of the acquisitions that we've done over the last year.\nOn a sequential basis, sales were down just 1% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into this quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase moderately from current levels. So this first quarter confirmed once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.\nThe automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and organically with our growth driven once again by the strength of our sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, sales increased by 5% from the first -- fourth quarter which is actually much better than our expectations of a high single-digit decline. And this just reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential decline in sales as customers manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working across the automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment, all while remaining laser-focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicle platforms.\nOur continued outperformance is a direct result of that team's excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 7% from prior year, with strength in tablets, smartphones, wearables as well as laptops. Sequentially, our sales decline was less than we had expected, declining 27% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we now anticipate a low double-digit sequential sales decline from these levels driven by typical seasonality as well as by some impact from the recent COVID-related shutdowns that have been occurring and continue to occur in China. There's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond.\nOur leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the first quarter and sales in this market grew from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically as strength from products sold directly to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions more than offset a moderation of our sales to equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were flat to the levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter.\nAs we look into the second quarter, we expect a modest decline from these first quarter levels. Nevertheless, we're encouraged to see continued strength in our sales to the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. We look forward, especially to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected in IT datacom, rising by a very robust 41% in U.S. dollars and 35% organically from prior year as our teams capitalized on broad-based strength across server and networking applications. And in particular, we saw continued robust growth of our sales to web service provider and data center operator customers.\nWe were pleased that sales moderated by just 2% sequentially in the first quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into Q1. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single digits from these first quarter levels as customer demand continues to grow in IT datacom. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in this important market. Our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come.\nThe broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market also grew by a very strong 47% from prior year and 12% organically as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 30% from the fourth quarter. And we're pleased, in particular, to start to see some progress in pricing actions across this market. In the second quarter, we expect sales to the broadband market to increase modestly from these levels. And we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks, to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to both homes and businesses, our products have become even more critical.\nNow turning to our outlook for the second quarter. The current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges being in many ways, exacerbated by both the war in Ukraine as well as the continued impact of the pandemic which is causing shutdowns in certain geographies, most notably in China. Assuming conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming, of course, constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. These expectations would represent strong sales growth of 9% to 11% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11% versus the second quarter of last year.\nI just have to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges that are still present in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.\nAnd I'd just like to take this opportunity at the end here to thank all of those employees, more than 90,000 of them around the world, the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\n\nCraig A. Lampo\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Amphenol Corporation\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted.\nThe company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $3,027 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.72 and $0.70, respectively. We are very proud that the fourth quarter represents the first time in Amphenol's history that we achieved quarterly sales in excess of $3 billion.\nFourth quarter sales were up 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 18% organically. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the significant sales increase was primarily driven by the robust growth in the IT, data communications, industrial, mobile networks, commercial air, automotive and broadband markets, including contributions from the company's acquisition program.\nSequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and organically and 8% in local currencies. For the full year 2021, sales were a record $10,876,000, which were up 26% in U.S. dollars, 25% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to 2020.\nOrders for the quarter were $3.278 billion, which is up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1.\nBreaking down fourth quarter sales into our 2 segments. The Interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 25% in U.S. dollars, while the Cable segment was up 22% in U.S. dollars. Breaking down full year sales into our 2 segments. The Interconnect segment was up 27% in U.S. dollars and the Cable segment was up 21% in U.S. dollars.\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $593 million and $608 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021 and GAAP operating margin was 19.6%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the Q4 of 2020 and by 70 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021.\nFourth quarter 2021 GAAP operating income includes $15 million of acquisition-related costs related to the Halo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter. Excluding these costs, the fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin was 20.1%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and by 20 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with a slight margin dilution of acquisitions, and these impacts were partially offset by the normal operating leverage on higher sales levels as well as the lower negative cost impacts from the pandemic.\nOn a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to the continued challenging commodity and supply chain environment, which has not yet been fully offset by pricing and other actions. For the full year 2021, GAAP operating margin was 19.4% and adjusted operating margin was 20%.\nThe 80 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the lower negative cost impacts resulting from the pandemic, and these benefits were partially offset by the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021 as well as the current margin dilutive effect of the acquisitions we made during the year.\nFrom a segment standpoint, operating margin in the Interconnect segment was 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and operating margin in the Cable segment was 2.4%. Our margins in the Cable segment continued to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and significant increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions.\nGiven the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through all of these many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8%, which compared to 21.7% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The slightly lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter reflected the year-to-date true-up of a full year adjusted effective tax rate from the expected 24.5% to a slightly lower 24.3% a result -- as a result of a slightly more favorable mix of income for the full year.\nFor the full year 2021, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.6% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3%, which compared to 20.5% and 24.5% in 2020, respectively. In 2022, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.72 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 26% compared to $0.57 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was also a record $0.70, an increase of 23% compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $2.51, and a 28% increase from $1.96 in 2020. And adjusted diluted EPS was $2.48 in 2021, an increase of 33% compared to 2020. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company faced in 2021.\nOperating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $464 million or 106% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending -- our free cash flow was also a record $379 million or 87% of adjusted net income. For the full year, 2021 operating cash flow was $1.524 billion or 98% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2021 was $1.167 billion or 75% of adjusted net income.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 71, 56 days, respectively all of which were within our normal range, and we are especially pleased that our team's focus on all elements of working capital management, which resulted in a significant reduction of the company's inventory days from the third quarter.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $81 a bringing total repurchases during 2021 to 9.3 million shares or $662 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2021 was more than $1 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.6 billion.\nTotal liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. For the quarter and full year 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $726 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. And at the end of 2021, our net leverage ratio was 1.4x.\nLastly, as noted in the press release, effective January 1, 2022, we have aligned our businesses into 3 new reportable segments. We will report results for these new segments as well as comparable historical financial data starting in the first quarter of 2022.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\n\nRichard Adam Norwitt\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Amphenol Corporation\n\nWell, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And hopefully, it's not too late for me to wish you and your family is all a happy new year. I also want to just express my wishes that everybody here on the call together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are all managing to stay safe and healthy, in particular, amidst the Omicron wave that's occurring in many areas of the country.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our fourth quarter and, in particular, our full year achievements. I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook in the first quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A thereafter.\nWith respect to the fourth quarter, we're truly proud to have finished the year with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above the guidance that we gave just 90 days ago. Sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies reaching a new record of $3.27 billion.\nOn an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, driven in particular by robust growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, industrial and automotive end markets. And I'll talk to each of those markets here in a moment.\nThe company booked a record $3.278 billion in orders in the fourth quarter which represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.08:1. Despite the many operational challenges we and others continue to face, including ongoing cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other pressures, our adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached a very strong 20.1%.\nAdjusted diluted EPS was a new record $0.70 and represented a robust growth of 23% from prior year, an excellent demonstration of our organization's continued strong execution. And as Craig mentioned, we generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $464 million and $379 million, respectively, both of which are clear reflection of the quality of the company's earnings.\nJust at the end of this quarter, I'm extremely proud of our team. As these quarter's results once again reflect the discipline and the agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well amidst a very challenging environment.\nWe're also very pleased that in the quarter, we announced on December 1, the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited for a purchase price of approximately $715 million. Halo is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components for the communications infrastructure markets with expected sales this year of approximately $250 million.\nHalo's product offerings are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic Interconnect solutions and represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol, in particular with customers in our IT datacom, mobile networks and broadband markets. We're especially excited that Halo significantly bolsters our position in active fiber optic Interconnect products, which is a technology with truly high-growth potential as customers around the world are upgrading their networks to support the acceleration of high-speed data traffic.\nHalo is an agile supplier of these important products to a wide variety of customers across these communications infrastructure markets, whose unique technology and service offering enables them to realize strong operating results. I'm just very excited to welcome the highly talented and entrepreneurial Halo team to the Amphenol family and look forward to great things from them in the future.\nWe also announced on December 1, the closing of the sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business to Illinois Tool Works or ITW. We remain extremely pleased with the entirety of the MTS acquisition, which as you all recall, was announced last year in the fourth quarter, meaning 2020.\nWith the disposition of Test & Simulation to ITW, we have now acquired 1 of the leading sensor companies in the industry, further strengthening our broad offering of high-technology sensors. We're very proud of the performance of the MTS sensors team during their first 3 quarters as part of the Amphenol family, and we look forward to them driving outstanding value for many years to come.\nI remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. And in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nNow turning to the full year of 2021. I can just say it was an extremely successful year for Amphenol despite the many operational and cost challenges that we faced. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically reaching a new sales record of $10.876 billion.\nI would just note that, in fact, over the past 2 years, both of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We've grown our sales by more than 32% from our 2019 levels, which is a great confirmation of the value of the company's diversification and the agility of our management team in every environment.\nOur full year 2021 adjusted operating margins reached 20%, which was an increase of 80 basis points from last year from 2020 despite the multiple pressures on margins that we experienced around the world. And this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.48.\nWe generated operating and free cash flow of $1.524 billion and $1.167 billion, respectively, again, excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. We also put that cash to work with our acquisition program that created great value in 2021 with 7 new companies added to the Amphenol family.\nMTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, LCAB, Unlimited Services, CableCOn and Euromicron, have collectively expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family and thereby strengthening our organization. We're excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance.\nIn addition, as Craig noted, in 2021, we bought back over 9.3 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 38% representing a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1 billion for the year. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility in the overall environment in 2021, as we enter 2022, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance.\nNow let me turn to the performance of the company across our served markets. And I would just note that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2021, and that market, industrial being really 1 of our most diversified markets across the segments within industrial.\nWe believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.\nNow turning to the military market. Military represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales grew from prior year by 6% in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter as we benefited from acquisitions.\nOn an organic basis, our sales did moderate by about 4% driven by reduced sales related to airframe applications and ground vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased slightly as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year 2021, sales to the military market grew by 13% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, together with the benefits of the MTS Sensors and Positronic acquisitions completed earlier in the year.\nLooking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase slightly from these fourth quarter levels. and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the military market. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next-generation technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology Interconnect and Sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs, and this gives us confidence for our long-term performance.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and as well for the full year of 2021. Sales in the quarter grew 27% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the beginnings of a recovery in procurement to support growing aircraft production as well as from the contributions from our recent acquisitions. Sequentially we're very pleased that our sales grew a robust 15% from the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter.\nFor the full year, sales declined by 10% and reflecting the significant impact of the ongoing pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into -- looking into the first quarter, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels.\nRegardless of the challenges in the com air market in both 2020 and 2021, our team working in this market remains very committed to leveraging the company's strong Interconnect and Sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.\nAs personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and, in turn, their procurement of our products. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and sales in this market significantly exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter increasing by a very strong 42% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically from prior year.\nWe experienced robust strength in essentially all segments of the industrial market with particular strength in battery and heavy electric vehicle, transportation, rail mass transit, factory automation, heavy equipment as well as oil and gas. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 2%, which was significantly better than our expectation for a sequential moderation as we saw broad-based strength.\nFor the full year 2021, sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 46% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically as we saw again broad-based growth across virtually all market segments of the global industrial market. Looking to the first quarter of 2022, we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these very strong fourth quarter sales levels.\nOur outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology Interconnect Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.\nThe automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year 2021. Sales in automotive were actually much stronger than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically versus prior year, and this was driven particularly by strength of our sales in the hybrid and electric vehicle applications as well as our sales to customers in Asia.\nSequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 10%, well above our prior expectations for a high single-digit decline as we saw strong demand from customers in anticipation of improving production volumes in the first quarter. For the full year 2021, our sales to the automotive market increased by a strong 47% in U.S. dollars and 41% organically, reflecting the continued recovery of the automotive market as well as our expanded position in next-generation electronics integrated into cars, including, in particular, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation in sales from these very lofty levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter.\nI remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has demonstrated an incredible degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from the reduced sales levels in 2020, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that struck the entire automotive industry during the course of this year. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.\nThe mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales to mobile device customers declined from prior year by 5% and in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in products incorporated into smartphones more than offset the growth that we did realize in wearable devices, laptops and tablets.\nSequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 14%, driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2021, sales in the mobile devices market increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically as we benefited from growth in our products used in laptops and wearables, offset in part by a moderation of sales related to smartphones and tablets which, as you will recall, were particularly strong during 2020 with all of the work from home and study from home dynamics that were there early on in the pandemic.\nLooking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain 1 of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond.\nOur leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and for the full year. And we're very pleased that sales in mobile networks increased from prior year by a very strong 36% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. And this was with growth, particularly from our sales to mobile network operators in support of their next-generation 5G network buildouts.\nSequentially, our sales increased by a higher-than-expected 7%. For the full year 2021, our sales to the mobile networks market grew by 12% from prior year and 7% organically. Looking into the first quarter of 2022, we do expect sales to moderate from these very strong levels. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our long-term efforts at expanding our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.\nAs customers continue to ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter in IT Datacom were much stronger than expected, rising by 53% in U.S. dollars and 49% organically from prior year as we benefited from broad-based demand for our industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optics solutions.\nWhile we saw strength really across server, networking and storage applications, we experienced especially robust growth from web service providers and other data center operators in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales grew by 10%, which was significantly higher than our expectations, which had been coming into the quarter or of a slight decline. We do believe our sales growth benefited from some modest pull-in of demand from the first quarter as customers prepared for potential supply chain issues related to Chinese New Year.\nFor the full year 2021, our sales to the IT datacom market grew by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically as we continue to benefit from our strong technology solutions and leading position across a broad array of applications.\nAgain, sales to web service providers were a significant contributor to our full year growth in 2021. Looking ahead, we do expect a high single-digit moderation in the first quarter, reflecting the very robust demand in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we're excited by our strengthened technology position especially with the addition of Halo's active and passive fiber optic interconnect products.\nI remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come.\nAnd finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year Sales increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year as we benefited from increased spending by cable operators as well as the contributions from our recent acquisitions.\nOn a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 10%. For the full year 2021, sales to the broadband market grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase in the low double digits from these levels as we benefit from the addition of Halo's product sales into the broadband market.\nWe remain encouraged by the company's position with broadband customers and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to both homes and businesses.\nNow turning to our outlook. The current market environment, no doubt, remains highly uncertain with significant continuing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as the impact of the ongoing pandemic assuming that conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates.\nFor the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This guidance represents very strong sales growth over prior year of 13% to 16% as well as adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 17% compared to the first quarter of last year.\nFinally, I just want to note, as we described in our press release, effective January 1 of this year, we have aligned our business units into 3 newly formed divisions, Harsh Environment Solutions, Communication Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems. This new alignment will allow us to further scale our business beyond the $10 billion sales level that we crossed last year. Very importantly, this alignment further strengthens our unique and strong Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship, while reinforcing the accountability of our 130 general managers around the world.\nWe look forward to providing more detail -- financial detail about these reportable segments at the time of our April earnings release. I come away from this quarter still so confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.\nIn addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd just like to close by taking this opportunity to once again thank the entire Amphenol team, in particular, I'd like to extend my thanks to all of our factory workers around the world while many of us have been able to work from home on occasion during these last 2 pandemic impacted years, I'm just so inspired by the dedication of our factory workers who never worked a single day at home -- and it was just a phenomenal thing to see.\nAnd the results that we saw in the fourth quarter really are a great credit to their and our entire Amphan organization's dedication.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that you may have."

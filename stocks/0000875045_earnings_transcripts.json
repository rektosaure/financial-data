My name is Cynthia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call and Business Update. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd like to turn the conference over to Tim Power, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Power, you may begin your conference.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cynthia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Biogen's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. During this call, we make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.\nOur earnings release and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Investors section of biogen.com. We've also posted the slides for our webcast. We posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call.\nOn today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher. Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; Alisha Alaimo, our President and Head of North America; and Robin Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll make some opening comments and then move to Q&A session and to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to just one question.\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you, Tim. To have the first slide, please. So I think we've delivered a very strong third quarter. Particularly, I'm very happy to see our growth launch products, delivering year-on-year growth of 67% in the third quarter. The launch products again in this quarter, and if I look at this year-to-date as well, more than have offset the MS decline on a year-to-date basis. [ La Kemvi ] continues to show good, strong, sustained sequential global demand growth with sales globally of $121 million.\nYou may recall that we disclosed in the second quarter that we had increased inventory levels in China. And so we had higher Q2 sales and with some offset now in Q3 but when you look at this on a rolling 12-month basis, we're very happy with the progress we're making on [indiscernible] the approval of the iClick subcutaneous injection for maintenance is now approved in the U.S. and it has rolled out and patients are benefiting from that.\nSky Claris is now available in 34 markets globally. We've got 30% year-over-year revenue growth. That is actually not as high as even the patient growth because we have a number of early access programs in countries making sure that patients benefit from the product while we negotiate with pricing and governments around the world.\nAnd ZURZUVAE, 150% revenue growth year-over-year. This is just an amazing product. One of the most interesting things is I think we are actually changing the perception of postpartum depression. Every day, there are media stories about this terrible condition from others. Jennifer Lawrence is the most recent person to talk about her experience with postpartum depression.\nSo ZURZUVAE is not just a product. I think we are really revolutionizing how people look at this. And that's important, and it's -- but it's also driving a lot of revenue growth for us. If I look at the pipeline, again, very good strong progress. We have litifilimab Phase III studies now are fully enrolled, and both are now expected to read out in the second half of 2026.\nNow I look at this as not just an acceleration. Lupus is an extremely competitive area. There are a lot of studies ongoing. And one of the things when you look commercially at a new product is, can I recruit patients in clinical trials? Because that's kind of a harbinger of how things are going to work commercially. So if we can accelerate, we can accelerate in a competitive environment that tells me that already physicians are seeing something special about litifilimab, and I'm certainly encouraged by that not just from the fact that we're going to get the data earlier.\nBut as I say, I think it's a good sign for the commercial success longer term of the product. We continue to build out our early stage pipeline. As we'll see in a minute, we've got, I think, an extremely robust late-stage pipeline. Now is the time to turn to an earlier stage. We've started a Phase I study for BIIB142. It's an [ IRAK-4 ] degrader for autoimmune disease.\nWe actually expect to put another 3 to 4 molecules into our early-stage pipeline over the coming 18 months. And then we continue to be active on the BD side. We announced the agreement to acquire [ Alceon ] Therapeutics. This is a very strategic acquisition for us. ASOs continue to be a load of administration that is necessary to treat a number of diseases.\nWe ourselves have other products such as [ selinersen, ] B-80, [ zuravenersen. ] And so this is a mode of administration that will be much more convenient for patients and we're seeing other companies obviously also developing ASO. So this is really going to be a breakthrough, we believe, for patients who are taking intrathecal injections.\nAnd then we have just added the [ C5aR1 ] antagonist through our licensing agreement with [indiscernible] of the nice things about immunology drugs is that they tend to offer you an opportunity to create a portfolio in a product. As you follow these immunological pathways, they can lead to a number of different indications. And the beauty of that is, of course, that once you've been able to demonstrate safety, you can then very efficiently go into other indications.\nAnd again, we expect to announce at least another one, if not 2 further research stage deals by the end of the year. So if we can move to the next slide, please. Now these are -- I love this slide. When I look at this and I look at the lines that are extending all the way across the page, I mean, the company our size, 10 Phase III or Phase III-ready programs and that covers 5 Phase III NMEs.\nAnd we've got a lot of conviction around this pipeline. And we've seen a lot of good data in Phase I. And we're getting close to now seeing a lot of the readouts out of that. Now one of the things that you probably don't think about is that these are not just 10 Phase III programs. This is also 10 launches. If I take just [ felzotimab ] as an example, there are 4 indications of that. 2 of those, AMR and MVI are transplant. Two of those are in nephrology. And then, of course, we've got lupus coming along with 3 indications in lupus.\nAnd of course, we're still in rare disease with orvanursin. We have a next generation of SPINRAZA with selinersen, and we're quite excited about what's coming along with BIIB080 in tau. But all of those require now that we start building up commercial teams building insights, thinking about pricing, thinking about value propositions. So a lot of activity going on inside the company.\nAnother thing I'd like to look at in terms of trying to predict whether things are going to be a success or not is, can we attract strong talent. Because people bet their careers when they come to a company. and especially if it's a new product. And I have to say I've been super impressed with the talent that we've been bringing into Biogen.\nAnd that sort of says to me that people are willing to bet their careers on these exciting new products. And I have seen time and time again over my career that, that often translates into commercial success. Market research is important, but I think some of these other indicators are even more important. So we coming the next slide.\nSo what we've been trying to do over the last 3 years. The first is, obviously, let's grow our new product launches. And again, 67% revenue growth says this is a very strong performance. We've got with [indiscernible] Sky Claris, Jersey even [indiscernible] And when I look over the last trailing 12 months, it's almost $1.2 billion in revenue.\nSo -- and obviously, these products all have long runways in terms of market exclusivity and in each of these, these are first in first -- not only first-in-class, but first-ever treatments in these areas. So we're actually doing an awful lot of market creation. For those of you who've got a lot of commercial experience, you know that creating markets is a lot tougher than just going into established markets and taking market share.\nAnd I think that speaks to a lot of the commercial strength of our teams at Biogen. Then let's look at the profitability of our legacy business. And yes, I think we beat on the top line this quarter because of MS. But that's not all by accident. And I think we are beating just about every analog when you're looking at products that have come to the end of their market exclusivity periods.\nI think that speaks to the strong customer care. I think it speaks to the strong loyalty of patients to Biogen's product. We are still the company that treats more patients with MS than any other company out there. And one of the things that we shouldn't forget is it's not all legacy.\nThere's an amazing product out there called VUMERITY that has been growing very strongly this year. It's almost $0.5 billion sales in the first 9 months of this year. And this is a product that has market exclusivity well beyond the end of the decade. And very proud to see particularly our U.S. team investing more into this business and that is responding well.\nAnd it is really the only patent protected product still in the oral segment, which is extremely important part of the MS market. And then we've been very conscious of being efficient. We are going to deliver this $1 billion of gross savings. We were clear right from the get-go that we would be investing some of that as part of the launch in our new products, but also in research and development.\nYou've seen our revenue growing, but our OpEx growth was still flat over this year. Despite a lot of new investments, we have added products to our late-stage development and we are doing all of this recruitment for the commercial preparation of all these launches that are now in Phase II.\nAnd then obviously, if I look at our pipeline, we have cut development costs by almost 25% and research by 40% and I would argue that we have a stronger pipeline than we did before. And that's really a lot of what Priya has done in terms of being very careful about which products we put into development, building conviction behind those. I think as I look at the pipeline, I'd say we've got a very exciting and a high conviction late-stage pipeline.\nOne of the reasons that we're doing these early-stage deals is, I think we now need to build an early-stage pipeline and Vanquis is just one example of that. We continue to generate strong cash flow, and we continue to look at where are the opportunities across the entire spectrum about how we can grow our business. I think we are very disciplined about where we put that cash flow.\nEverything that we want to invest in has to be something that contributes to growth. And so with that, perhaps we can learn a little bit more about our pipeline, and I'll pass it over to Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nThank you, Chris. This year, we've made important progress across the development pipeline and we are positioned to continue to deliver multiple expected milestones over the next 18 months. As Chris noted, we remain focused on execution against our strategic objectives. And there are a few achievements I'd like to highlight from this quarter.\nImportantly, as Chris mentioned, despite competitive recruitment for trials in the space, we have now fully enrolled both TOPAS studies for litifilimab in SLE. This allows us to now pull forward both expected readouts from these studies into next year 2026. Next, we continue to advance to exciting new opportunities. First, with [indiscernible] where the pivotal study design for presymptomatic infants and the broader clinical development plan has been aligned with the FDA.\nWe are also engaging with ex U.S. regulators and expect to initiate the registrational study in early 2026. We also continue to advance [indiscernible] in late MVI, where we expect to initiate a potential registrational trial in coming months. And today, we announced an update on high dose SPINRAZA, where the FDA provided us with a path forward we resubmitted promptly, and now we have a PDUFA in April 2026.\nOver the last few years, we have transformed both our late-stage and early-stage pipeline. We have followed the science and secured proof of concept to advance high scientific connection assets into potentially registrational stages. And as we prosecute the early-stage assets, we continue to follow the science by testing the most important scientific hypothesis.\nWe now expect to deliver several readouts from our pre-POC pipeline next year. We're also focused on broadening the pre-POC pipeline, both with internal research assets that we advanced to IND stage like with 142 [indiscernible] and by also remaining deeply engaged in targeting external innovation, including our announcement last week, as Chris mentioned, to collaborate with Banco Bio on clinical 1 antagonist.\nTurning to our late-stage pipeline. I'm encouraged by the breadth of opportunities to further scientifically advance our assets including our ability to educate on the profile of our innovative medicines with our data. For example, this week at ACR we presented important differentiated data from our positive Phase III DAPI trial, showing a consistent clinically meaningful benefit across outcomes that are relevant for SLE patients and providers such as flare reduction, fatigue, morning stiffness, musculoskeletal pain, LL DAS as well as remission.\nAnd underscoring our comments that we made at our September lupus seminar on the potential importance of [indiscernible] for patients with SLE, including women of childbearing age we presented data demonstrating limited placental transfer in a preclinical setting. Next, I would like to spend a few minutes on the continued LEQEMBI development to deliver optionality for Alzheimer's disease patients.\nAs you can see on the left side of this slide, we have already been successful this year in delivering meaningful differentiated treatment options for LEQEMBI. Today, it is the only anti-amyloid therapy with a maintenance option as well as an at-home subcutaneous maintenance action. And we continue to advance our rolling submission to the FDA for LEQEMBI subcutaneous initiation.\nThe option for maintenance and the availability of subcutaneous delivery are also potentially relevant to Legend in the presymptomatic AD population. The AHEAD 3-45 study, as you can see here, is an important study that aims to comprehensively evaluate Legend in 2 different stages of presymptomatic AD with the appropriate scientific questions and the relevant primary endpoints.\nAdditionally, we have seen increasing momentum in the development, approval and utilization of blood-based biomarkers. We see this as a key enabler that potentially simplifies the diagnostic pathways. We remain excited and believe the potential for LEQEMBI in the presymptomatic AD population can be an important opportunity for Biogen. In closing, I'm encouraged that LEQEMBI ahead 345 is just one of several important registrational readouts we have over the next few years.\nAs you can see on this slide, our high scientific conviction pipeline will play a critical role given the increasing momentum in our registrational data flow. This will begin with 2 litifilimab Phase III readouts in SLE next year, and 2027 onwards, we will see multiple registrational readouts across several assets in diverse and important therapeutic areas.\nWith that, I would now like to hand the call over to Alisha for an update on our commercial business.\n\nAlisha A. Alaimo\n\nPresident of Biogen U.S. Organization, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Priya and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the commercial results we achieved in Q3, beginning with our multiple sclerosis portfolio. Our MS business continues to deliver significant revenue, which provides the resources to invest in our growth products, advance our pipeline and achieve our vision for the new Biogen. In the U.S., we saw strong performance, mainly driven by strategic actions to support VUMERITY's growth and some onetime events.\nWhen we look at competitive dynamics globally, we are seeing increased impact of TECFIDERA generics in Europe. And for Tysabri, we believe we are well prepared for our biosimilar entrant in the U.S. Now turning to LEQEMBI, which delivered another strong quarter with global revenues growing 82% compared with Q3 2024, underscoring its increasing impact on the Alzheimer's community worldwide.\nIn the U.S., our team is working collaboratively with Eisai driving strong execution and customer engagement, which we believe supported our prescriber base growing another 14% quarter-over-quarter. This quarter, we sustained consistent growth of new writers and new patients and LEQEMBI holds majority share as the #1 prescribed anti-amyloid treatment. Throughout 2025, we estimate LEQEMBI captured roughly half of all the new patients treated with anti-amyloid therapies.\nNow with the launch of iClick subcutaneous auto-injector for maintenance LEQEMBI is the first and only anti-amyloid treatment to offer an at-home injection, giving physicians, patients and care partners more options to continue to slow disease progression following the 18-month initial treatment period. Early feedback from customers and payers has been positive. And into next year, we will remain focused on securing Part D coverage and supporting patient access to LEQEMBI.\nLast quarter, we noted that for the first time we observed early signals indicating the anti-amyloid market grew with 2 players. We are encouraged that this quarter, our data shows the market continued to grow by approximately 15%. We also shared that blood-based biomarker testing was advancing at a significant pace. And here, our physicians have pointed to a meaningful impact.\nThey report blood tests to help move from probable to definitive diagnosis more quickly, enabling HCPs, patients and their families to focus more on the treatment discussion. We anticipate up to 350,000 Alzheimer's blood tests this year and more than 60,000 PET scans to date, which is a 75% increase compared to this time last year.\nOur data show early indicators that PET, CSF positive tests are increasing, which we believe may be attributable to increasing use of Alzheimer's blood diagnostics as a triaging tool. As we previously noted, we are educating HCPs about the quality of blood-based biomarkers, including the performance of BBM and that meet the requirements of the Alzheimer's Association's new practice guidelines for amyloid triage and confirmation.\nAs we look to 2026, we expect LEQEMBI's momentum will continue to be driven by our focused strategies, which we believe are already having a positive impact on intent to prescribe perceptions of efficacy and safety and health care providers' understanding of the role of anti-amyloid therapies. Moving on to Sky Claris, where the launch continues to drive patient growth across all regions, including the U.S. and overseas.\nSky Claris is now available in 34 countries, contributing to strong growth of 30% and compared to the same time last year. In the U.S., as expected, patients continue to grow quarter-over-quarter with quarter 3 revenue being impacted by channel mix in the context of the IRA changes to Medicare. As we shared in the past, our strategy in the U.S. is to reach the remaining [ Friedreich ] ataxia patients, their neurologists and PCPs, which our data indicate are primarily based in the community.\nOur efforts are focused on delivering on the school as nearly 2/3 of new patients in Q3 were prescribed by first-time writers and roughly 1/4 of new scripts were written by PCPs. Outside the U.S., we remain focused on continued geographic expansion with multiple commercial launches planned in the first half of 2026.\nLast, turning to ZURZUVAE, which continues to perform above our expectations. As we shared earlier this year, our expanded field team has had a meaningful impact, delivering $55 million in the U.S., which is a 19% revenue growth compared to last quarter. We are also encouraged by the increasing breadth of writers, which grew 19% quarter-over-quarter.\nAnd in quarter 3, of ZURZUVAE prescriptions were written as first line, demonstrating health care providers' belief in the value of therapy that provides rapid relief to mothers impacted by postponing depression. Across our portfolio, I am proud of our teams for executing with discipline and delivering on our strategic priorities.\nTheir hard work is helping us serve patient communities, build new markets and drive sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Robin for an update on our financial results.\n\nRobin C. Kramer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Alisha. I would like to provide some key highlights about our strong third quarter financial results. Unless otherwise noted, each of the comparisons I make during my remarks are versus the third quarter of 2024. We delivered 3% revenue growth this quarter, driven by continued strong commercial execution. Our 4 launch products generated $257 million in revenue in the quarter, representing a 67% growth.\nWe continue to see resilient performance from our U.S. MS business which was favorably impacted by gross to net adjustments, timing of shipments and strong demand growth for VUMERITY. This was partially offset by continued generic erosion of TECFIDERA in Europe. Notably, the year-to-date cumulative revenue from our launch products has more than offset the year-to-date decline in our MS product revenue.\nThis commercial execution, combined with our disciplined operating expense management resulted in non-GAAP diluted EPS growth of 18% for the quarter. We also delivered $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Turning to our guidance. I'm encouraged by the strong business trends that we continue to observe in Q3. This is reflected in our improved revenue outlook. You'll note that our non-GAAP EPS outlook has been updated to reflect that stronger business outlook while adjusting for expected business development activities that are expected to close in the fourth quarter.\nI will provide more details on this in a moment. Let me cover some key components of our Q3 revenue performance. Starting with our MS franchise. In addition to the strong commercial execution that Alisha discussed, the Merit benefited from approximately $22 million of favorable inventory dynamics.\nAnd overall, USS benefited from favorable gross to net adjustments of $38 million in the quarter. Outside of the U.S., sales were primarily impacted by expected generic pressures for TECFIDERA. We continue to defend our IP. However, we observed an acceleration of erosion, particularly in Europe as generics continue to launch in new geographies, including Germany.\nThis, combined with the channel dynamics, resulted in a sequential net decrease in TECFIDERA revenue of $28 million versus the prior quarter in Europe. On a positive note, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter impact of the Tysabri IV biosimilar in Europe was roughly offset by growing demand for our subcutaneous formulation, which has no biosimilar alternative and now accounts for more than 50% of all branded and biosimilar natalizumab patients in Europe.\nFor SPINRAZA, we continue to be encouraged by the consistency and demand globally. And as expected, ex U.S. SPINRAZA was impacted by the drawdown of the inventory build from the first quarter. We continue to expect full year global SPINRAZA revenue to be relatively similar in 2025 as compared to 2024. Turning to our launch products, starting with LEQEMBI.\nWe continue to see steady sequential demand growth globally with third quarter end market sales booked by [indiscernible] of approximately $121 million. As you will recall, we had a $35 million inventory build in China in the prior quarter, representing roughly 6 months in demand in the region. Approximately half of this build was drawn down in Q3.\nTherefore, as expected, there were negligible sales recognized for China in Q3 as demand was satisfied with the inventory in the channel. We continue to expect demand in China in Q4 to be satisfied with this remaining inventory with minimal revenue generated in the fourth quarter.\nZyclara saw continued growth globally with revenue increasing 30% from this time last year. In the U.S., continued sequential patient growth was offset by approximately adjustment related to channel mix in the context of the IRA redesign related to Medicare. We expect Sky Claris to continue to grow, and we are working to secure reimbursement in certain European markets as well as in Latin America.\nAs Alisha noted, we are pleased to see continued strong growth for ZURZUVAE driven by increased demand. Now a few comments on the rest of the P&L. Before I get into the quarterly dynamics, I would like to highlight the variance shown here between GAAP and non-GAAP cost of sales. GAAP cost of sales was $674 million, up 6% year-over-year due to an approximately $100 million pretax charge accrued in Q3 that related to a judgment on Genentech's claim for past royalties and interest related to TYSABRI.\nWithout this impact, it would have been approximately $570 million, representing an 11% decrease year-over-year. More broadly, cost of sales benefited from favorable product mix from lower contract manufacturing revenue in Q3 2025, which has a lower margin. This trend is expected to continue through the remainder of the year due to the planned campaign timing of contract manufacturing that we have previously discussed.\nNon-GAAP core operating expense or R&D plus SG&A expense is flat year-over-year. What's evident in our results is that we remain disciplined in our cost management as we continued to deliver on our R&D prioritization and Fit for Growth initiatives, while ensuring that we are supporting investments in our launch products and long-term growth potential.\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on our balance sheet. This quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of free cash flow due to business performance and continued cost management discipline. We exited the quarter with $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $2.3 billion of net debt.\nOur financial strength gives us the flexibility to reinvest in strategic growth initiatives, including advancing our pipeline, supporting product launches and exploring growth opportunities as we work to deliver the new Biogen. Turning now to guidance. We have updated our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect a stronger underlying business outlook and investment for growth from business development transactions expected to close in the fourth quarter.\nAs you know, the SEC requires inclusion of acquired IP R&D charges associated with business development transactions and GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. As since these onetime charges, our business outlook has continued to strengthen in the quarter, yielding a $0.25 per share improvement.\nOur updated full year guidance includes an approximately $1.25 per share impact for business development transactions that we expect to close during the fourth quarter including the license agreement with Sana Bio and the acquisition of [ Alceon ] Therapeutics. The following are some key considerations underlying our financial guidance.\nWe expect sales to be roughly flat to up 1% as compared to last year at constant currency, an improvement from our last guidance update in July. This reflects strong business performance, including the resilient performance of the U.S. MS business year-to-date. We also expect increased competitive pressures on the ex U.S. MS business to accelerate, particularly for TECFIDERA in Europe, where we expect the sequential impact in Q4 to be roughly double the erosion we saw this quarter.\nIn addition, as we discussed into July, we are investing to support exciting new pipeline expansion opportunities, including a new program for felzartamab and MDI and the salanersen Phase III study discussed by Priya earlier in the call. As discussed earlier in the call, we are also beginning to invest in prelaunch activities for our late-stage high conviction pipeline and key initiatives such as direct-to-consumer advertising in support of our launch products.\nWe believe these investments position us to drive future growth while delivering innovative solutions for patients. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses will be approximately $1.1 billion. This reflects the typical seasonality of our Q4 spending, our ongoing investments to drive growth and our focus on cost efficiency.\nIt also reflects the progress we've made in our pipeline with the opportunity to invest in 10 programs, either in Phase III or expected to start Phase III in the coming months. We are encouraged by our progress towards delivering the new Biogen, and we believe it's important to make these investments as we work toward our goal of sustainable growth and long-term value to shareholders.\nImportantly, we believe we remain on track to deliver the $1 billion of gross savings and $800 million of net savings projected under the Fit for Growth initiative by the end of 2025. And as I have mentioned previously, we expect contract manufacturing revenue in Q4 this year to be $10 million to $20 million due to planned timing of contract manufacturing batches versus Biogen innovator product manufacturing.\nPlease be sure to review this slide and our press release for other important guidance assumptions. And with that, I will pass the call back to Tim to open up questions\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Robin. Cindy, could we go to our first question, please?",

My name is Cynthia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call and Business Update. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Power, you may begin your conference.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Cynthia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Biogen's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found on the Investors section of biogen.com.\nWe've also posted the slide store website that we'll use during the call. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; Alisha Alaimo, our President and of North America; and Robin Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll make some opening comments and then move to Q&A and to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to just 1 question. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with the performance in the second quarter. In particular, we've seen the growth from our new product launches offsetting our MS decline. MS has also proven to be a little bit more resilient this quarter. There was some gross to net adjustment. But in I would like to call out the performance of VUMERITY. I think Alisha and her team in the U.S., in particular, have put a lot of emphasis on VUMERITY over the last 2 years, and we've been seeing some nice growth. And this is a product where we still got a lot of market exclusivity into the future.\nAs we look at the growth products, I think we're also seeing continued consistent growth with LEQEMBI. We've got a number of enablers coming along that hopefully will remove someone in the system. Those are things like the blood-based biomarkers. The first one has now been approved, but there are now multiple biomarker tests out there. We have a PDUFA date for our subcutaneous formulation for maintenance coming at the end of August. And I think those are all things that are starting to generate some potential shift in momentum in LEQEMBI, but Alisha will talk about that more. But I'd say, I think we're feeling pretty encouraged by what we're seeing there. Sky Claris, again, now is available in 29 markets.\nWe have probably as many, if not more, patients outside the U.S. as inside the U.S. It's rolling out extremely well. Not all patients are on reimbursed yet. And I think as we progress each country, we've been able to get a lot of patients on early access programs. What we have seen is extremely strong take-up in those programs, and then we work basically country by country to get reimbursement. [indiscernible] has had an extremely nice quarter. And again, I think Alisha will be able to give some more color commentary. But I think that's a bit of a sleeper in our portfolio.\nI think is certainly outperforming our internal expectations. We also had good news in the quarter. We got approval in Europe, and we're looking forward to planning the launch there. As we turn to the pipeline, Priya is going to obviously be able to say more, but we've had some very good news there. All Phase III studies for felzartumab have been initiated. We potentially have another study being started in microvascular inflammation that could add to that portfolio. We saw some really interesting results for salinersen. This is our next-generation product for and we're quite excited about that, and that will be another Phase III that starts this year.\nOn business development, we continue to look across the spectrum of our development pipeline. We're very excited about the research agreement that we concluded in the past quarter with City Therapeutics. And we would expect to see several more of those research collaborations this year. We continue to look at later stage, both M&A and collaborations but again, we remain disciplined in terms of ensuring that anything we do would drive shareholder value. So I think if I look at the quarter, we've got growth top and bottom line. We've had very strong discipline on costs. And so I think the company is performing well.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Priya who can give us a lot more detail about the pipeline.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nThank you, Chris. This quarter, we made significant progress in continuing to build the breadth and depth across the pipeline in key areas. We obtained a positive CHMP opinion for [ zuranolone ] in Europe. Initiated 3 Phase III studies, the pediatric Phase III study for SKYCLARYS as well as [indiscernible] Phase III studies for IGAM and PMM, and we are working with stores towards an imminent FPI for ZuroviNersen. We're also working to further expand felzartumab into a fourth indication called late microvascular inflammation or MVI, in patients who have had a kidney transplant.\nIn support of our continued scientific leadership, we have also presented new data across our key franchises at medical congresses, including Cure SMA, EP&S, ULAR and lupus 2025. And just yesterday at AAIC, new long-term data on LEQEMBI, showing treatment benefits over 4 years with the continued use and bioequivalence data for the initiation dose of subcutaneous lucanumab was presented.\nThis quarter, we also announced exciting new interim Phase Ib data for salinersen in SMA, as Chris mentioned, demonstrating proof of concept. As the company that led transformation in SMA, we are excited about the potential to continue that journey and potentially address the residual unmet needs for patients. Salinersen leverages the same mechanism of action at SPINRAZA, but was designed to be a more potent molecule. And hence, enable the potential for high efficacy with 1 CRE dosing, a profile, we believe that can further address the needs of the SMA's community.\nThe Phase Ib study included children who had previously been treated with gene therapy, but had not achieved the expected motor milestones based on their age, such as sitting, standing or walking despite the extended period of time since having received the gene therapy. We presented the interim results of this study at the pure SMA meeting last month. and I would like to review the key features of that data with you next. While this is a small data set, several features are compelling. First, sale nursing was evaluated as a once-a-year administration. Second, we are seeing a significant reduction in neurofilament, which as you know, is a marker neurodegeneration.\nAnd third, we observed meaningful improvements in motor function, including achievement of significant motor milestones. And on the right-hand side of this slide, you can see 2 examples of participants who were previously treated with gene therapy several years prior to receiving salanursen. The first row represents a child who received gene therapy at around 1 year of age and could not sit when they enrolled in this trial at approximately 5 years of age. They received salanurson 80 milligrams, 1 dose and by their 90-day visit they were able to sit independently. Naturally, these results need to be confirmed in a registrational trial. But these types of data support the potential of sales to transform the standard of care in SMA, and we're working with urgency as we engage with global regulators and finalize the Phase III study design.\nTurning to the lupus pipeline. Together with UCB, we were excited to present new data from the positive Phase III DAPI study in SLE. We know from patients that fatigue is a very common symptom in lupus. It affects up to 90% of patients and is often described as the most disabling symptoms of the disease. It can present as a profound persistent and debilitating tiredness and has proven to be a difficult-to-treat symptom of lupus.\nWhat's important about this new analysis that we presented at UlAR, is that DAPI demonstrated consistent improvements across multiple domains of fatigue beyond what was achieved with just standard of care alone. This includes the newly developed fatigue PRO, which is a novel fatigue measure in patients with SLE. These results further reinforce the potential for DAPI to address the unmet need and become an important new treatment for SLE. Reflecting on our achievements this quarter, I believe that we're making steady progress towards our goal of transforming the pipeline and delivering the new Biogen. The next 12 to 18 months are marked by multiple key expected scientific milestones and regulatory outcomes, including Legend subcutaneous maintenance and high dose SPINRAZA.\nAnd given the central role of the pipeline for our long-term growth strategy, we plan to build upon last quarter's [ felzartamab ] investor webcast by hosting a second thematic seminar this fall, now focused on our lupus pipeline. With that, I would like to now hand the call over to Alisha for an update on our commercial business. Thank you.\n\nAlisha A. Alaimo\n\nPresident of Biogen U.S. Organization, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the strong commercial execution we delivered in Q2 and how evolving market dynamics have created new opportunities that drove our most recent growth. As many of you may remember, more than 18 months ago, we reallocated capital as part of our Fit-for-Growth initiative to prepare for 4 new launches in the U.S. market. We took a hard look at our investments in MS to determine where they deliver the strongest return. And today, we believe we're seeing the results of those decisions. Before turning to the launch products, let me remind you that our MS business has remained resilient and an important contributor to our cash flow.\nLooking at Q2 performance, in addition to some onetime items benefiting the quarter, I am encouraged by the strength of VUMERITY as it continued to grow. We believe these results demonstrate the value of our team's deep institutional knowledge, strong access and relationships in immunology. Moving on to SKYCLARYS. We are delivering on our commitment to bring the first [ Friedrich ataxia treatment ] to patients around the world. SKYCLARYS is now available in 29 markets globally, including key European countries and Brazil.\nExpanding into new markets is helping us realize the full potential of SKYCLARYS, and we grew revenue 5% globally compared to last quarter. Last year at this time, I shared the deliberate pivot made by our U.S. rare disease team to redirect investments to reach the remaining patients treated in the community as opposed to our initial patients who were primarily at centers of excellence. We learned patients in the community had a different profile. They are generally older, averaging older than 40 years old and often with slower progressing forms of FA. Now keep in mind, community neurologists and primary care providers may only treat 1 or 2 FA patients in their career so they can require more education.\nWe have deployed advanced rare disease capabilities to identify patients in need and help HCPs understand the progressive nature of the disease and the potential urgency to start treatment on SKYCLARYS. I believe this shift in focus was a key factor behind the 13% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the U.S. And in Q2, approximately 70% of new start forms were written by the community neurologists and PCPs. This reinforces our belief in our ability to reach the remaining patient population in need. As we have noted before, while we anticipate continued growth in the U.S. the pace may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to the time it can take to identify and reach potential patients.\nWe remain optimistic about the global opportunity, and we're encouraged that new clinical guidelines from the leading patient advocacy group and KME's across the world are recommending intervention with SKYCLARYS. We believe this is helping to build momentum and prescriber awareness for the only DMT to slow the progression of FA.\nNext, turning to ZURZUVE. We delivered 68% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the U.S., supported by a 29% increase in new prescribers. Earlier this year, we expanded our field team, and in just a few months, their impact is reinforcing our belief in ZURZUVE's potential for sustained growth. Repeat prescribers now account for nearly 70% of scripts which we believe indicates HCP's growing trust and willingness to treat PPD with ZURZUVE. And last quarter, 80% of ZURZUVE prescriptions were written as first-line therapy. Today, most reimbursement policies do not require step edits or complex prior authorizations, helping to accelerate patient access.\nLooking ahead, we are hopeful to bring ZURZUVE to patients outside the United States. And lastly, shifting to LEQEMBI. The U.S. Alzheimer's market is undergoing a significant evolution that began with LEQEMBI's FDA approval just 2 years ago. To accelerate this large-scale change, our efforts at launch were primarily focused on helping health systems establish capabilities to diagnose, treat and safely monitor a high volume of Alzheimer's patients. we believe sites are making progress. For example, we estimate that since the beginning of LEQEMBI's launch, nearly 1/3 of customers have begun diagnosing MCI and mild AD patients for the very first time. On average, Medicare claims data has shown that prescribers have reduced the time from diagnosis to first infusion by 6 weeks since the beginning of last year.\nThis year, we also see significant improvements in the time it takes sites to add patients beyond their first one and in their depth of prescribing. Monthly pet testing has increased approximately fivefold over the last 1.5 years. Blood-based biomarker testing has grown by 50% in the past 6 months from 2 of the major lab companies and has nearly tripled in the past year. We think this is an early promising indication that there is high awareness and willingness to adopt blood-based biomarkers. We will work in partnership with the Alzheimer's community to educate about the quality of these tests and explore the opportunity for widespread use.\nThis maturing of the market infrastructure gave us confidence earlier this year to launch new initiatives with ASI, including sharper messaging, a targeted brand campaign and a more precise focus on physicians with the highest potential to prescribe, and we believe these are driving momentum. In Q2, U.S. revenue grew 20% quarter-over-quarter, and we increased new LEQEMBI prescribers 34% year-to-date. It is particularly encouraging to see [Technical Difficulty] that we believe the anti-amyloid market is now growing approximately 15% in Q2. These dynamics are prompting us to deploy the next phase of initiatives designed to further increase LEQEMBI prescribing.\nToday, awareness about Alzheimer's disease is high. Unfortunately, patient and caregiver awareness of new treatments is low. However, our research shows that when patients ask about LEQEMBI and HCP will prescribe it most of the time. With health systems having advanced their capabilities to treat, we activated our direct-to-consumer campaign across TV and digital platforms to build patient demand and awareness. In our campaign testing, patients and caregivers felt empowered to pursue treatments and earlier intervention if LEQEMBI can help them still be like themselves longer.\nIn parallel, we plan to pilot later this year an expanded field team to understand how to improve PCP referrals in key geographies. We are also preparing for the potential subcutaneous formulations of LEQEMBI which we believe would add convenience and optionality for patients, caregivers and HCPs. Looking ahead, we believe that our disciplined execution, efficient investments and our ability to adapt to evolving market dynamics positions us to sustain this momentum and deliver continued growth.\nI will now turn it over to Robin for an update on our financial results.\n\nRobin C. Kramer\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Alisha. I'd like to provide some key highlights from our strong second quarter financial results. Unless otherwise noted, each of the comparisons I make during my remarks are versus the second quarter of 2024. We delivered 7% revenue growth in the quarter on strong commercial execution, particularly from our 4 launch products, which generated $252 million in revenue in the quarter and our MS business in the U.S. This strong commercial execution, combined with our disciplined operating expense management, resulted in non-GAAP diluted EPS growth of 4% in the quarter, absent the approximately $0.26 impact from the acquired IPR&D upfront and milestone expense in the quarter, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $5.73, up 9%.\nBased on the strength of the business performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year 2025 financial guidance. I will provide details on guidance shortly. First, I will cover our Q2 performance. Starting with our MS franchise. In the U.S., as Alisha noted, we had a strong quarter with revenue of $657 million. This was driven in part by higher VUMERITY demand approximately $32 million of favorable inventory dynamics from [Technical Difficulty] and TYSABRI and an approximately $48 million favorable gross to net change in estimate impact across the franchise with $27 million of this gross to net dynamic favorably impacting VUMERITY.\nOutside the U.S., sales are primarily impacted by expected generic pressures for TECFIDERA and a biosimilar for TYSABRI in Europe. We continue to defend our IP. However, we expect accelerating competitive pressures on the ex-U.S. MS business in the second half of 2025, particularly for TECFIDERA in Europe.\nFor SPINRAZA, we continue to be encouraged by the consistency in demand globally. And as expected, ex U.S. SPINRAZA was impacted by the drawdown of the inventory build from the first quarter, which we expect to continue into Q3. We continue to expect full year global SPINRAZA revenue to be relatively similar in 2025 as compared to 2024. Due to timing of shipments, we expect revenue in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half. Our 4 launch products each saw increases in demand in the second quarter and together delivered $252 million of revenue to Biogen, which was an increase of 26% quarter-over-quarter and 91% year-over-year. Again, this quarter, the year-over-year performance of these products together offset the decline in our MS portfolio. We continued to see steady sequential demand growth for LEQEMBI globally with second quarter global end market sales booked by ASI of approximately $160 million.\nThis includes the favorable impact of the timing of shipments to China of approximately $35 million as the collaboration optimized global inventory positions in Q2. We expect this inventory build to work down in the second half of the year.\nWhat is encouraging is that excluding the China shipment timing impact, global sales grew 29% sequentially and 211% year-over-year. SKYCLARYS saw continued demand growth globally and the U.S. demand growth more than offset the expected Medicare discount dynamics in the quarter. Internationally, SKYCLARYS was negatively impacted by the timing of shipments in certain markets. We expect SKYCLARYS to continue to grow globally, and we are working to secure reimbursement in certain European markets as well as in Brazil. We experienced strong demand growth for ZURZUVE in the quarter. And as Alisha noted, Q2 revenue was $46 million, up 213% year-over-year and 68% quarter-over-quarter.\nAs a reminder, Biogen shares 50% of the profit or loss on ZURZUVE, which is recognized in the collaboration profit sharing line on our P&L. I would like to note we understand that earlier this month, [ IQVIA ] updated their methodology for reporting shipped prescriptions for ZURZUVE and other products as part of their routine data review. This may mean the capture rate may be lower. We are encouraged by the opportunity for ZURZUVE, including the potential in Europe with the recent positive CHMP opinion.\nTurning to contract manufacturing revenue. The increase in revenue was driven by the acceleration of timing for manufacturing batch releases, some of which were associated with LEQEMBI due to our Q4 planned plant maintenance activity. We continue to believe that contract manufacturing revenue will be roughly consistent when comparing full year 2025 with full year 2024 and we expect minimal revenue in Q4 2025 due to the planned maintenance activity. Now a few comments on the rest of the P&L. Non-GAAP cost of sales was impacted by higher lower-margin contract manufacturing revenue in Q2 2025. a continuation of the trend we saw in the first quarter as we accelerated batches ahead of the planned Q4 plant maintenance I just mentioned.\nNon-GAAP core operating expense or R&D plus SG&A expense decreased 2% year-over-year as we continued to deliver on our R&D prioritization and Fit-for-Growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income included approximately $47 million of acquired and process R&D charges. This includes $16 million related to City Therapeutics transaction and a $30 million milestone related to initiation of the second Phase III study for felzartamab. Excluding the impact from acquired IPR&D, non-GAAP operating income would have been approximately $1 billion, up 5% year-over-year.\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on our balance sheet. We generated $134 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. This reflects $745 million in cash tax payments in the quarter our cash tax payments for the year are heavily concentrated in Q2. Also in the second quarter, we used the proceeds of the $1.75 billion of newly issued debt to fully redeem our $1.75 billion of senior notes that were due in September. And while this financial transaction resulted in no net change to our overall debt profile, we expect roughly $15 million to $20 million of incremental interest expense in the second half of 2025, which we have factored into our updated guidance for the year.\nWe ended the second quarter with $2.8 billion of cash and approximately $3.5 billion of net debt and we believe that our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to continue to invest in both internal and external growth opportunities. We believe the structure of our business model positions us to be potentially more resilient to macroeconomic factors and policy uncertainty. Today, a significant portion of our U.S. product revenue is derived from products which are largely manufactured in the United States. And we recently announced a plan to continue to invest in our North Carolina manufacturing operations.\nThis is a combination of capital and operating expense over several years that is intended to modernize and add manufacturing capabilities to fuel the continued advancement of Biogen's late-stage pipeline and support our next wave of potential products. It is also important to note that there are other aspects of our business model that we believe are important to our ability to be resilient in an uncertain environment. We generate a relatively high percentage of our revenue outside of the U.S. We also have a significant Rare Disease business and our payer channel mix in the U.S. is diversified and skewed more towards commercial payers.\nWe believe these are important considerations as we navigate the current environment, and we will continue to monitor the evolving landscape.\nTurning now to guidance, where we have raised our full year 2025 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of between $15.50 and $16 from $14.50 to $15.50. We are raising our guidance to reflect a stronger expected business outlook for the full year, largely reflecting the strong first half revenue performance including the resilient performance of the U.S. business and MS and the performance of our launch products, partially offset by the impact of the City Therapeutics transaction in the second quarter. Please note that the impact from the $30 million [ felzartamab ] milestone I mentioned earlier was already contemplated in our previous guidance. The following are some key considerations underlying the guidance raise. We now expect total revenue for 2025 to be approximately flat compared to full year 2024. This reflects the strong first half revenue performance, including the resilient performance of the U.S. MS business.\nExcluding the $75 million of favorability from inventory and the onetime gross-to-net adjustments in the second quarter, we expect U.S. revenue trends for the second half of 2025 to be roughly in line with the first half. We also expect increased competitive pressures on the ex-U.S. MS business in the second half of 2025, particularly for TECFIDERA in Europe. And as I mentioned previously, we expect minimal contract manufacturing revenue in Q4 this year due to planned plant maintenance activities. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver the $1 billion of gross savings and $800 million of net savings under our Fit-for-Growth initiative.\nIn the second half of 2025, we plan to make additional investments in R&D to enable acceleration and expansion of clinical development activities, primarily in support of rare disease. On this call, we talked about our excitement around moving salanersen to registrational studies and plans for our fourth indication for [ felzartamab ]. As we continue to expand our increasingly exciting pipeline, we believe it's important to make these investments in support of our long-term growth objectives. We now expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for the full year 2025 to be approximately $4 billion.\nPlease be sure to review this slide and our press release for other important guidance assumptions. Finally, we continue to focus on capital deployment that provides long-term value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will pass the call back to Tim to open the call for questions.",

I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody. Maybe first, a warm welcome to Robin. This is your first quarter as CFO of Biogen, Robin. So we had a very good start to the year, a strong quarter. You know, Biogen is really a tale of two companies, in my view. There's one company which has been an MS company, and that portfolio, as you all know, has been gradually declining. But there's a new Biogen emerging. And when I look at the rare disease business and ADs, or ZURZUVAE, and LEQEMBI, and VUMERITY, we actually have a commercial portfolio that we're actively promoting that's now gotten to be about 45% of our product revenue. And those products mostly have a very long runway to continue to grow. And so we've been talking about it for a few years, but I think now this is actually starting to become visible.\nWe're rolling these products out worldwide. We had the approval of LEQEMBI in Europe, for example, which is a very important approval for us. But we've also seen the approval of SKYCLARYS in the UK and Brazil. Of course, the next lever of growth is going to be our pipeline. And there we're very happy to get the FDA Fast Track designation for our ASO targeting BIIB080. That's remarkable since we haven't actually even read out phase II yet, and I think is a sign of confidence in the importance of this potential new medicine in the treatment of Alzheimer's. And of course, we've initiated the phase III TRANSCEND study for felzartamab in AMR. And of course, we've always said we've got a very strong balance sheet, and we're going to continue to patiently and in a disciplined way augment the pipeline through external innovation.\nWe're very happy about the partnership that we built with on zorevunersen and Dravet syndrome with Stoke. That's going to be an important medicine. We have that for the territories outside the United States. Now, if we turn to where we are on these new product launches, so LEQEMBI, I mean, look at that, $96 million. That's almost $100 million. Now we're into serious product territory. We have, as I said, obtained the marketing authorization in the EU. And it's important not just because of the market potential in the EU, but now we can say that this is a drug that has been recognized for its importance, its efficacy, its safety profile by all major regulators in the world. And that's an important sign of confidence. This is, again, the first disease-modifying agent that has ever been approved in Alzheimer's. This is a brand new territory.\nI think having that kind of regulatory endorsement is extremely important. Now, as we all know, this has been a challenging product to launch given the workload that this implies for the treating physician. And we're looking very much forward to a number of the innovations that are coming along that we think can actually reduce that workload. First, of course, is when we have in the bag in Q1, which was the approval for the IV maintenance, which will allow us to reduce the dosing for patients after 18 months of treatment to once per month. Then we're going to make that even easier for physicians with hopefully an approval in August for the subcutaneous formulation. And that offers the potential of at-home administration with an autoinjector.\nOf course, in the first half of next year, we're looking forward to the approval, hopefully again, of the subcutaneous formulation for initiation, which will dramatically reduce the need for infusion bed capacity. In addition, of course, this isn't related to Eisai or Biogen. These are independent companies, but there are companies who are pursuing approval for biomarker tests, blood-based biomarker tests. And hopefully, at some point, we'll be able to see those blood-based biomarkers supplant the need for PET scans and/or lumbar punctures. So there's an awful lot of catalysts coming for the LEQEMBI. But we're very much encouraged now that we've got critical mass behind this. We've also launched a new approach on commercialization from 1 April. We and our partners, Eisai, have spent a lot of time going back through the data, thinking about the lessons learned, and have adapted our commercial approach.\nOne of the things, for instance, that we will be doing this year is now starting direct patient engagement in Alzheimer's. Now, switching to ZURZUVAE, this is a product that continues to do nicely with Q1 sales of $28 million. Since launch, we have now been able to treat 10,000 women with PPD. And the majority of those prescriptions are actually first-line therapy for postpartum depressions. A lesson that we learned along the way was actually the physician who is the most important in treating postpartum depression is actually not the psychiatrist, but the OB-GYN. So 80% of our scripts in Q1, for instance, were from OB-GYNs. One of the most important things here is you're talking about a one-and-done treatment, essentially. And so to make this commercially viable, you actually need to have writers expand. And we did see that.\nSo we were able to expand the number of physicians writing this by 20% in Q1. But more importantly, it's getting physicians to write repeat prescriptions. And one of the most encouraging things is that we're not only seeing the repeat prescriptions, but I think as physicians gain the experience with ZURZUVAE, they're also gaining the confidence to actually go and be more proactive about diagnosing postpartum depression. And so I think we're actually seeing a virtuous cycle here where this positive response by patients is encouraging a greater attention to a disease that, unfortunately, I think has been sadly neglected for so many women. So very good progress on ZURZUVAE. We've completed our own field expansion at Biogen, and that's been in place since the middle of the quarter. Now, if I turn to SKYCLARYS, we had worldwide sales of $124 million.\nThat's up 59% year-over-year and 21% quarter-on-quarter. We did have some effect from the IRA. You all know about the Medicare tax that has been put in place, and that had an effect. Actually, our gross sales in the US rose faster than our net sales in this quarter. One of the things about this disease, of course, is that this is of European origin as a genetic disease. And essentially, where you find the patients is where all the European explorers went in the world. But logically, of course, the biggest number of patients is in Europe. And there we have had an awful lot of success in finding patients. It's actually, I think, easier to find them in Europe because they tend to be in centers, whereas they tend to be all over the country in the US.\nBut even in the US, our US team has been very creative in thinking about new tools to identify where patients are and find them. I can remember years ago with the acquisition of Genzyme, learning the key marketing component of rare disease, and that is finding needles and haystacks. And that's what this is all about, is looking through social media, following family trees, and looking for patients. And so how are we doing on that? If I could see the next slide, you can see that we've got a nice steady growth in patient numbers. We've got about 2,400 patients on therapy globally. It's now available in 26 markets. I would caution that not all of those patients yet are paying patients. We have had an approach of having early access programs in countries to ensure that patients benefit from treatment as soon as possible.\nWe are following up then with negotiations on a country-by-country basis. But the uptake is very satisfying. When you think about the penetration into this market, as we benchmark this, the penetration is actually much higher than the average analog rare disease launch. And actually, in line pretty much with the SPINRAZA launch, I wasn't here for that, but as we've gone back and looked at it, the SPINRAZA launch was actually one of the best, if not the best launch of a rare disease product. So we're very happy with the progress of SKYCLARYS. Brazil approval is actually a very important market for us. There are a lot of patients in Brazil, again, going back to where Europeans went in the world. And having been in Brazil last year and met with a number of physicians, I know that this approval will be very welcome to patients there.\nMoving on to the pipeline, I think we made an awful lot of progress here as well. I mean, you've heard me say, I think, time and time again that I think we had an extremely high-risk pipeline when I came here. First of all, it was highly concentrated in neuroscience. That's always an issue when you only have one therapeutic area. Neuroscience was also a little complicated because we don't always understand the underlying disease biology. The slowly progressing nature of those diseases means that you often couldn't do a phase II study. So you end up doing incredibly expensive proof of concept studies as phase III. Now, neuroscience is who we are, and we've not wanted to abandon that by any means. There's huge unmet need.\nBut we did feel that we needed to add another pillar to our company's future growth. The logical place to go was immunology. We've been in immunology since the founding of our company, particularly through MS. I quote my good friend and former colleague, Elias Zerhouni, who often said, \"We describe too many diseases by their symptoms and not by their cause.\" When you get into immunology, actually, what's important is really the immune pathways. That can lead you into a whole number of different indications. That is something that Biogen actually understands very well. So you can see on the left chart, we've been able to balance this now.\nWe have got a nice balance between neurology, which has been the pride and home of Biogen for many years, but also, I think, immunology, where I think we have a very strong right to play. And then, of course, with that concomitantly, if you look at the right chart, in immunology, one of the things you can do is do a proof of concept. And felzartamab is probably the best example of that. That is an ideal product where we've been able to get a very strong proof of concept. There is never a guarantee in any clinical trial, as all of you know. But I think as we look at the phase III clinical trials for felzartamab, that we feel a whole lot more confident about that than some of the other trials where, again, we haven't had that.\nSo as you look at our pipeline, I think if I could go to the next chart, first thing I would point out, we have five phase III studies that are initiating this year. That's important from a number of points of view. First is, obviously, there is a huge potential that is behind all of those products, and we're getting into late-stage development. So it's a sign of maturation of our pipeline. But the second thing I would point out is we're also increasing the number of shots on goal. We're not dependent on one or two projects. And we're going to continue to build that. I guess the third thing I would point out is we have a number of data readouts that are coming. So as we move into phase III, we'll be able to also have some important readouts already in 2026.\nI think that's a nice cadence that is going to help underpin the continued emergence of that new Biogen. So I think very good progress, and Priya is going to talk more about that. I guess the last topic I would just cover is one that I think is on everybody's mind, which is tariffs. It's a new topic for us all. In 35 years in this industry, I've never had to spend as much time as we as a team have on tariffs in Q1. This is a very complicated area. I know for investors, this is very complicated. I did want to point out a number of features of Biogen, which I think differentiate Biogen from some of our colleague companies in the industry.\nA number of you have been using, for instance, the tax rate as a surrogate for what the tariff exposure might be. I would submit to you that that's actually not appropriate in the case of Biogen. It's for a couple of important reasons. The first is that when you look at our product sales, 75% of our 2024 US product revenue was attributable to products that already have manufacturing operations in the US. In fact, Biogen actually exports more than we import. As a result, also, we also pay an awful lot of tax. Robin will talk about that. We pay taxes in the US at federal and state rates. The other structural difference is that approximately 55% of our 2024 product revenue came from countries outside the US. Now, that's pretty unusual in our business.\nIn most of this industry, what you see is 60% to 80% of product revenues come from the US. Biogen is a whole lot more diversified, and that's really a function of the products that we have. So as we look out for 2025, obviously, there is an exemption for the moment in place. And we know that the whole tariff situation is changing daily, and it's difficult to predict. But at least what we can say is, even if we lost the exemption and all of those tariffs that were announced by the US administration on 22 April were to actually not only come into being, but also apply to pharmaceuticals, this would still not affect our 2025 financial outlook. That's partly because of the long supply chains we have.\nIt's partly because, and I have to credit our supply chain team, they've built levels of inventory, not just of products, but also of different ingredients and materials because, again, this is a highly complex area. But just structurally, we are more of a US-based company and always have been. Actually, we're quite proud of that. So with that, I'm going to pass that on to Priya to pick up the story on R&D.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you, Chris. This quarter, we made significant progress advancing and expanding our high-conviction late-stage pipeline. We believe our pipeline will play a critical role as we work to deliver sustainable long-term growth enabled by increased momentum in our data flow. This includes potential key approvals this year and expected registrational data starting next year. This quarter, we delivered key milestones across Alzheimer's, immunology, and rare disease. First, as Chris mentioned, our tau-targeting ASO, BIIB080, received fast-track designation from the FDA in Alzheimer's disease in April. Alzheimer's is a complex and fatal disease that we believe will require multiple therapeutic approaches to address its diverse pathologies. BIIB080 is a differentiated approach to targeting tau, and the fast-track designation was based on encouraging phase I-B data, which showed dose-dependent CSF tau reductions, decreases in tau-PET signal, and favorable trends on exploratory cognitive and functional measures.\nIn immunology, we initiated the TRANSCEND phase III study of felzartamab in AMR. This is the first of three phase III studies that we expect to initiate this year for felzartamab, with additional studies in IgAN and PMN anticipated by mid-year. Importantly, we expanded our late-stage rare disease pipeline, where we acquired rights to zorevunersen in Dravet syndrome in all territories outside the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by severe recurrent seizures and, importantly, significant cognitive and behavioral impairments. Importantly, more than 90% of patients continue to experience seizures despite treatment with the best available anti-seizure medicines, and there are currently no medications approved that meaningfully address the underlying cognitive and behavioral aspects of the disease.\nZorevunersen is an investigational ASO that is designed to potentially, for the first time, treat the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome by increasing the NaV1.1 protein production in brain cells. What encourages us about this asset is the phase I/II-A data that we've seen, specifically in respect to cognition and behavior as well as seizure. Looking at the right-hand side of this slide, you can see why. Scores on the Vineland III, a widely used standardized assessment of behavioral outcomes, show that zorevunersen resulted in substantial improvements across multiple measures of cognition and behavior. This was initially observed within the phase I/II-A study with continued improvement in the open-label extensions out to two years. We believe these results support the potential for zorevunersen to be the first disease-modifying therapy in Dravet syndrome.\nWe look forward to working with Stoke on advancing the phase III EMPEROR study, which we expect to initiate in the next few months. We continue to remain focused on advancing the standard of care in Alzheimer's, and I believe we've made significant progress. Starting with LEQEMBI, we are really excited about the recent approval in Europe. We're also continuing to advance the subcutaneous formulation for both treatment maintenance and initiation to further aid patient optionality and convenience. Furthermore, we believe that the strength of the LEQEMBI real-world data continues to support the urgency to treat symptomatic early AD patients today. We look forward to the potential of blood-based diagnostics to help remove barriers in the healthcare system. I also believe it is important that we continue to execute on the opportunity in presymptomatic AD.\nClarity AD established that removing plaque in a symptomatic early AD population leads to clinical benefit, and that symptomatic patients with low or no tau can potentially achieve an even greater benefit. We believe AHEAD 3-45 is the right study designed to evaluate the potential benefit of LEQEMBI in a true presymptomatic population. Beyond LEQEMBI, we continue to treat target Alzheimer's disease biology with the potential next wave of therapies, including BIIB080 and novel delivery technologies. Overall, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in Alzheimer's and believe we are well-positioned to lead the evolution of the treatment landscape. Turning to the pre-proof-of-concept pipeline, I'm excited again about the progress we've made in rebuilding this area of the pipeline.\nWe are applying a strong scientific rationale as we invest in these programs, using a disciplined, data-driven decision-making approach as we aim to build out a sustainable pipeline with a promising pre-POC pipeline. During this quarter, we made significant progress in this area, including completing enrollment in the phase II study for our LRRK2 inhibitor for idiopathic Parkinson's disease with Denali. Applying our approach to follow the science, these phase II data, which are expected next year, will help provide us with clarity on the potential path forward to phase III. We will continue to maintain this approach as we work to grow the pipeline by introducing more assets into the early-stage development, both from our organization as well as external innovation sources. With that, I would now like to hand the call over to Robin for a financial update.\n\nRobin Kramer\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Priya. I'm pleased to be participating in my first earnings call since stepping into the CFO role. I'd like to begin by extending my gratitude to those in the investment community with whom I've had the pleasure of speaking with in my first few months as CFO, and I'm looking forward to spending time with many more of you in the near future. To start, I would like to provide a few highlights on our first quarter financial results. Please note the comparisons I'm about to make are versus the first quarter of 2024, unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the first quarter of $2.4 billion was up 6% year-over-year, aided in part by the timing of SPINRAZA and corporate partner revenue shipments.\nOur four launch products delivered approximately $200 million of revenue in the first quarter, an increase of 22% quarter over quarter and more than doubling year-over-year. First quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.02, which was down 18%. This includes the $165 million upfront paid in connection with the Stoke transaction, which impacted EPS by approximately $0.95 in the quarter. Absent that charge, first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $3.97, up 8% year-over-year. In the first quarter, we generated $222 million of free cash flow, which includes the $165 million upfront paid to Stoke. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash. Shortly, I will provide an update on our full-year guidance. Now I'll turn to a few comments on revenue and commercial dynamics in the first quarter.\nStarting with our MS franchise, our global product revenue declined 11% year-over-year, driven primarily by competition. This included impacts from a biosimilar for TYSABRI in Europe and generic competition for Tecfidera globally. We have started to see generics launch in certain countries in Europe, such as France and the Netherlands. While we will continue to vigorously defend our IP, we do expect to see further impacts from Tecfidera generics in Europe this year. A bright spot for MS in Q1 was VUMERITY, where we saw an increase in demand, and VUMERITY remains the number one branded oral therapy. For SPINRAZA, we continue to be encouraged by the consistency in demand globally, which includes growth in the US of 4% year-over-year.\nIn Q1, ex-US SPINRAZA revenue benefited from a one-time VAT refund and the timing of shipments in certain markets, which together was a benefit of approximately $26 million versus Q1 of 2024. As I mentioned earlier, our four launch products together delivered $200 million of revenue to Biogen in the first quarter, an increase of 22% quarter over quarter and more than doubling year-over-year. We continue to see steady sequential growth of LEQEMBI, with first quarter global in-market sales booked by ASI of approximately $96 million, up approximately 11% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2024. Global SKYCLARYS revenue was $124 million, a sequential increase of 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by continued geographic expansion outside the US. Revenue for SKYCLARYS in the US was $69 million, impacted by expected Medicare discount dynamics, partially offset by demand growth.\nBoth ZURZUVAE and QALSODY continue to grow sequentially, driven by increases in demand for each product. The increase in corporate partner revenue in the first quarter was driven by the timing of certain batch commitments related to our contract manufacturing business, some of which was associated with batches of LEQEMBI. We continue to believe that corporate partner revenue will be roughly consistent when comparing full year 2025 with full year 2024. Due to planned maintenance activities and the timing of batch releases, we expect minimal corporate partner revenue in Q4. I'll now turn to a few comments regarding expenses. First quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was impacted by increased lower margin contract manufacturing revenue.\nNon-GAAP core operating expense, or R&D plus SG&A expense, decreased 1% year-over-year as benefits from our R&D prioritization and Fit for Growth initiatives allowed us to absorb incremental spend associated with our advancing and expanding development pipeline, as well as our product launches. Non-GAAP operating income included approximately $201 million of acquired in-process R&D charges, including the $165 million upfront payment made in connection with the Stoke transaction, which had an approximately $0.95 impact to EPS. Excluding the $165 million upfront payment, non-GAAP operating income would have been $748 million, up 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, we and our peers are required to present upfront and milestone charges in GAAP and non-GAAP operating results. Commencing this quarter, we will break out acquired in-process R&D, including upfronts and milestones, in a separate line item in our P&L, consistent with many of our peers.\nWe believe this provides better transparency about our core R&D activities and business development activities. We plan to disclose a schedule of expected charges for each quarter ahead of our earnings calls to aid in modeling. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on our balance sheet. We generated $222 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which takes into account the aforementioned $165 million upfront payment to Stoke. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and approximately $3.7 billion of net debt, and believe that our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to continue to invest in both internal and external growth opportunities. Turning now to guidance, where we're pleased that our expected underlying business outlook for the year has not materially changed.\nWe are updating our full-year EPS guidance to reflect the approximately $0.95 impact from the Stoke transaction, along with $0.20 of an earnings tailwind from foreign exchange impacts from a weaker US dollar. We now expect our full-year 2025 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $14.50 and $15.50. We continue to expect total revenue for 2025 to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage, driven primarily by an increased decline in our MS business. We expect that our launch products will generate sequential revenue growth, but we expect the absolute MS revenue decline to be steeper than this growth in 2025. As a reminder, we expect a potential biosimilar entry for TYSABRI in the US, which we believe could occur sometime in the Q4 of this year.\nAs I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have started to see generics for Tecfidera enter in Europe, and while we will continue to vigorously defend our IP, we do expect to see further impacts from generics in Europe this year. As I noted earlier, we believe that corporate partner revenue will be roughly consistent when comparing full year 2025 with full year 2024. Due to planned maintenance activities and the timing of batch releases, we expect minimal corporate partner revenue in Q4. We believe we are on track to deliver the $1 billion of gross savings and $800 million of net savings under our Fit for Growth initiative. As you can see on the slide, many of our guidance considerations have remained the same as when we guided for the year back in February. I will also refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nFinally, a topic of great interest to many investors is the impact to our business from tariffs. Biogen currently does not expect a material impact in 2025 from potential tariffs as announced by the administration, US administration on 2 April 2025, even if the exemption for pharmaceuticals were to be removed. This is based on both a significant portion of US revenue being derived from products which have manufacturing operations in the United States, as well as our current global inventory positions. Our guidance range also considers potential retaliatory tariffs from China as announced. However, the US and international tariff landscape remains uncertain, and our guidance does not contemplate any new tariffs that may be announced in the future.\nI will also note that when excluding one-time tax impacts, our tax rate is broadly a function of our business mix and therefore does not serve as a good proxy for estimating potential tariff impacts. Biogen's effective tax rate is a reflection of our US market revenues being almost entirely taxable in the US at the full federal plus state tax rates. We also generate a relatively high percentage of our revenue outside the US, which is taxable in those markets and in the US under the GILTI regime. We will continue to monitor and analyze the current and future US and reciprocal tariff landscape as it evolves. I'll now pass the call over to Chris for some closing comments.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Robin. Again, if I come back to where is Biogen going, you just have to look at our pipeline. We've got another four phase III starts. That's after the phase III start already in AMR. We've got three clinical trial readouts coming. We've got three regulatory decisions coming. One of the other things I'll say is in this first quarter is we did a major restructuring of research, and I'm really quite excited about what we're doing there. As an industry, we rely way too much on late-stage business development. The most cost-effective place to do collaborations is actually preclinically, and we have a goal of signing four to five new research collaborations this year. Just on research, Biogen has been known for breakthrough medicines. In fact, all four products that we launched in 2023 and 2024 are first-in-class, first-ever disease-modifying agents.\nWe go after some of the hardest-to-treat diseases. But one of the problems about being breakthrough is that you're in diseases where a lot of the investment community is not already doing an awful lot of research. If I take AMR, the Antibody-Mediated Rejection, for example, there's really no treatment there today. And so one of the things that I think we feel that we would like to do is do a deeper dive into some of these diseases and pipeline assets, not with the intention of presenting new data, but to just say, \"Okay, what's the competitive landscape? What's Biogen's right to win here? What's the patient journey? What is it going to really take to move the needle on one of these diseases? What's the reimbursement landscape going to be like?\nWhat's the epidemiology?\" If I look at AMR, for example, I think this is a huge opportunity for Biogen. We saw 80% resolution of AMR in phase II trials. We have a high level of confidence in that. But of course, a lot of people are interested in IgAN. What's it going to take to really be interested in IgAN? I spent an entire day with our West Coast hub just on felzartamab. There's a huge amount of things going on there. Even things like all CD38s are not created equally. What are they like? We would like to invite whoever's interested to come to some of these thematic seminars. The first one we're going to hold on 11 June. Hopefully, that'll be the first of a series. It's just meant to be educational and a deeper dive.\nWe'll have some of our top internal experts here on all of these subjects to answer any and all questions. With that, Tim, I'll turn it back to you for Q&A.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. Melinda, can we go to our first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. If you'd like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you require any further follow-up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue. And your first question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the recent LEQEMBI approval in Europe. Can you talk about what the rollout strategy could look like there and your sense of what the reimbursement process and amenability could be? Thanks.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. Well, that is certainly going to take some time. The fact that the approval took a while tells you that there's an awful lot of thought going into that. One of the things about when you launch a first-in-class disease-modifying agent is that you're not displacing anything in a budget. So these types of products are incremental adds to the total healthcare budget of countries. And so that's sometimes where it's easier to launch a product that's kind of a me too that comes in and can simply cannibalize the budget of another product. So this is obviously a significant market in Europe. Europe is an aging continent, even more so than the United States. So there are an awful lot of eligible patients. But we'll be taking that with our partners Eisai, market by market. I do think that also LEQEMBI has run the gauntlet.\nI mean, there has been a full examination of the efficacy, the safety, but also the economic benefit. As you know, the EMA does take into account some aspects of the economic impact. So I think that in some ways, this deep interrogation by all of the countries of the European Union, by the way, I think should actually, if anything, help us as we go into reimbursement because this has been fully examined and fully evaluated. But I think it'll still take some time, and we'll go to some of the countries we'll launch clearly faster, as is the case generally in Europe.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to touch again on LEQEMBI, but this time with the subcutaneous formulation. Maybe remind us how that potential for at-home administration can help accelerate sales in the United States. We're seeing some good uptake, but I think that that could really help get things going further and maybe some of the hurdles that you have to overcome to really get full penetration there. Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nAll right. So the first is subcutaneous for maintenance. And these are patients who have been undergoing biweekly infusions now for 18 months. And so I think there are two aspects for the commercial. First is we are busy focusing on making sure that physicians and patients understand the need to continue on therapy. And there we have long-term extension data, and we have demonstrated that in 36 months after treatment, patients are still doing better on treatment than if they stop treatment. So there's the whole establishment of the maintenance market. But these are also older patients, and it's not always easy to get to in infusion centers. Obviously, we make it easier with once-monthly dosing, but our view is that this is going to be more effective as a long-term chronic therapy if you have a patient-friendly administration like subcutaneous.\nSo I think as a first step, the subcutaneous really helps establish and extends the treatment life of a patient in maintenance. And then, of course, in the initiation phase, that'll be interesting to see. I think in major urban centers, I think we may see that some physicians may want to continue at least in the first few months of therapy on infusion because they're timed with the MRIs to monitor ARIA, and then move to subcutaneous. I can imagine in more rural settings where getting to infusion centers is not as easy for patients that the subcutaneous might even be right from the get-go. So I think it'll depend a little bit on where you are as a patient, but there's no question that this is, again, a simplification of the physician's workload.\nIt's a heavy load to think about the PET scans or the lumbar punctures, going to negotiate for use of the infusion beds, which are often considered to be the domain of the oncologist. Just from a caregiver point of view of bringing the patient to the infusion center, I think this will be welcome by them as well, that they can do this at home. I think this is an enabler for the patient, but also for the physician.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nMelinda, can we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nWe go to Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just following up on Evan's question here, could you just speak to your thoughts on LEQEMBI uptake and growth abroad, not only with subcutaneous maintenance dosing in the second half, but also with full years, Bio's, in vitro diagnostic, which should enter the market as well? Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah, we don't have that much information about the diagnostic. The process to get a diagnostic approved is different, obviously, than a drug. And then the reimbursement situation is also different. I do think the recent report by the Alzheimer's Association highlighted the need for early diagnosis. One of the issues that has, as I think, been in Alzheimer's is that most patients are actually seeing their primary care physician, and it can take quite a long time for the physician to distinguish, \"Is this just part of the normal aging process? Is this some other form of dementia, or is this Alzheimer's?\" And so two or three years can go by, and sometimes even longer before the Alzheimer's diagnostic is done through a referral to a neurologist.\nNow, one of the things that Alzheimer's report also pointed out is that there's a real interest in getting treatment earlier, and that the earlier you can get to a patient before there has been too much neuronal damage or death, the better. And so I think there is a real effort to be done to really get those diagnostics established. And so the benefit really is, I think, twofold. One is hopefully we can get patients on treatment at a much earlier stage of their disease. And we believe, and there's obviously studies ongoing to actually gain the evidence of that. But even the data that we presented at CTAD in 2023 of low tau patients, which is surrogate for early-stage patients, demonstrated that 60% of patients were stable after six months.\nActually, 70% sorry, 70% were stable after six months, and 60% actually showed some level of improvement. So I think the blood-based diagnostics are going to be extremely important. But again, we have to wait and see where those companies are in the regulatory process.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nCan we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. On LEQEMBI, how are you seeing the market parse out between your product and Lilly's Kisunla? Because obviously, there's a very big difference in terms of commercial positioning around finite dosing. And I'm wondering who's going to kind of win that battle. And Chris, you answered an earlier question starting off talking about getting docs to keep patients on therapy. So your product's been on the market now for coming up on two and a half years. Are you actually seeing some prescribers take patients off therapy after a period under the idea that once plaque is gone, you no longer need to give drugs?\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. I mean, I think first, I would say we would really consider the launch of this product to have been September 2023 because that's when we had full approval. We had reimbursement from CMS. In actual fact, we didn't even really get the question on the reimbursement for PET scans clarified till about November of that year. So I think we're still much earlier in that launch phase. To your question on this versus donanemab, it depends on the physician.\nAnd I think we're going to see those who like this idea of potentially saying, \"Well, there's a finite point to this.\" Equally, what we have seen even at the recent ADPD, once you have a maintenance indication and you start to see the data, you start to realize that, well, actually, once you've removed the plaque, you're not done because there is some return of the plaque and potential damage. So there will be obviously a lot of education to be done to demonstrate the importance of continuing on that. But I think at the end of the day, it's largely going to be up to the physician and the patient. There will be patients where donanemab may be the right answer for them. It depends on their fragility, their age, whether they're in a rural setting or an urban setting.\nI think the market ultimately just gets split between us and donanemab. The most important thing for both Lilly, I think, Biogen, and Eisai is that we start to really expand this market. We've got maybe, I don't know, 12,000, 13,000 patients somewhere in there on treatment, less for donanemab, but they will get there. But when you consider the number of patients who desperately need treatment, we're still only treating a small fraction. I think that's really got to be the focus of all the companies in this space is to really ensure that more patients benefit from these disease-modifying treatments.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nCan we go to the next question, please, Melinda?\n\nOperator\n\nNext up is Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Thanks so much for the question. I just would love a bit more elaboration on latest thoughts on business development in terms of the size and the scopes of deals you're considering. It's obviously been a pretty volatile market out there. And I'm just wondering if that's changing your views at all or the range of opportunities that might be available to Biogen. Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah, thanks for that, Chris. I mean, I think there has been a shift even perhaps in the last, I would say, four to six weeks in a couple of ways. I mean, valuation is one thing, but you're still really focused on getting the right thing. And what I think has changed is you have a lot of healthcare investors who are facing a lot of pressure from LPs. And I think they are looking for liquidity. And I think we've had a lot of companies who've not really wanted to do much because valuations are low. But we're also finding that there's a lot of companies who are struggling to get financing. So I think if you're looking to acquire, I think there might be a little bit more of an ease in actually getting at least into a discussion.\nBut I think even from a collaboration point of view, I think one of the things we're going to see, and I think this is also where we're doing this in the early research collaborations. I think companies will be able to provide some of the funding as some of the venture capital and some of the other sources of funding dry up for other companies. And so there are opportunities in there. It still requires an awful lot of patience and discipline to work your way through and find companies that work together. I do think Biogen is actually well positioned. One of the things I'm particularly proud of is we have this West Coast hub, which is essentially the HI-Bio team. And we have been able to retain virtually everybody in that HI-Bio team.\nJane has hired our head of immunology, came from BMS, who's out there on the West Coast, and we're building out that team. So I think Biogen, just because of our own biotech roots, is a company that knows how to do collaborations, and I think can be a trusted partner in this. So I do think this is an opportunity. But again, we look at a lot of things, but even in this environment, you still have to stay disciplined.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go to Michael Yee with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask Priya about the AHEAD 3-45 study. I know that you've guided to a 2028 readout. Your competitor is also guiding to a readout, although I think there's an assumption that they may come earlier. Can you just talk about maybe one or two points about your positioning versus that study and particularly what would get you extremely confident that that's going to work and/or a readout? Because I know that you have an interim, but I'm going to assume you're not going to take that interim. Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes. Thanks, Mike. So overall, I would say I'd like to start by saying that with Clarity AD, we established that LEQEMBI clears plaque, and that translates to clinical benefit. Now, with regards to the preclinical Alzheimer's disease area, it's a big spectrum. And we believe that AHEAD 3-45 is truly positioned to provide a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of how LEQEMBI can preserve cognition across the full spectrum of presymptomatic AD. And the reason for that is that we are testing it in two parallel trials. The first one is AHEAD 3, which is about 400 subjects. And really, by the inclusion criteria, are 20 to 40 centiloids of amyloid. And then the other trial is greater than 40 centiloids, which is the AHEAD 45 amyloid levels. And there we're looking at whether it can prevent cognitive decline.\nSo AHEAD 3 is looking at, can we stop the accumulation of amyloid? Have amyloid PET as the primary endpoint. And then AHEAD 45 is looking at preventing cognitive decline. And we have a very sensitive clinical endpoint called the PAC5, along with amyloid and tau PET. I think in contrast, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 is really evaluating whether donanemab can slow clinical progression in a mixed population. And this is based on their baseline CDR global scores. So true presymptomatic is about 55%, and they have included 45% of symptomatic patients. So these studies are actually quite different. And we are looking at the entire range of presymptomatic patients with varying degrees of amyloid. We do expect we fully enroll. We do expect to read out in 2028. We always reserve the optionality of looking at data earlier or such. We're not commenting on that right now.\nWe are looking at a readout in 2028.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. And I think if I could just from a commercial point of view, I do think the AHEAD study will actually answer much more of the question that physicians will be looking to ask. I mean, if you're in presymptomatic patients, these are otherwise healthy people, right? And the risk-benefit equation becomes different at that point. And there is ARIA that is associated with both products. So you're going to have to answer the question about the risk-benefit of treating earlier and at what level of amyloid burden. And I think that's going to be useful because the blood-based diagnostics will tell you that if there is a presence of amyloid, they will not tell you about how much.\nSo at some point, you sort of say 55, you had a positive blood test, someone's going to send you for a PET scan to see how much amyloid you have. And let's say you're at 50. Well, are you in a watch-and-wait mode, or do you actually treat? And unless you've actually done the study of looking at the full spectrum of amyloid burden, I'm not sure that physicians are going to feel comfortable about treating. So I do think actually AHEAD 3 and 45 are going to be really landmark studies in Alzheimer's.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nCan we go to the next question, please, Melinda?\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\n\nMike DiFiore\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, this is Mike DiFiore on for Umer. Thanks so much for taking our question. Again, one on LEQEMBI. Lilly's drug did about $21 million of sales in Q1, which is its second full quarter of launch. And this tracks slightly ahead of LEQEMBI sales at the same time point. So my question is, has Biogen and Eisai perhaps paved the way for Lilly in terms of opening up healthcare infrastructure? And maybe perhaps could you speak to any competitive dynamics at play now that you're roughly 18 months into launch? Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen",
    "content2": "Well, I think the answer is probably yes. Clearly, there's been a lot of hard work, particularly the IDNs, to work through all the treatment pathways, protocols, and treatment regimens that are needed. And so now we're into a question of lecanemab versus donanemab in those questions. And as I said earlier, I think there will be cases where physicians are looking at both products. I think it'll be a question of who gets initiated. I don't think we're seeing any switching going on here. So it's really a question of which one are you going to start on and then stay on. I think the bigger question is, can we actually collectively grow the market? And that's really what's most important. And I don't think we particularly want to get into just trying to duke it out over market share in a relatively still small market.\nThere are a lot of patients out there, and we are not yet doing a full service to patients who are suffering. And so the more that we can get more centers up and running and better education, the better it will be for patients and actually for both companies.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's go to the next one, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the FDA under the new administration. I know you made some comments about your Dravet program moving into a phase III. So just wondering if you could comment high level, number one, on your interactions with FDA and if there have been any changes to the review teams, things like that. But then also in some of these rare diseases, do you think this FDA is going to be advancing very rapidly and be more favorable to the industry in terms of thinking about maybe surrogate endpoints? Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes, thank you. Overall, I'll just make a high-level statement that based on our interactions on review meetings and requests, we're not really seeing any changes at a high level. Currently, we remain on track with our engagements. With regards to Dravet syndrome, I think that obviously the data that we saw during diligence, and which I spoke to as well today, for us, that has been very compelling. That has several aspects to it. First of all, this population, although it was a small open-label trial, I think what was important about it was that these patients were on standard of care. Unfortunately, the burden of disease is high in Dravet, and they have a number of seizures, sometimes seven to 10 a week. They are on multiple medications, anti-seizure medications.\nIn fact, we saw the impact of zorevunersen on top of standard of care. So the impact that we saw was 87% seizure reduction on top of background standard of care, full standard of care. And then that was durable out to about 76% when you look out six months. So the data was important. But the other aspect of the question that you asked is that Stoke had already engaged with FDA, Europe, and Japan. So we have regulator input, which we have evaluated carefully. We have agreement on the approach and design to the phase III EMPEROR trial. So we remain fairly confident that this is the right trial to conduct.\nWe remain encouraged about where we are in our engagement, not only with the FDA, but global regulators, and that the design is appropriate to really give us that answer on what we hope will be a disease-modifying therapy impact in this population.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nBut I think to your broader question, I think certainly right now at Biogen, we have not really seen any delays in our interactions with the FDA. And I personally am encouraged by some of the more recent comments by the new commissioner about particular ultra rare, and thinking about surrogate markers, and making sure patients get drugs earlier. And I think he seems to be more interested in innovating some of the process. I think about his statements on reducing the use of animals in studies, for example, and use of AI. So there's certainly a lot of change going on at the FDA, and we're watching very carefully. And obviously, there have been some key leaders who have left, and some reduction in staff. But as I say, so far, at least from a Biogen point of view, we haven't seen any adverse effect to that.\nPerhaps some of the new perspectives of the new commissioner, Makary, could actually be helpful to us.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. I know it's a busy morning, so maybe we can squeeze one last question in here. Our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe go next to Geoff Meacham with Citibank.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citibank\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. For Chris or Robin, on manufacturing, Biogen has historically had a lot of capacity in the US going back to the original expectations in Alzheimer's. I guess the question is, as we see more companies in biopharma announce plans to onshore capacity, do you guys view your own capacity or resources differently? I wonder if there's a short-term opportunity to partner that's not in the model. Obviously, all, of course, depends on what you have in excess. Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. We've actually recently, our main facility in Solothurn, for example, we've recently, we're actually doing CDMO business to absorb capacity. Obviously, that doesn't help for someone looking in the US. In RTP, we actually do quite a lot of manufacturing already for third-party companies. And I think even before I joined Biogen, I knew of the reputation of our RTP facility. It's a very high-quality, very efficient site. So yes, I think we certainly will be open and looking for opportunities on that front.\n\nRobin Kramer\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nYeah. We have a good mix in both facilities between our own product manufacturing as well as those for partners.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nGreat. Well, thanks for your time, everybody. Really appreciate it. And if you've got more questions later today, just reach out to the IR team. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call and Business Update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one on your telephone keypad. Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. If you require any further follow-up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue.\nToday's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Power, you may begin your conference.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Jennifer, and good morning, and welcome to Biogen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. During this call, we make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the investors' section of biogen.com. We've also posted slides to our website that we'll be using during the call.\nOn today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher, Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development, and Mike McDonnell, Chief Financial Officer. We'll make some opening comments and then move to Q&A. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we'll kindly ask that you limit yourself to just one question. With that, I'll hand over to Chris.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody. Perhaps before we get started, I'd just like to note that this is Mike McDonnell's last quarterly presentation as CFO of Biogen. Mike, I believe this is your 97th quarter as a publicly quoted CFO, so congratulations on that amazing career. I'll just take the opportunity to thank you. You've been a terrific partner and team member. It's been great working with you, and we will miss you. We, of course, are joined here also by Robin Kramer. I'm also proud to say that we've been able to promote from within. It's a great source of pride that we have that level of talent within the organization.\nLet's turn to Q4. As you all know, we have been faced with increased competition for our multiple sclerosis franchise. Really, all of our priorities are thinking about how do we now build a new Biogen? How do we build a new phase of growth? We are focused really around three core priorities.\nThe first are clearly the four products that we launched last year: Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia, depression, and ALS. Each of those products is not only a first-in-class but first disease-modifying agent in each of these diseases. Now, that's a source of pride in the level of innovation that Biogen is capable of. Equally, from a commercial point of view, this is a significant challenge since the level of education when you're a pioneer in an area is so much greater. We'll come back and talk a little bit more about that.\nThe next is we have really reprioritized the pipeline. It's certainly been my experience over the years that focusing on a number of key projects is core to business success. I'm particularly grateful to both Priya Singhal and Jane Grogan because they have both really, I think, cleaned out the pipeline for development in Priya's case and research in Jane's case.\nWe're actually excited now by the products that are in there. We've got a number of key developments that will start reading out in 2026. We think this is a multi-billion-dollar portfolio, and we're probably one of the few companies that can look at a pipeline that could be more than our current biopharmaceutical business when it gets to peak sales, if it all obviously comes to market.\nThe third point, of course, is we have redesigned the company with a reduction of operating expenses, not just saving costs for the sake of cost, but the ability to release resources for investing in growth. That's what we're continuing to do. We're excited about our pipeline, but we've also freed up an awful lot of cash flow, as you'll see later. That cash flow, we're investing for more substrate in growth. Now, Dan, please, next slide.\nThe race really that we are faced with is seeing the erosion of our multiple sclerosis product revenue. I'm particularly happy to see in 2024 that the revenue from our launch products really offset, more than offset the decline in our multiple sclerosis product revenue. Indeed, when you actually look at total revenue declined by $160 million and you note that contract manufacturing declined by $247 million, it meant that really our core pharma business actually grew. That's for the first time in four years.\nThat's really what we're all about in the near term, is trying to make sure that the revenue can exceed the multiple sclerosis product decline. Multiple sclerosis product decline is obviously driven by a number of factors going forward, including the timing of a Tysabri biosimilar in the US and timing of Tecfidera generics in Europe. Go to the next slide, please, Dan.\nAs I said, we've got actually four very innovative pioneering products. Leqembi, we'll come on and talk about in some detail. Skyclarys and Friedreich's ataxia, again, the very first treatment for Friedreich's ataxia. We have been able to determine from basically medical claims data that there are approximately 4,800 patients in the US. That's about what we thought.\nOne of the complexities is that it's harder to find these patients because you could have a primary care physician in a rural setting that has one single patient, and you have to go find them. We're talking to primary care physicians, talking to cardiologists, talking to pediatricians. It's quite a large prescriber base for a very narrow patient population.\nThat, of course, is the core of what rare diseases are. I remember years ago when we acquired Genzyme when I was at Sanofi, and the marketing folks were saying, \"Our marketing strategy is looking for needles and haystacks.\" That is exactly what rare disease is all about and it's what Biogen is also very good at. Of course, today, we've got a lot more technology. We can use tools such as AI and genetic testing to help find those patients. By its very nature, it is unfortunately not going to be the nice smooth progression quarter-on-quarter. That said, we're particularly proud to say that we have been able to double the number of patients on treatment in the past year.\nNot all of those are yet being reimbursed. We are able to get a lot of patients on drug and then negotiate with governments, particularly in Europe, to get the reimbursement. Once we do that, the patients flip from being free goods patients to actually revenue-generating treatments. There's always, in each country, a number of patients who are diagnosed who have been waiting for treatment, and you can get those quite easily. There are a number of older patients who actually have lived with this disease for 30, 40 years. They're the ones we actually have to go hunt for.\nWe will see another growth driver this year in that we expect to get approval for Skyclarys in Latin America. I was in Brazil last year, and there are quite a number of patients in Latin America. As we started with the US, we moved to Europe, and then we're moving to South America, and indeed areas of the Middle East. We expect to see continued steady growth out of Skyclarys. But again, I can appreciate that it's going to be hard for some of you to model on a quarterly basis.\nZurzuvae was a very nice launch last year and certainly exceeded our expectations. One of the things that was different from our expectations was that the main prescribers are actually OB/GYN. We had actually been targeting originally high-prescribing psychiatrists. We still see some of those, but as you can see, 80% of the prescriptions are driven by OB/GYNs. This is also an area where you could have potentially more people who have ever prescribed for PPD than you actually have patients. Again, targeting and thinking about multi-channel marketing and commercial approaches are extremely important.\nWe have filed in Europe and would hope to see an approval sometime later this year. Qalsody is not necessarily a big revenue generator, but this is really a breakthrough treatment in ALS. This is the first time we've been able to demonstrate that neurofilament can really help predict drugs early in development as to whether or not they are likely to work or not. That allows just the whole research and development in ALS to be accelerated. We're particularly proud of that. The impact on patients is absolutely extraordinary. While we may not be making a big impact on revenue, we're certainly making a big impact on patients' lives. Go to the next slide, please, Dan.\nNow, I showed this slide in JPMorgan, and there were several investors who looked at that chart and said, \"This is not the chart of a small product.\" We've all been in this business and looked at a lot of launch curves, and we all know that we like to see an acceleration in the curve, but any curve that goes from bottom left to upper right is, in my books, good unless we're talking about operating expenses. This is good, steady, quarter-on-quarter progress. We have seen some questions on the ex-US launch. Clearly, the ex-US launch is contributing more than we have seen in prior launches in other areas.\nI think part of that is, first, I think Eisai is extremely strong in Asia, and they are leading that launch there. Second, I think the single-payer system removes a lot of the obstacles that we're dealing with in the US. When you have a single payer, you're not having to negotiate quite so much in terms of PET scans, MRIs, and infusion beds. That has facilitated the progress. It's as strong in China as it is in Japan, not necessarily in patient numbers, but we're seeing very strong growth in China. That is a cash-pay market and goes to really a demonstration of how people value the importance of Leqembi. We'll go to the next chart, please.\nNow, I talked about some of those obstacles, and we certainly see that making this easier for both patients and physicians is going to accelerate the launch. We have a number of these catalysts. The first one has already been achieved. We have Leqembi IV maintenance that's now FDA approved. We now have the first patients who are hitting that 18-month mark. They've cleared their plaque.\nAs the data have demonstrated, you've got to stay on treatment. Otherwise, some forms of the plaque actually come back. We have demonstrated three-year data to show that actually staying on treatment, patients do better than those who stop treatment. That's an important message because our competition is actually not able to say that. This is also important for the education of the disease. It's not just about plaque clearance. It's about maintaining that clearance.\nThe second is really the introduction of blood-based diagnostics. Certainly, Labcorp and Quest continue to see rising sales of these diagnostics. What I think will really make a difference is getting FDA approval for some of these diagnostics with an evidence base that will give physicians the confidence to be able to confirm diagnosis without the need for a PET scan or a lumbar puncture. Again, this is something that could not only facilitate the work of the neurologist, but we might also be able to see this being used increasingly to triage patients.\nSomething like 50% of patients who actually manage to get into a neurologist are actually not eligible for treatment because they're too far advanced in their disease. If we could actually triage some of these patients, particularly at the primary care level, then we can actually get a higher quotient of patients who visit a neurologist actually being eligible for treatment.\nThe subcutaneous form for maintenance, now we have a PDUFA date on 31 August. That, again, will really facilitate the journey both for the patient as well as for the physician, no longer needing the infusion beds, and patients can actually take the drug from the comfort of their own home. A major game changer we see is the subcutaneous for initiation, which we expect to have in the first half of next year. That obviously would also facilitate that for the same reasons of not having to deal with infusion beds, and patients can have that in the comfort of their own home.\nThe AHEAD 3-45 study has fully recruited. We expect a readout in 2028. This is a landmark study because this is where we could see the promise of potentially prevention of Alzheimer's. We know that before patients actually exhibit symptoms, they've been accumulating plaques in their brains for many, many years. Unfortunately, a lot of damage is done already by the time patients actually exhibit symptoms.\nIf we can get patients earlier, we think that we can actually have even better efficacy. In fact, Priya is going to show shortly, again, the low tau patients, which is a marker for earlier-stage patients. There we see dramatically improved efficacy versus just the 27% on the CDR Sum of Boxes that was demonstrated in the Clarity study. Next slide, please.\nThose are the four products. Clearly, we're also looking at our pipeline. I think there are three key areas in this to look at. The first is continued investment and commitment to Alzheimer's. We gather some of the top leading experts in Alzheimer's from around the world. They're the ones who are telling us, one, that nobody is really doing so much research in a broad area of modalities as Bioge. The other is they are extremely excited about the opportunity to reduce tau and the impact that that could have on Alzheimer's.\nAlzheimer's is going to be a core franchise for Biogen for decades to come. We had very positive data on dapirolizumab back in September. We've already initiated the second phase III. We also have litifilimab in both CLE and SLE. We got a nice lupus portfolio of assets coming along. I'd remind everybody, yes, people are looking at a lot of potential competitors in phase I, phase II, but out of the dozens and dozens and dozens of molecules that entered the clinic, only three molecules have ever demonstrated a positive phase III result. Two are already on the market, and dapirolizumab is the third.\nWe know that you can get excited about a lot of things, but it's not until you actually see phase III results that you can really have conviction. That's a potentially significant market and fits nicely with Biogen because we can take a lot of the learnings from MS and apply that to lupus. Of course, the third area are really these autoantibodies. We have our anti-CD38. We expect to enter into three phase III trials and three separate indications with antibody-mediated resistance, the IgAN, the PMN. We have very compelling phase II results here.\nThere are no guarantees anytime in research and development, but I think we feel particularly excited about felzartamab and the potential that this could have in rare kidney disease. Of course, then we have a whole phase of readouts coming along, and I think that will become the story of Biogen as we get increasingly more data and people can gain increasing confidence and excitement, share our excitement in our pipeline. With that, I think I'm going to let's continue the story on R&D, Priya, and I'll turn it over to you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you, Chris. Biogen's development organization had another very productive quarter. We achieved several important milestones across key strategic areas for the company. I would like to begin with immunology, where in collaboration with UCB, as Chris mentioned, we initiated the second phase III study for dapi pegol in SLE. This follows the positive readout of the first phase III study and sharing of detailed study results as a late breaker at the ACR annual meeting last year.\nDapi pegol, as Chris mentioned, is only the third agent with a positive global phase III study in SLE. Additionally, felzartamab was granted orphan drug designation in the EU for both solid organ transplantation and IgAN nephropathy. We believe this designation, which is intended to support development of treatments with significant unmet medical need, underscores the potential for felzartamab to become a meaningful new therapy for serious immune-mediated diseases like AMR, IgAN, and PMN globally.\nIn rare disease, we continued unlocking new geographies for Skyclarys in Friedreich's ataxia and Qalsody in SOD1-ALS. Leveraging the results of the Skyclarys positive MOXIe trial, we obtained approval in Chile and currently have 13 additional regulatory filings under review. This includes additional filings in Latin America, where we expect regulatory decisions this year in countries such as Brazil and Argentina as we continue our global rollout.\nImportantly, we also took significant steps towards expanding the value of key portfolio products for patients. In SMA, regulatory filings for high-dose nusinersen have now been accepted in the US and EU, and we expect an FDA decision in September of this year. In Alzheimer's disease, we recently received FDA approval for Leqembi less frequent IV maintenance dosing. This is both a significant step for Leqembi and a meaningful advancement in the evolution of Alzheimer's treatment more broadly.\nI would like to briefly review why there is an urgency to treat now and why maintenance is important based on Leqembi data that we have obtained to date. First, the Clarity AD study is unique in that it did not exclude patients based upon tau brain pathology. Therefore, we have placebo-controlled clinical trial data across the full early Alzheimer's disease population, including individuals with no and low tau, which represent the earliest stages of AD. In this population, 76% of patients showed no decline, and 60% showed clinical improvement at 18 months as assessed by CDR Sum of Boxes.\nWhat this means is that in over 3/4 of early AD patients, their disease was stabilized, and more than 1/2 the patients showed improved symptoms when treated with Leqembi. The reason why this is important is that this data suggests that patients treated early in their disease can see a profound benefit, which underscores the importance of initiating treatment early. Furthermore, this data also supports the potential of our ongoing pre-symptomatic AHEAD 3-45 trial.\nNow that I've shown you why early treatment initiation is important, let me remind you why the new maintenance IV approval is also very critical. That is because data shows that Alzheimer's does not stop after plaque removal. Importantly, prior data from the Leqembi phase II study and its open-label extension show that discontinuation of treatment is associated with re-accumulation of Alzheimer's biomarkers, including amyloid plaques, and importantly, a reversion back to the placebo rate of clinical decline.\nWith its differentiated mechanism of action, we believe Leqembi is uniquely positioned as it is the only disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's today to show additional benefit with continued treatment after plaque reduction. As you can see from this slide, the three-year data from the Clarity AD study and its open-label extension support the potential for long-term benefit to patients by showing that continued Leqembi treatment resulted in a doubling of the clinical benefit observed at 18 months as compared to a matched natural history cohort.\nWith these findings in mind, we are working with Eisai to deliver additional options for patients with the aim of maximizing both the convenience and the clinical benefit of Leqembi. This includes a subcutaneous formulation with the potential for at-home administration to further add to patient optionality and convenience. For subcutaneous maintenance dosing, we now have a PDUFA date of August 2025. Next year, in 2026, we aim to introduce subcutaneous dosing for treatment initiation, which we believe will allow even more patients to get started on therapy.\nBuilding upon the encouraging results we obtained in the no or low tau population in Clarity AD, we continue to advance evaluating the AHEAD 3-45, evaluating Leqembi in individuals who have amyloid plaque pathology in the brain, but before the onset of symptoms, which has the potential to further expand the use of Leqembi.\nTurning now to the pipeline, we have previously discussed our efforts to augment our pipeline with the objective of rebalancing the risk profile and investing to win in key areas of expected future growth. As a result, we have focused our development efforts on a smaller set of clinical stage programs that we believe are high conviction and well-positioned to deliver a regular cadence of pivotal readouts and potential launches. This includes key late-stage programs that have the potential, as you see on this slide, to deliver innovation to benefit patients across Alzheimer's and immunology.\nWe will continue to remain disciplined in our approach as we continue to assess inflection points for our internal development pipeline, but also as we evaluate potential external innovation opportunities that we believe can help support Biogen's goal of sustainable growth. With that, I would now like to hand the call over to Mike for a financial update.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Priya. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to begin by providing some highlights from the reported results. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, which represents 3% growth from the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.44, and that's 17% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year of 2024, total revenue of $9.7 billion represents a decline of 2% from 2023, consistent with our most recent guidance of a low single-digit decline. Full year 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $16.47. That's 12% higher than the full year 2023, also consistent with our most recent guidance range of $16.10-16.60.\nEPS growth and operating income expansion in both the fourth quarter and full year was supported by our Fit for Growth and R&D prioritization initiatives. We are pleased that this performance allowed us to generate $722 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which brought us to $2.7 billion for the full year, and that's an improvement of $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion generated in 2023.\nNow I'll turn to a few comments on revenue and commercial dynamics from the fourth quarter. Our MS product revenue declined roughly 8% at actual currency and 9% at constant currency as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. That was driven primarily by competition in the space, partially offset by some seasonal channel dynamics. Interferons continued to be impacted by competition as patients transitioned to higher efficacy therapies, and Tecfidera continued to be impacted by generic competition globally.\nTysabri has seen some impacts from a biosimilar entrant in Europe, and although a biosimilar has not yet launched in the US, we continue to see competition increasing in the high efficacy class. Vumerity saw an increase in demand in the quarter and also benefited from some seasonal channel dynamics.\nNext, our rare disease franchise produced revenue of $535 million in the fourth quarter, and that represented growth of 13% at actual currency and 15% at constant currency from the fourth quarter of 2023. Global Skyclarys revenue in the fourth quarter was $102 million, an increase of 83% versus the fourth quarter of 2023, with nearly double the number of patients on therapy. US Skyclarys revenue in the fourth quarter was $71 million. We continued to add patients in the quarter, but revenue was sequentially impacted by an inventory build in the third quarter that was drawn down in the fourth quarter, as well as some Medicare discount dynamics.\nGlobal Spinraza revenue of $421 million in the fourth quarter grew 2% year-over-year, including growth in the US of 6% year-over-year. We are encouraged by the performance here and look forward to a potential future launch of the high-dose option. Zurzuvae delivered approximately $23 million of revenue in the quarter, and that was driven by an increase in demand, partially offset by channel dynamics.\nWe again saw steady sequential growth for Leqembi, with Q4 global in-market sales booked by Eisai of approximately $87 million, and that's up approximately 30% sequentially from Q3 2024. Leqembi Q4 in-market sales in the US were $50 million, and that's up roughly 28% sequentially from Q3 2024.\nI'll now turn to a few comments on dynamics from a few key expense lines. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved 300 basis points in Q4 as compared to Q4 2023, and that was driven primarily by lower idle capacity charges. Q4 non-GAAP core operating expense, or R&D plus SG&A expense, increased 4% year-over-year as the benefits from our R&D prioritization and Fit for Growth initiatives allowed us to mostly absorb incremental spend associated with our launches.\nNon-GAAP other expense was $72 million in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by net interest expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.44 in the fourth quarter, representing growth of 17% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Now a brief update on our balance sheet. We generated $2.7 billion of free cash flow in 2024 due to strong operating income. Please note that the timing of certain cash tax payments in 2024 also benefited free cash flow. We ended 2024 with $2.4 billion of cash and roughly $3.9 billion of net debt and continue to believe that our balance sheet remains strong and allows us to continue to invest in both internal and external growth opportunities.\nTurning now to our full year 2025 guidance, ranges, and assumptions. We expect full year 2025 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15.25 and $16.25. This guidance range, which is based upon FX rates on 7 February 2025, includes a $0.35 EPS headwind from foreign exchange when compared to average exchange rates in 2024.\nTotal revenue for 2025 is expected to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage. This is driven primarily by an increased decline in our MS business as compared to 2024. The pressure on our MS business is expected to be driven by potential biosimilar entry for Tysabri in the US this year and potential generic entry for Tecfidera in certain European markets. We expect this decline to be partially offset by continued strong and increasing revenue growth from our new product launches. Please note this revenue range also includes a roughly 1% headwind from foreign exchange.\nIn 2025, we expect an impact from Medicare Part D redesign at the total company level to be limited, approximately $50 million-100 million. We expect approximately 1/3 of this impact to be related to Skyclarys, with the remainder coming from MS. On operating expenses, we remain on track to deliver the $1 billion of gross and $800 million of net savings from our Fit for Growth initiative by the end of this year. With this in mind, we expect full year 2025 combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to total approximately $3.9 billion. As it will take time for the savings to crystallize, we expect to see higher OpEx in the beginning of the year.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin percentage to remain relatively flat in 2025 as compared to 2024. On the non-operating side of expenses, I would highlight the components of our non-GAAP other income and expense line. This line includes interest expense on our debt and some other expenses, partially offset by interest income on our cash balances. For full year 2025, we expect other income and expense to be a net expense of approximately $180 million-220 million.\nFinally, some additional considerations as you think about your models. As has been the case in previous years, we expect Q1 to be pressured due to seasonality driven by higher discounts and allowances, as well as channel dynamics in the US, and that'll mostly impact our MS business. I would also note with regard to Fampyra that we terminated the license and collaboration agreement effective 1 January 2025.\nAs I just mentioned, our current year guidance takes account of the stronger dollar today compared with the same time last year. For modeling purposes, each cent change in the euro versus the US dollar impacts revenue by approximately $15 million. I would also refer you to the current slide as well as our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nIn closing, we welcome Robin Kramer as Biogen CFO, following my retirement later this quarter. This orderly transition plan has been in process for some time now, and I have full confidence that Robin will be a great CFO. I'm excited about Biogen's future and will remain a supporter and shareholder of Biogen in the years to come. With that, we will now open the call up for questions.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. Jennifer, can we go to the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Just as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you require any further follow-up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. What is your latest thinking on the capacity preference and potential timelines for external BD? In terms of your growth outlook, just help us understand the balance between the existing pipeline and the assets you could bring in. Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThanks, Salveen. I think we'll get Mike to give you an update on capacity. As I said, we are very excited about the pipeline that we have, but I think one of the things that we'd like to do is continue to reinforce that pipeline. Over the years, I've come to the conclusion that you can never have enough pipeline. First element is we've done a major restructuring of research because I think as companies in our industry, it's very expensive to bring in late-stage assets. We would like to have research be our primary source of innovation, obviously internally, but also externally.\nI think we have completely restructured research to create the financial capacity as well as the talent capacity to do more collaborations and bring assets in, particularly pre-GLP talks. Beyond that, we are looking at virtually every phase, the early phase development right now, I would say Priya probably would agree with me that our early stage development pipeline is still relatively thin. Even if we can find things in phase III, if it's got a really solid phase II, I'm not big on taking a lot of risk on phase III clinical trials because that gets expensive. In terms of acquisitions, we have been migrating into new areas such as immunology and rare diseases.\nIf we can find acquisitions that can bolster our positions in that, we will do so. We don't have a particular size that we're looking for. It could be late-stage development. It could be early-stage commercial. The one thing it has to do is make financial sense. I think where we are as a company, we don't need to be taking a huge amount of risk on acquisitions. That said, we always have about at least 15-20 different projects that we're looking at at any one time. As you know, you have to look at 100 things before you find something that is of interest. Mike, maybe you want to talk about capacity?\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nYeah. Salveen, on capacity, the balance sheet remains in excellent shape. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash on hand. The EBITDA run rate is north of $3 billion a year. With $6.3 billion of gross debt and $3.9 billion of net debt, you're in the zip code of maybe 2x gross and 1.5x net. We were very pleased with the free cash flow results this year in 2020 or last year, I should say 2024, at $2.7 billion. That cash balance will continue to grow.\nWhen you look at the modest amount of leverage, the $2.4 billion of cash on hand, and the growing free cash flow, the balance sheet is in an excellent position. As Chris said, the plan will be to stay very disciplined and only do things that make good financial sense, but we've got significant capacity to do a series of smaller things or perhaps a larger thing if it does make good financial sense.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Mike. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Priya, you mentioned that on the Leqembi slide, that one of the important developments is the potential for blood-based diagnostics. My understanding is that that's coming this year. Can you walk through how important that is in terms of any bottlenecks and specifically whether that totally would be able to replace PET or how that actually works since diagnostics are a little bit complicated? Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes. Thanks, Mike. Overall, I think that accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and confirmation of amyloid remains very important. It is the entry point for the care pathway here so it's important. I think with the advent of the anti-amyloid therapies, we've seen amazing momentum there. As Chris mentioned, we have tests available today that are at triage level.\nThe question here is, what is going to be the availability in the near term for an in vitro diagnostic approved by the FDA that can be used widely and can also be reimbursed and give physicians and neurologists confidence that they can actually trust that outcome and that result versus a PET? We think that this is likely going to happen in the near term. Fujirebio has already filed. We know there are a couple of others like C2N and Roche that are working on these IVDs or in vitro diagnostics. One was already filed. Fujirebio filed last year. We believe that usually the timeframe is about six months.\nI think the next stage will be generating data so that payers and others are confident that it can adequately represent the Medicare population, which tends to be the broader population. I think concordance is important, as is reimbursement, but we think this is moving really fast, and we think we'll see quite a few milestones occur in the near term.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Priya. Let's go to the next question, please, Jennifer.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. On your spend guidance, you're saying $3.9 billion combined R&D and SG&A, which is about $200 million lower than consensus. Revenues are also a little bit lower than consensus, so it offsets each other. My question is, how much does the Royalty Pharma deal take out of the R&D line in 2025 specifically? I know it's $250 million in the aggregate that they'll fund, but what's that relief to 2025 R&D? On Royalty Pharma, can we expect Biogen to do more of these off-balance sheet types of transactions with pipeline programs over the next one to two years? Thank you.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nTim, Mike speaking. On the Royalty Pharma transaction, our current expectation is that the $200 million that we would receive in 2025 from Royalty Pharma would be accounted for as a reduction to R&D expense. That would be a dollar-for-dollar reduction that's in the mix of our guidance.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nJust in terms of other deals, the remuneration to those providing the financing is usually through royalties. It's not easy to make work for every product. I think at the moment, we look at this as a one-off transaction, but it is a useful model to take risk off the table and be able to spread the investment across more assets. It's essentially a way of getting more shots on goal.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chris. Let's go to the next one, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On Skyclarys, can you elaborate a little bit more on the dynamics you're seeing in the US? Are there ways to accelerate patient identification to meaningfully grow revenue there, or should we be expecting this to be an ex-US international growth product? How big are the hurdles in terms of reimbursement outside the US? Thanks.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nWithin the US, I think there have been already a number of creative approaches. One is using AI and looking across social media to be able to identify where patients are. As I said before, there's quite a large number of potential prescribers you could go to. The question is, how do you zero that down to a geography and a type of physician that makes the visit efficient?\nWe've used the AI. Obviously, whenever you develop a treatment for a disease, there's a greater interest in diagnosing it. I think one of the things that we're seeing is a much greater use of genetic testing. Genetic testing does have a cost, and physicians have not always been interested in using it if it wasn't going to lead to a treatment. Now that Skyclarys is there, we are seeing that increased utilization.\nNow, the final thing is using multi- and omnichannel marketing to be able to reach physicians just to educate them about what is Friedreich's ataxia. There are also multiple ataxias out there. That's where the genetic testing can become important. When you listen to the patient journeys, it can take often three, four years before a patient gets a definitive diagnosis. A lot of particularly younger people are just thought to be clumsy for a period of time and then progressively lose mobility. It takes a while because there are a lot of physicians who've never even heard of, as I said, Friedreich's ataxia. That's where the education is needed.\nI would say today, with the technology we have, we have a lot of tools that we didn't have even 15 years ago, but it is still finding patient by patient. We look at how many patients we found every week. The reimbursement isn't really an issue in the US. There are hurdles to it. This is where Biogen is particularly good. We have a very adept group that can help patients navigate the reimbursement system.\nIn Europe, I don't think we're necessarily seeing any issues of reimbursement. It's mostly getting through the whole process, presenting the cost-effectiveness data. We are very encouraged by the uptake. Once you have uptake, then that's a good demonstration of the value of the medicine when it comes to discussing things with reimbursing countries. It'll be progressive. I think there are 10 countries today in Europe which reimburse. Every quarter, we'll be adding more countries. The same will be true ex-Europe in Latin America, for example.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nGo to the next question, please, Jennifer.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to you, Marc Goodman with Leerink Partners.\n\nMarc Goodman\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYeah, good morning. Could you give us a little more flavor on what's happened with Spinraza in the US and ex-US, just dynamics and how much inventory is mattering and what's happening with pricing? A little more color there. Thanks.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nI'll let Mike take the inventory question. Spinraza, this is a very competitive market with a very limited number of patients. You've got a gene therapy, an oral therapy, and an intrathecal therapy all competing for a relatively small patient number. There are actually quite a number of patients who have not been diagnosed or treated. We tend to be in younger patients, but there is actually a much larger adult patient population. Getting at those is a lot like the same process that I just described for Friedreich's ataxia, so we are doing that.\nThe interesting thing is, how do you compete in a market like that? We've all grown up in this business, and we say, \"Okay, one pill a day beats two pills a day. A pill beats an injection.\" The actual reality is, in a lot of these devastating diseases, it's efficacy that matters. That's really the story of Spinraza. The high dose, I think, will be important because you can get to the therapeutic levels of drug that you need much faster, and in a neurodegenerative disease, that's extremely important. We will be able to cut the number of loading doses, if you like, from four to two, and then you go to three injections per year.\nOne of the things that I think will be important is we are developing a device that hopefully will hit the market about, I think, 2026, Priya. It's a port that you can insert under the skin pretty much anywhere on the body, but certainly around the abdomen as an example. It has tiny catheters that lead to the spinal column. That means that you can actually just do the injection directly under the skin.\nThat has had huge patient-positive response. That could actually make intrathecal injections a whole lot more patient-friendly, not just in SMA, but pretty much for all of the intrathecal products that we're developing. I think that one will also be a game changer going forward. Mike, did you want to talk about the inventory dynamics?\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nYeah. Marc, nothing to call out on inventory. We did see some lumpiness in Spinraza revenue throughout 2024 due to some shipment timing and so forth outside of the US. The fourth quarter, the global 2% growth and the 6% in the US, nothing material to call out in terms of inventory or channel dynamics.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nLet's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Paul Matteis with Stifel.\n\nPaul Matteis\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Chris, if you take a step back now, you've got to be at a point, I would think, with Zurzuvae, Skyclarys, lecanemab to some degree, although maybe the variance of outcomes there is a little bit wider. At least for the next couple of years, you probably have a pretty good window into the range of outcomes for these products. Taking a step back, do you feel like you can get back to sustainable revenue growth based on what you have internally and what you have high visibility into? How important is getting a big upside win from the pipeline or buying growth externally via BD? Thanks so much.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nRight. Well, if you add in everything, there's probably about $4.5 billion of revenue in MS left and probably about $3 billion of profit. That's going to be the headwind over the next five to 10 years because actually, some of these products are actually quite sticky with patients because patients do well on these products and tend to stay on them. It's a slower decline. That's the problem we're solving for.\nWhen you look at it, the number one product that has the most potential to offset is clearly Leqembi. There I think we're encouraged by the more recent results. I think we feel pretty confident that these catalysts could offer the potential to see some acceleration of growth. We do believe that there's a tremendous unmet need in Alzheimer's. People forget that this is a fatal disease. When you look at the data that Priya showed, if you could get 76% of patients stabilized on this, this is data that I think we really need to do more of in demonstrating the value proposition of Lecanemab.\nWe have a number of different approaches. We've, I think, had extremely productive discussions with our partner, Eisai, on the commercial approach. There was an awful lot of effort at the start just to explain care pathways, the side effects, and the reimbursement. I think now we can actually focus a lot more on the value proposition and why treating patients. I think there's a huge opportunity in expanding the prescriber base. We have focused on a smaller number just because of the effort involved by the neurologist.\nI think with things like the subcutaneous formulations and the maintenance, we have an opportunity to go broader. There's about 13,000 physicians who are targets. We have a small fraction of those today who are actually prescribing. There's a lot there. Skyclarys will continue to grow, as we said. Zurzuvae is certainly an interesting, I'd call it, two-base hit in baseball terms in the US. Europe will probably be a more limited set of markets that will actually be able to reimburse this product. I think we've got a lot that we can be doing.\nI think the real growth story is when you start to see the pipeline coming through. As the MS portfolio declines and the new products become a bigger part of the equation, then suddenly you add a pipeline product on top of that. The nice thing about Biogen is that $1 billion really moves the needle. We don't need a lot here to really have a meaningful impact on our growth. I think it's a combination of all of the above, Paul. We will see an increasing percentage of our business coming from these new products, and the pipeline can only augment that.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to say thank you to Mike for all your help over time, and welcome to Tim. I have two questions today, if I may. First, maybe for Priya. Priya, in a scenario where Lilly hits TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 in preclinical on the progression endpoint, how does that factor into your thinking around how you could accelerate timelines for AHEAD 3-45, and also your comfort with the endpoint being used there?\nSecondly, Chris, maybe a big picture question. It seems like where the valuation stands today, around $20 billion in market cap relative to the amount paid for Reata, as well as the amount of balance sheet available for an additional deal coming up. I guess market is almost reflecting somewhat of a view that the M&A choices in the last couple of years may not have been what market was expecting, or perhaps the expectations were higher. How do you think about all of that, and what learnings are you taking from that into additional capital deployment? It will be a very significant move if there were to be a $10 billion deal again.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nI can get started. Thanks, Umer. I think overall, we remain excited, as I shared in my prepared remarks about the potential for AHEAD 3-45. Just a reminder is that we completed enrollment last year. It's a four-year therapy. Eisai has recently actually reiterated the outcome expected in 2028. Now, that said, we always retain and we always continue to evaluate optionality for earlier readouts and earlier cuts. We continue to engage with regulators like the FDA very closely on this. All of that is progressing well.\nNow, that's the acceleration piece. I think the important piece here is the way we've designed the trial. It is quite specific for amyloid load. As you know, it's two sister trials, one with a lower amyloid load, that's AHEAD 3, and then 45, which is a higher amyloid load. Now, in the AHEAD 3, we have a biomarker outcome, which is amyloid clearance essentially, but in the 45, where patients have a higher load of amyloid, we are looking at a very important endpoint that's called the PACC5, which is the preclinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite.\nThis comprises elements of memory, the intelligence test, MMSE, and other components. It is supposed to be quite sensitive and specific for preclinical AD. TRAILBLAZER 3 has different outcomes like CDR Global Score and is also doing a time-to-event. I think we'll wait to see more on how that unfolds. I think we feel very confident about the design of this trial and what it can actually tell us about preventing or slowing down onset of Alzheimer's disease. Over to you, Chris.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen",
    "content2": "Yeah. Umer, there's a human factor here. One of the things I have seen over the years is that your interest in doing significant acquisitions is inversely proportional to your level of confidence in what you've already got in your pipeline. If you don't think you have a lot in your pipeline, you're more likely to be interested in spending more externally. Whether that's logical or not, it has tended to be where you are. I have to say, coming into Biogen, we tended to go after the hardest problems to solve where we didn't understand the underlying disease biology, where we didn't really have phase II data that could really predict where we were in phase III.\nAt that point, you say, \"Well, if you don't know what you've got, you're more interested in looking at things.\" I would say where we are now, two years down the road, is I think Priya with her steely eye has really taken a lot of the stuff out of our pipeline that either was never going to make it to market or if it did make it to market, was never going to have much impact.\nWhat we do have, and we've got more data now, gives us a whole lot more confidence. When you got a dapirolizumab now with a phase III, litifilimab has advanced. The HI-Bio acquisition, we see as pretty transformative for our pipeline because that is exactly what we would like to see more of, is data in phase II that really gives you a sense of some level of conviction into phase III, recognizing that there are never any guarantees in R&D.\nI think where we are is we could continue to do more of the HI-Bio-type transactions. We actually like the Reata transaction. Maybe the street had a different view, but I don't think the street really completely understands how some of these rare diseases really work. For us, over time, we believe that Skyclarys is going to be a significant product. I think it is already a significant product. If we found another Reata where you've got a product that is about to be launched on the market and you could buy it for a price that generates a return for our shareholders, then we would do it.\nI think part of the problem is I don't think the people who are selling companies have quite integrated a lot of the pressures that are on this industry. The IRA is a de facto reduction in patent life for our industry. There's a lot of pricing pressure from around the world. The total commercial return for any one molecule today is not what it was even five years ago. Yet, I don't see really any shift in the premiums being paid or the price being paid. There's always an asymmetry between the products that you know and the products that you're going to buy.\nI think right now, if we could find another Reata, we would probably do it. We don't particularly want to do one deal that takes all of our cash flow because I think there is an interest in building the pipeline with multiple assets. If we could do more HI-Bio, that's probably a nice sweet spot for us. We've concluded that actually we can probably manage quite nicely until the pipeline matures even further. We don't feel any particular pressure to do things.\nI do think it's the job of every leadership person in this business to constantly look outside if we can find other sources of innovation. As I say, I'm actually feeling very good about where Biogen is. Our share price may or may not reflect it, but I'm certainly not alone in this interest in thinking that the share price doesn't reflect where we are. I think that's a function of a lot of the uncertainty around our industry. We are just keeping our heads down and executing on our launches, and making sure these products get to market, and finding if there are shareholder value-enhancing transactions that can be done at pretty much any stage of the value chain.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nLet's go to the next one, please, Jennifer.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Just wanted to come back to the OpEx space. I know the company is wrapping up its Fit for Growth program, and there's some moving pieces here with the Royalty Pharma deal. As we think about the P&L going forward, is this $3.9 billion or so OpEx space a good rough number to think about for Biogen going forward, or is there any other color about how to think about margin progression as we think about the next few years? Thank you.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nYeah. Yeah, Chris, I think that's right. The Fit for Growth program was designed to take our OpEx to a level that supports our revenue expectations. I think that as we exit 2025 and go into future years, obviously, if we have launches to support and other things, we'll need to invest in those appropriately. I think the way that you described it is correct and that the program will be completed at the end of this year, and the $3.9 billion base rate is a good number to use as your baseline model.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah, and clearly, business development, every time you do a deal, you bring in potentially new R&D expense. I think what you've seen us do is prioritize. We have actually stopped a number of internal programs, which actually creates the financial capacity to bring other assets in. One of the biggest problems of business development typically has been is that the R&D budget is full, and there isn't any room to bring in new things. Well, we are actually making some of those difficult choices.\nThe same is true on research. We have dramatically reduced our research budget. The idea was not necessarily to just save cost. The idea was that we wanted a different mix in there. By prioritizing, we can actually do business development without having to increase our overall expenditure, at least. That's what we've been able to do so far.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nI know we're running short on time. Maybe get to squeeze one or two last ones in. Let's go to the next one.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Mike, congrats on your retirement. You will be missed. Robin, I'm really looking forward to working with you. Tim, congrats on your first Biogen earnings call. I got that all in. I want to touch very briefly on the use of GLP-1s in Alzheimer's disease. Novo Nordisk has talked a lot about the evoke trial, high risk, high reward. What happens if that hits and this could evolve the standard of care for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease? Priya, would love your thoughts there. Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes. Thank you, Evan. It's a very interesting hypothesis. It's supported by some preclinical data as well as meta-analysis that was looking at all-cause dementia and then some subsets which also had Alzheimer's disease. Really, the scientific hypothesis behind it is thinking through about how glucose metabolism or regulation of that can impact neuroinflammation, vascular health, all of that, and contribute to more brain health situation. I think that that is worthy of exploring.\nI think we need to remember that some randomized controlled trials have failed in the space. Takeda with pioglitazone and then actually Novo with liraglutide, small trials, 72 subjects, the ELAD trial. They didn't meet their primary endpoints. That said, I think we look forward to seeing the outcomes.\nWhat I think is really important to continue to remember is that when you're tackling something like Alzheimer's disease, you need to tackle the central pathology. We also know that the central pathology is not an overnight buildup but builds up over years. For that reason, we continue to believe that an anti-amyloid agent like Leqembi that really addresses plaque but continues to address soluble toxic species after plaque clearance will have an important role to play. I think we're looking forward to the results of evoke and evoke+ just like everybody. I think we continue to believe that Leqembi is going to play and continue to play an important role.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Let's go to our last one, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen.\n\nPhil Nadeau\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGood morning. Thanks for fitting us in. Let me add our congratulations to Mike, Robin, and Tim on their transitions. Just to drill down on Leqembi's short-term trajectory a little bit more closely. In Q4, revenue was up 30%, but the revenue recognized was only up $1 million. Can you talk about the dynamics behind that? Were there one-time issues, or is there an increase in spend that we should project into 2025? Looking at 2025 trends, growth in 2024 was not entirely driven, but largely driven by ex-US. Is that replicable in 2025, or are the low-hanging fruit of those markets already picked? Thanks.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nWell, I think Leqembi in the US was certainly up 200% Q4 on Q1. We are seeing significant growth in the US. Yes, the ex-US has certainly been strong as well. I think it's both. I think for 2025, in the absence of anything else, we see pretty much continuing trends would be our best guess at this. There may be some acceleration with the IV maintenance, but we're not going to get the subcutaneous for maintenance until really in the last part of the year. The blood-based diagnostics could play a role, but we all know that it takes a while to get diagnostics to be actually accepted and reimbursed. I think we're going to just see good steady progress quarter-on-quarter.\nThere hasn't been that much impact yet on donanemab. That could have a role at some point, but I think they're dealing with the same issues that we are. I think the big thing is really to, as I say, to expand the prescriber base. I think really focus on the benefit of treatment and roll out these new formulations. I think it's going to be continued progress. We obviously continue to believe that Alzheimer's can be a significant market, and that's why we're investing not only in tau, but in other modalities.\nThe unmet need is incredible. 500,000 new patients every year. It's one of the leading causes of death, certainly among over 65-year-olds, but it's even a top 10 cause of death just in the general population. Not to mention the devastation that this causes to families. The unmet need is huge. It is clear that in the short term, we have a lot of capacity constraints, but I think we've made a lot of progress in relieving some of those. I think now with these new formulations such as subcu and with the blood-based diagnosis, we have an opportunity to accelerate our growth, I would say, over the next two to three years.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nPhil, on the numbers, just to reiterate something we said in the prepared remarks, the Leqembi fourth quarter in-market revenue was $87 million globally. That's up about 30% sequentially from the third quarter of 2024 in the US. It was, of the $87 million, $50 million in the US, and that's up about 28% sequentially.\n\nTim Power\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Mike. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. The IR team is available if you've got questions later today. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."

Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to Biogen Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release and other documents related to our results, as well as the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on the call, can be found in the Investors section at biogen.com. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; our Head and President of North America, Alisha Alaimo; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; Mike McDonnell, Chief Financial Officer; and we'll be introducing Dr.\nTravis Murdoch from HI-Bio on the call. We'll make some opening comments, and then we'll move to the Q&A session. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chuck. We got a lot to cover this morning, but, you know, first, in addition to our regular team of Priya, Alisha, and Mike, I'd like to welcome a new member to our team, Dr. Travis Murdoch. Travis is a physician who trained as a gastroenterologist and then studied immunology as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. Following a career at McKinsey, Third Rock, and SoftBank, he became the founder and CEO of HI-Bio. I'm pleased to welcome Travis and the HI-Bio team to Biogen. We now have, again, a presence on the West Coast, and the HI-Bio team, working in collaboration with their Biogen colleagues on the East Coast, will drive forward the development of felzartamab. So we're announcing really strong quarterly results this morning, but I would say this is really a quarter that has lasted 18 months.\nI think the results we're presenting really reflect the hard work of team Biogen to transform our company. You know, 18 months ago, we were a company that had been declining for four years in revenue and profit, and we have been working pretty tirelessly for the last 18 months to really turn that around and create a new future for ourselves. You know, at the Q4 earnings in February of 2023, we outlined five priorities. The first one was focus on new launches. The second was to reduce our cost base and align resources with growth opportunities. The third was to focus our investments in R&D on the most promising assets and improve the risk-reward profile. Four was to optimize our existing portfolio, and five was external growth.\nYou know, we've had a few setbacks along the way, but nonetheless, I think the results today really show that Biogen has done what it said it would do, and that, to me, has been always important in business. So if I take each one of those, I think, you know, if we look at our new product launches, all of the launches are either in line or ahead of expectations. I'm particularly happy to see the very strong results for LEQEMBI, not only in the U.S., but there's been a very successful launch in Japan, and the early data from China are also extremely promising, and Alisha will talk more about that.\nYou know, last year, we set out to reduce our cost base, and we are more than on track on delivering on those results, and you can see that in not only the reduction in OpEx, but the very strong improvement in margins. And Mike will talk about that. But, you know, one of the things that you don't see in the P&L that I'm particularly proud of is, although we've really reduced our cost base and improved our margins, we have invested massively where we need to for growth opportunities, both in LEQEMBI and the other launches, but also on really trying to turbocharge some of the key assets in R&D. And, you know, Priya will talk more about that, but, you know, one of the beneficiaries of that is BIIB080, and another one is litifilimab.\nYou know, we also have, though, although we have seen a declining MS portfolio due to, you know, increased competition, particularly from biosimilars and from generics, we still had a number of products where we still had long patent protection. And one was SPINRAZA, and, you know, I think we've seen some very good performance. This is a very competitive space, and SPINRAZA has been able to hold its own. I think when I first joined the company, most people were predicting the decline of that. Today, I would say, you know, the bumpiness tends to be in some countries where, you know, we only ship every now and then. I think in Russia, for example, we do one shipment per year, so that business has always been a little bit bumpy. But if you look at market share, I think SPINRAZA has done extremely well.\nI'm very pleased to see VUMERITY growing at double digits again now in the U.S.. This is the only patent-protected product in the oral segment of MS. And, you know, we see an awful lot of movement in the injectable part, but the oral segment has stayed pretty much constant, and it's a great opportunity, and I'm glad to see Alisha and her team really taking advantage of that. And then, you know, we always said we were going to be open to external growth, and I think the Reata transaction last year is really starting to pay dividends. We're seeing a very strong launch not only in the U.S., but now also in Europe. As you know, we tend to get patients on access programs, and then the reimbursement follows.\nBut we are expecting to be approved in 20 countries by the end of this year, and I think we're extremely happy with that. ZURZUVAE addresses a huge unmet need, and that launch is also well in excess of expectations. So as I sit here today, I would say, you know, the results that you're seeing are not, as I say, just the results of what we've done in the second quarter, but really, I think we're putting up scores on the scoreboard here that really now are starting to demonstrate all of those initiatives that we put in place last year, and we're starting to deliver on them. Now, of course, we're not done yet, and I think there's a real opportunity to continue to develop a sustainable growth platform, and we'll do that in two ways.\nThe first is really now that we have prioritized R&D, I see the Alzheimer's portfolio as being a core franchise for us for the coming years. We're obviously continuing to invest heavily in LEQEMBI with the maintenance indication, the subcutaneous, but also I think the AHEAD study, if we can really get the evidence that it will really demonstrate the importance of early treatment. Priya will talk about it, but, you know, the 36-month data that we showed at AAIC this week are extremely important for the future growth of LEQEMBI. But, you know, we've always known there'll be other modalities, and I think Tau is emerging as an extremely important modality for the treatment of Alzheimer's, and I think Biogen is a clear leader in that, and again, Priya will say more about that. We're also seeing an emerging lupus portfolio.\nWe'll have a readout later this year with dapirolizumab that we share with UCB, but we're quite excited about litifilimab, both for SLE as well as cutaneous lupus. You know, we add another element to the lupus portfolio with felzartamab, because that is actually in phase I for lupus nephritis. You know, to me, you know, Travis will go into this more, but the acquisition of HI-Bio is extremely important for our longer-term growth outlook. You know, this is an opportunity to present a set of opportunities that have a different risk-benefit profile. You know, we have very strong phase II results, which gives us a whole lot more confidence in phase III results than some of the other assets that we have in our portfolio. Neuroscience is in an area of very important unmet need, but it's also one of the riskiest and hardest areas.\nI think we get a little bit more balance in our portfolio by pursuing things in immunology. So I personally am extremely excited about felzartamab and what Travis and his team can do. The other axis to this is, you know, we're going to continue to look at business development. I think you have seen that we're pretty disciplined. I think both of the acquisitions that we've done so far with Reata and HI-Bio will drive an awful lot of shareholder value, and that is certainly top of mind as we look at business development. So I think Biogen is in a much different place than we were 18 months ago. We still have a number of challenges like any other company, but I think we're really positioned for longer-term growth now at the company.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn it over to Alisha to give us a little more color on the successful launches.\n\nAlisha Alaimo\n\nPresident and Head of North America, Biogen\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. Today, I'll provide our perspective on the progress with LEQEMBI, SKYCLARYS, and ZURZUVAE. I will begin with the Alzheimer's market. We believe we're continuing to build momentum with more health systems across the country now having the capability to treat a higher volume of Alzheimer's patients. In Q2, we saw these promising trends continue. Notably, we sustained new patient growth. Nearly 40% of all commercial patients on therapy since launch started treatment during Q2. The number of physicians prescribing LEQEMBI also grew by 50%. Depth of ordering at our priority 100 IDNs continued to accelerate, and the total order volume more than doubled again in Q2 compared to Q1.\nIt's important to know that based on the data we've seen to date, these trends continued into the first weeks of July, demonstrating that we are sustaining launch progress. We also believe we're seeing positive signals that health system capacity may be increasing. For example, last quarter, I described how some IDNs are expanding and extending their sites of care. Through Q2, nearly 70% of the activated priority 100 IDNs expanded beyond their flagship sites to treat patients at their child sites. We have seen this dynamic play out beyond the priority IDNs as well. We believe this growing real-world experience with LEQEMBI's efficacy and safety further strengthens its unique profile in a newly competitive market.\nSpecifically, some HCPs share that because LEQEMBI was studied in the broadest and most diverse population of any anti-amyloid drug to date, it removes some of the complex considerations about which potential patients are appropriate for Alzheimer's treatments. Alzheimer's is a chronic, degenerative, and fatal disease that does not stop even after plaque is removed. In fact, our long-term data show that patients who stopped LEQEMBI treatment experienced rapid reaccumulation of key plasma biomarkers that indicate Alzheimer's disease biology was returning. Importantly, the rate of decline in most patients who stopped therapy reverted to the rate of decline observed in patients who took placebo, which is why we believe patients deserve a therapy with a benefit-risk profile that enables them to remain on treatment to stay ahead of disease progression even after removing plaques by preventing ongoing damage and plaque buildup.\nRecent data that Priya will describe reinforces that in patients with three years of continuous treatment, LEQEMBI showed continued benefits. And finally, though there are no head-to-head studies comparing the available therapies, the FDA has been clear that the incidence and timing of ARIA vary among drugs in this class. Observed ARIA rates in patients who receive LEQEMBI were the lowest reported among any phase III trial for a drug with traditional FDA approval in the class, with LEQEMBI rates nearly 50% lower. To reinforce LEQEMBI's unique profile with our customers, Biogen deployed our expanded field force just last month. This team increases our focus and frequency, engaging with high-value sites, and expands our reach to 30% more HCPs. We've been receiving positive feedback since the launch of this team.\nBiogen's field force is working even more closely with our partner Eisai, and we believe this is deepening our customer insights, and we will enable accelerated growth. We're encouraged by two strong quarters of growth and the sustained progress in July, and we look forward to providing more support to the healthcare community and people living with Alzheimer's disease. Now, moving on to the SKYCLARYS update, where we continue our strong launch momentum, reaching more Friedreich's ataxia patients globally. In the second quarter, we delivered $100 million in revenue globally and remain ahead of our internal expectations. Europe launch is ahead of internal forecasts, and, along with the rest of the world, builds on the success in the U.S.. SKYCLARYS is now available in 12 markets outside the U.S., including the EU, where we are initiating new patients in the catch-up population.\nThese patients and their HCPs are highly engaged in their care and often awaiting SKYCLARYS approval, as is typical for rare disease launches. In the U.S., we have moved beyond the catch-up population as SKYCLARYS has been in market for more than a year. The team continues to leverage our strong rare disease capabilities, and we are encouraged by the early results of engaging patients and physicians in this next phase. In Q2, roughly 1/3 of new patient start forms came from new writers tied to our AI program, which analyzes hundreds of thousands of de-identified patient journeys. This includes a meaningful share from community neurologists and PCPs. Globally, our outlook in FA is promising in both the short and long term.\nWe anticipate driving strong growth by making SKYCLARYS available in additional geographies, potential expansion into pediatric populations, and with our years of experience identifying patients, we believe we can help. Turning to ZURZUVAE, we continue to outperform our expectations in the first six months of launch. We saw strong growth in the second quarter, with U.S. revenue growing 19% and patient demand nearly doubling versus Q1. OB-GYNs continue to lead prescribing, and patients are sharing positive early experiences with their physicians and on social media platforms. Based on our recent market research, we believe we've achieved higher-than-average aided awareness of ZURZUVAE among providers, outperforming messaging recall analogs in the women's health and psychiatry markets.\nTo achieve the next phase of growth and advance our vision to transform the care of postpartum depression, we are working to more deeply understand how to realize the patient opportunity in this market and drive real behavior change. In conclusion, while each launch is unique, we are pleased that we remain on track or ahead of our expectations across all three therapies. We know we have more work to do to help people living with Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia, and postpartum depression, and we are working with urgency to help these patient communities. I will now pass to Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you, Alisha. Over the last year, we have focused heavily on reviewing our existing pipeline with an eye toward improving its risk profile. The focus now is on building the pipeline through a combination of both internal and external opportunities, with an eye towards risk diversification and creating value. We also remain focused on investing to win in Alzheimer's disease, where we believe we have a differentiated product in LEQEMBI, as well as an industry-leading R&D pipeline of potential next-generation therapies. Beginning with LEQEMBI, LEQEMBI is the only approved anti-amyloid antibody with, first, a dual mechanism of action targeting both amyloid plaques and highly toxic protofibrils. Second, clinical data across the full early Alzheimer's disease population, including individuals with no and low Tau. And third, extensive real-world evidence.\nImportantly, as Alisha mentioned, Alzheimer's disease is a chronic progressive disease, and we believe the dual action of LEQEMBI and the option for continued treatment is a unique advantage for patients looking to maintain or further clinical benefit. To this point, at AAIC earlier this week, Esai presented three-year data from the phase III Clarity study and its open-label extension, which shows continued clinical benefit with longer-duration LEQEMBI treatment. Shown on the left, this includes data from the early start group or individuals who started LEQEMBI during the 18-month placebo-controlled portion of the study, delayed start group, or patients from the placebo arm who switched over to LEQEMBI at the start of the open-label extension, as well as a baseline matched natural history cohort from ADNI.\nThe early start group shows that three years of continuous LEQEMBI treatment reduced clinical decline by -0.95 on CDR-Sum of Boxes as compared to the natural history cohort, resulting in a clinically meaningful benefit for early AD patients. This represents an expansion of the benefit observed at 18 months. It is very important to keep in mind that a change from 0.5 to 1 on the CDR score domains of memory, community affairs, home, and hobbies is the difference between slight impairment and loss of independence. We believe these results are significant as the majority of individuals, approximately 70%, had already successfully cleared plaque by the 18-month time point.\nFurthermore, data from the lecanemab phase II study shown on the right, which included a treatment gap of approximately two years on average, shows that Alzheimer's disease continues to progress when treatment is stopped or interrupted even after plaques are removed. Also at AAIC, Eisai presented data which showed that 51% of patients in the Clarity AD study with either no or low Tau representing an early stage of Alzheimer's showed improvement from baseline in cognition and function over a three-year period as assessed by CDR-Sum of Boxes. Taken together, these data suggest that earlier initiation of treatment with lecanemab may have a significant positive impact on disease progression and may provide continued benefits to patients with early Alzheimer's disease over the long term.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on LEQEMBI with a goal of characterizing dosing for its long-term benefit, providing optionality with subcutaneous formulation, as well as evaluating its role in preclinical AD population, as Chris mentioned. Lastly, while we were disappointed to learn that lecanemab received a negative opinion from the CHMP, we believe that the clinical data supports a clear favorable benefit-risk profile with a meaningful clinical benefit to patients. Furthermore, thousands of patients have now been treated with lecanemab globally, providing further real-world evidence on the efficacy and manageable safety profile. We are continuing to work with Esai as they plan to request a re-examination of the EU filing as we work to enable access for people suffering from Alzheimer's globally. We continue to also invest in our broader Alzheimer's pipeline, including our investigational anti-Tau ASO BIIB080.\nBased on the encouraging data from the phase I-B study, we have now implemented a protocol amendment for the ongoing phase II CELIA study with the aim of accelerating a potential proof of concept outcome. We are excited that this amendment, combined with the robust enrollment trends observed to date, may enable a readout in 2026. Beyond amyloid and Tau, and under Jane's guidance and research, we are advancing a preclinical AD pipeline that encompasses diverse targets and modalities, including active transport approaches. As communicated today in our earnings release, we decided to exit the ATV:A? collaboration with Denali. We continue to see merit in modalities that can actively transport therapeutic agents into the brain, and we continue to prioritize these efforts as we work to build upon our existing leadership in AD.\nLooking back over the last few months, while we discontinued three mid-stage programs based on readouts, we continue to make progress across several other areas of our pipeline. The first patient has received a dose of SKYCLARYS in Biogen's phase I dose-finding study for pediatric Friedreich's ataxia. This is the first step in potentially expanding SKYCLARYS access to the pediatric population, and once a dose is identified, we plan to conduct a phase III study to assess the benefit-risk in pediatric patients. We also expect the DEVOTE study evaluating high-dose SPINRAZA to readout in this second half of the year. We have also made meaningful progress in immunology, where the first patient was dosed in the litifilimab phase III portion of the operationally seamless phase 2/3 AMETHYST study in CLE following the completion of the phase II enrollment.\nAs Chris mentioned, we continue to view immunology as a significant potential driver of Biogen's future growth, and the recent acquisition of HI-Bio is an example of this importance. With that, I would like to hand over the call to Travis, who will dive a bit deeper into felzartamab.\n\nTravis Murdoch\n\nFounder and CEO, HIBio\n\nThank you, Priya. I'm very excited to be here speaking today as part of the Biogen team. I believe we have a unique opportunity to combine HI-Bio's expertise in immune-mediated indications with Biogen's global development and commercial experience in specialized immunology and rare diseases. I believe this synergy will have significant benefit as we work to accelerate our lead asset, felzartamab, or Felda, into late-stage development. As the anti-CD38 antibody, we believe felzartamab has a differentiated molecular design that specifically targets and depletes plasma cells responsible for producing pathogenic antibodies, while sparing the broader B cell lineage. This is different from other programs currently in development for antibody-mediated diseases that more broadly impact B cells. Compared to other mechanisms, we believe the specificity of Felda's MOA may allow for a differentiated and more desirable clinical profile characterized by more durable efficacy and an improved safety profile.\nAs Chris mentioned, one of Biogen's goals is to optimize the risk-reward of the pipeline, and I believe the acquisition of felzartamab significantly advances that effort. Through its cell depletion approach, felzartamab has already demonstrated clinical proof of concept across multiple rare immunology indications. Antibody-mediated rejection, AMR, IgA nephropathy, IgAN, and primary membranous nephropathy, or PMN, are serious conditions that lead to severe consequences for patients, such as transplant failure or end-stage kidney disease, and available treatment options leave significant unmet need. And so we see significant potential commercial opportunity here. Now, I'd like to briefly review the felzartamab data generated to date across these indications to highlight the potential value we see for patients. AMR is the leading cause of kidney transplant loss in the U.S., with no approved treatments, and prior investigational agents have not demonstrated significant resolution of AMR on biopsy.\nThe consequences here can be dire, ending with graft failure, dialysis, and a need for retransplantation in many cases. In the phase II study, which we published in the New England Journal of Medicine, nine doses of Felda IV administered over a five-month period resulted in greater than 80% AMR resolution at week 24 versus 20% for the placebo group. Furthermore, 2/3 of responders maintained AMR resolution out to 52 weeks. So we believe these results, if replicated in a registrational study, are potentially transformative for this disease. Next, I'd like to discuss IgA nephropathy, or IgAN, which is the most prevalent chronic glomerular disease worldwide, and another indication where we believe Felda has the potential to deliver a treatment option for patients with important differentiation.\nFelzartamab directly depletes CD38-positive plasma cells, the producers of both galactose-deficient IgA1 and its autoantibody, which are believed to be the most upstream causes of IgAN. As shown here on the slide, felzartamab treatment resulted in durable reductions in IgA up to 24 months, which is more than 18 months after the last dose. Importantly, this pharmacodynamic effect was selective for IgA, with IgG and IgM levels rebounding to baseline after the completion of the five-month felzartamab treatment. These results, paired with the emerging clinical efficacy data, suggest that felzartamab could have a durable selective effect on IgA and thus impact IgAN disease biology while potentially allowing for the maintenance of general protective immunity conferred by IgG and IgM antibodies over a prolonged period off therapy.\nSimilar to the effects we saw in IgAN, interim results from the phase II IGNAZ study showed a durable reduction in proteinuria as measured by UPCR. Specifically, we saw there was a dose-dependent reduction in UPCR, durable out to the 24-month time point. Now, in terms of potential differentiation, it's important to note that this improvement is after more than 18 months of being off therapy, supporting the potential for felzartamab to be the first non-chronic treatment option in IgAN. Furthermore, in line with the selective targeting of plasma cells, administration of felzartamab was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with prior studies. We believe these interim results potentially provide for a wide therapeutic window and may ultimately lower the risk of chronic immunosuppression, which could be a significant benefit for IgAN patients. Moving to PMN.\nThis is a severe antibody-mediated disease of the kidney that's a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome, which is a severe syndrome resulting from excretion of too much protein in the urine and which causes symptoms such as swelling, fatigue, and increased risk of infection. Current standard of care, which includes immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents, has proven insufficient as up to 40% of patients do not achieve remission and many progress to end-stage kidney disease. It's estimated that up to 80% of patients with PMN have autoantibodies against PLA2R, which is a kidney antigen, and which provides us with a key biomarker both for patient stratification as well as treatment response.\nIn the phase II M-PLACE study, which evaluated felzartamab in both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, as well as patients refractory to immunosuppressive therapies, a 24-week felzartamab treatment resulted in rapid, deep, and durable reduction in anti-PLA2R antibodies in both patient cohorts at the one-year time point. Many patients retained immunologic complete response more than six months after the last dose of felzartamab, which highlights the durability of felzartamab's treatment effect. Importantly, the effect on anti-PLA2R was mirrored when examining reductions in proteinuria. In line with prior studies of felzartamab, PEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity. Based on these results, we believe that felzartamab has the potential to provide a meaningful new treatment for patients suffering with PMN. In summary, we believe the data generated to date highlight the potential for felzartamab to be a best-in-class treatment option across multiple serious immunologic diseases with significant unmet need.\nPhase II data across AMR, IgAN, and PMN have provided proof of concept and highlighted a potentially differentiated clinical profile on the basis of efficacy, treatment durability, and safety. I'm looking forward now to combining the strengths of the joint HI-Bio and Biogen team as we work to incorporate these learnings and further refine our phase III plan. Now, we expect to initiate phase III studies across AMR, IgAN, and PMN next year, beginning with AMR in the first half of the year. I'd now like to pass the call over to Mike for a financial update.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Travis, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the entire Biogen team for a strong second quarter. I'm pleased to provide some color on the results, and please note that all the comparisons that I will make are versus the second quarter of 2023. Total revenue of $2.5 billion was up marginally versus the prior year at actual currency and grew 1% at constant currency. But importantly, we grew our core pharmaceutical revenue 5% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency. This was driven by the performance of our four recent launches, which more than offset the revenue decline in our MS business. Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 31% to $5.28 and included a one-time benefit of $0.52 from the sale of one of our two priority review vouchers. Absent the PRV sale, non-GAAP EPS would have grown 18% to $4.76.\nWe also reported a 43% improvement in Non-GAAP operating income, which was a 30% improvement excluding the PRV sale. We continue to benefit from our R&D prioritization and fit-for-growth initiatives, where I'll provide more detail in a moment. We are pleased to be raising our full-year 2024 guidance range, and in just a few moments, I will also provide some additional details on our guidance. Now, a bit more color on our revenue for second quarter. Our MS franchise revenue declined approximately 5% in the quarter, and there are a few dynamics in this business that are worth highlighting. First, we continue to see erosion of our interferon business as the entire class is seeing a shift to higher efficacy or oral therapies. Regarding TECFIDERA in the EU, we have now seen most generics exit the market, which helped drive ex-U.S..\nGrowth of 11% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency to $208 million this quarter. We continue to believe that we are entitled to market protection in the EU until February of 2025. VUMERITY had its best quarter since launch as global revenue grew 13% at actual and constant currency to $166 million. VUMERITY remains the number one branded oral in terms of share in the United States. U.S. TYSABRI revenue of $249 million declined 4% and benefited from the timing of shipments in the quarter, which was offset by declines due to competition within the high-efficacy class. Next, our rare disease franchise produced revenue of $534 million, and that represented growth of 22% at actual currency and 25% at constant currency. SKYCLARYS global revenue was $100 million. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $429 million declined 2% at actual currency and was flat at constant currency. U.S.\nRevenue was up 1% to $157 million, and we remain encouraged by the resilience here. On LEQEMBI, we saw significant sequential growth with second quarter global in-market sales booked by Eisai of approximately $40 million, which included $30 million of U.S. in-market sales. I'll turn now to a few comments on expenses. We continue to see lower non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, which was driven by a more favorable product mix, notably growth in SKYCLARYS replacing lower margin contract manufacturing revenue. We also had no idle capacity charges during the quarter versus $34 million in the second quarter of 2023. As mentioned previously, our R&D prioritization and fit-for-growth programs have begun to significantly improve our profitability.\nSecond quarter, non-GAAP R&D expense decreased from the second quarter of 2023 by $120 million, or 21%, as we continue to focus our spend on programs with the highest probability of success. Non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 1% in the second quarter. We have significantly reduced selling costs for legacy products and also significantly reduced our general and administrative cost base, which has allowed us to absorb most of the approximately $100 million of Q2 2024 incremental launch costs for LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS. Now, a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, we utilized $1.15 billion of this balance in July when we closed the HI-Bio acquisition. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion of net debt.\nDuring the quarter, we fully repaid the remaining balance of the $1 billion term loan that we put in place at the time of the Reata acquisition. We continued to generate strong cash flow in the second quarter with approximately $592 million of free cash flow, which brings us to approximately $1.1 billion of free cash flow in first half of 2024. We continue to believe that our balance sheet has the capacity for us to invest in both internal and external growth opportunities. Turning now to guidance, we're pleased that the operating performance of the business year-to-date supports raising our full-year 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from a previous range of $15-$16 to a new range of between $15.75-$16.25. This new range reflects expected growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range compared to the full year of 2023.\nI would like to highlight several important things to remember for the second half of 2024 as you update your models. In terms of revenue, with our key products all performing generally in line or slightly ahead of expectations, there is a slight increase to the previous expectations for the year. We now expect full-year total revenue to decline by a low single-digit percentage when compared to 2023. We also expect core pharmaceutical revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year as recent launches are expected to progress and provide an offset to some key potential dynamics in the second half of the year. These include expected continued pressure on our MS franchise, which incorporates the potential for a biosimilar entrant in the U.S. for TYSABRI. We continue to monitor the timing of shipments for SPINRAZA in certain ex-U.S. markets.\nNext, the sale of one of our two priority review vouchers is a non-recurring item, and since we expect to reinvest the proceeds of this sale in growth initiatives later this year, we do not expect this benefit to impact our full-year EPS. Also, some key points to consider regarding our operating expenses. In the second half of the year, we expect to continue to ramp launch spending on our new product launches. This will include the 30% increase in the LEQEMBI field force, which is coming online, as well as additional spend for some targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns. In addition, we expect incremental OpEx primarily on the R&D line of approximately $50 million in the back half of the year related to HI-Bio as we execute plans on three potential phase III starts. We continue to expect full-year 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense of approximately $4.3 billion.\nWe reported approximately $2 billion of spend in the first half of the year, implying higher spend in the second half of the year due to the reasons I just mentioned, along with some typical phasing of expenses throughout the year. I would also note that we now expect 2024 operating income to grow at a mid- to high-teens percentage versus the previous guide of a low double-digit percent growth. This improvement factors in higher expenses in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, partially offset by higher revenue due to our new product launches. I would remind you that we expect a reduction in interest income of approximately $20 million for the remainder of 2024, and this is due to lower cash balances and associated lower interest income resulting from the HI-Bio acquisition.\nAs always, our guidance does not consider the impact from any potential acquisitions, or large business development transactions, or pending and future litigations, as these are often difficult to predict. I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions. Just before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update regarding the strategic review of our biosimilars business. After a comprehensive review of potential externalization options compared to retaining the business, we believe that the best value for shareholders going forward is to retain the business within our portfolio and to optimize the business with an aim to maximize profitability. And with that, we will open up the call for questions.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, can you please poll for questions?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you require any further follow-up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nBiotechnology Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Congratulations on the quarter. At a high level, there's been significant focus on 2024 as a turning point for the company, both product-wise for the launches and operationally, given the cost savings programs and pipeline prioritization. Just given the raised guidance here of 9% year-over-year EPS growth for this year, can you just speak to your confidence around 2023 being the trough year for earnings? And what needs to play out from here for clean growth through the end of the decade? Thank you.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nYeah, thank you for the question, Salveen. Our mission at Biogen remains to bring ourselves to sustainable growth on both the top line and the bottom line. Obviously, our original guidance, which implied growth of 5% on the bottom line at the midpoint and now 9% at the midpoint, shows that we've now turned the corner on the bottom line, and we're very focused on our cost savings program, which importantly not only improves our operating performance, but also frees up capital for growth initiatives. So that's real important. Obviously, we don't guide beyond 2024, but I would say that when you look at our guidance this year, we're pleased with the fact that we've been able to get our top line somewhat much more stabilized, and we've got the bottom line growing again as we look to next year. We're pleased with the progress of the launches.\nOur ability to restore the top line is going to be somewhat dependent on how those launches continue to perform, along with how the MS franchise continues to sustain and be durable. What I can say is that we're very focused on bringing the company back to growth, and we're certainly hopeful that 2023 was the trough year. Obviously, we're doing a nice job growing the bottom line in 2024, and we'll have more to say about the out years as we move to the latter part of this year and into early next.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Mike. Can we take our next question, please, Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. The next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nSadia Rahman\n\nVP of Biopharma Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, this is Sadia on for Mohit. Thanks for taking our questions. I had a question on the EMA decision on LEQEMBI. Do you plan to submit additional evidence on efficacy or safety from trials or from real-world evidence to reverse this decision? And what's your confidence that the decision can be reversed? And what should we think about for a timeline for the EMA to reconsider? And would a SAG need to be convened for this process? Thanks.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you. This is Priya Singhal. We are very disappointed, along with Eisai, at the outcome of the negative opinion for LEQEMBI. We continue to believe that the benefit risk is positive and favorable. As you know, it's been approved in major regions of the world, like the United States, China, Japan, and recently, we've also communicated approvals in Hong Kong, Israel, and South Korea. So yes, we have communicated publicly, and I can reaffirm that we will be applying for a re-examination process. The way the re-examination process works is that you can continue to work with a newly appointed rapporteur and co-rapporteur for the process. So right now, we would wait to receive the assessment report from the CHMP. The new rapporteur and co-rapporteur would be appointed, and then we would work with them to understand what are the issues that are driving the decision.\nCurrently, based on the opinion that was rendered, we believe these are addressable with the data that we've generated. Specifically, we have generated long-term data, as we shared at AAIC, and we would look to be engaging with the EMA and CHMP to see how we can submit additional data and the extensive real-world data that we have in the real world, because thousands of patients now have been treated, so we have long-term continued benefit, as we showed in the three-year data at AAIC, and also long-term safety. So we're continuing to work very closely with ASI on the re-examination process and strategy. It is possible that a new SAG and CHMP would be appointed, and this process would generally move faster than the original application.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thanks for the details, Priya. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. That'll be from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman (BMO Cap\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, and Senior Biotechnology and Biopharmaceutical Analy\n\nHi there. It's Evan Seigerman. Question for Priya. Can you walk me through some of the rationale on opting out of the Angelman syndrome program with Ionis? How has your approach to evaluating partnerships evolved recently, and what aspects of a program do you now more closely scrutinize when you're thinking about what to do with a partner?\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you. I think just stepping back, I want to point us to comments we've made externally before as well, that we have really looked at our readouts as important inflection points, which allow us to double down, accelerate in those programs if the data are objectively clear and compelling. And then the other option would be that we can pivot and pivot to other programs that we may be considering. So overall, our process is that we develop our a priori go/no-go criteria, and based on that, we decide what the probability of technical and regulatory success is in a particular program. And that is exactly the approach that we applied with the Angelman syndrome, the BIIB121 data. That is going to be continuing to be the way that we look at all our readouts, and we try to be very disciplined.\nI think things that we find very compelling are biomarkers, established regulatory pathways, clinical tractability, as well as our confidence in regulatory endpoints or based on interactions with regulators. So we look at all of these, and that's how we think about investment in phase III.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nIf I could just add, I think in addition to what Priya said, we're also looking at the ability to launch products globally. And so we also are interested in the level of evidence and regulatory endpoints as they may be acceptable to payers and regulators around the world and not just in the U.S..\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you both. Next question, please, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. That next question will come from Michael DiFiore with Evercore ISI.\n\nMichael DiFiore\n\nDirector of Biotechnology Pharmaceuticalsa and Major Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if there's any updates on the subcutaneous induction dose optimization work you're doing and whether this could lead to a more optimal risk-benefit ratio that the EMA is looking for.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes. So overall, as Eisai and Biogen have communicated, we continue to—we've already filed for the IV maintenance, and we have a fast track and a rolling submission in place for the subcutaneous maintenance dosing. With the initiation of subcutaneous dosing, we are looking at optimizing the dose. We're continuing to work with FDA on this effort, and currently, we are on track, as we've communicated, to have an outcome on this from the FDA in the U.S. by Q1, calendar year Q1, 2026. Now, with regards to your specific question about how this could impact the application in Europe, I just want to be really clear that the application in Europe that's currently—we're going to pursue re-examination—is dependent on the original application, which is really for intravenous LEQEMBI.\nWe would hope that we can get a favorable outcome at the end of the re-examination process, and if so, we would continue down the path of, again, providing options to patients as well as in Europe with subcutaneous formulation.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you, Priya. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. That'll be from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\n\nNicole Gabreski\n\nVP of Equity Research and Biotechnology, Piper Sandler\n\nOh, thanks. This is Nicole Gabreski on for Chris. Maybe just one on LEQEMBI. So some of our survey work we've done recently with neurologists and Alzheimer's specialists has kind of indicated maybe a less favorable view of the risk-benefit and cost-benefit ratios for LEQEMBI in recent quarters. And I guess we're starting to see some feedback from docs also questioning the amyloid hypothesis as a whole. I guess maybe just given this, could you speak to the interactions and/or feedback that reps are having in the field? I guess are you starting to maybe experience any pushback as you move from HCPs who are sort of ready and waiting to prescribe LEQEMBI soon after approval to those who are in the next wave of uptake?\n\nAlisha Alaimo\n\nPresident and Head of North America, Biogen\n\nThank you for the question. This is Alisha. Whenever we look at market research, I think it's important to understand who you're asking in the market research. And so, when we look at what's happening in the field, at least on the ground, when you're asking the physicians, if you were to parse out market research and ask the physicians who are currently obviously prescribing and the ones who aren't, the ones who are prescribing are the ones that we've been working really hard on over this past year. They're the ones that understand the data. They've been visited by MSLs. They've been visited by representatives. And then it takes them time to obviously get up and running with their facility. You also then see across the board that other physicians see this happening, and some in a nearer location will also start obviously picking up the product.\nSo on the ground and with our representatives, they go from office to office. We're obviously expanding now as well with the additional field force. What we've seen is the ones that you call on are the ones that actually start writing. There's a lot of dynamics at play here. I think that understanding this data is important. I think understanding all the mechanics in order to get a patient diagnosed is important, and having them set up their capacity is important. We don't really hear any pushback about cost-benefit. I can say that. I think more importantly, what we're hearing now is, because we are a year out, we're starting to really get the real-world experience feedback from physicians on the impact this is having on patients, the caregivers, and the families.\nI think that alone has really also accelerated some of these physicians to try and treat patients even more quickly. So for now, we're not really hearing that pushback.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen",
    "content2": "Yeah. And if I could just add to that, after decades of this, I tend to pay more attention to what physicians do versus what they say. And this is a very heavy lift for physicians to introduce this treatment into their practices and institutions. And when you look at the number of the increase of 50% of physicians writing this and the depth of ordering from the IDNs, we're seeing a lot of physicians investing huge amounts of time and energy to actually get through all of the processes, schedule the PET scans, the lumbar punctures, or the MRIs. And to me, you don't do that if you don't have a strong conviction in the importance of this treatment to patients. So personally, as I look at this, I'm extremely encouraged by where we are.\nI think now, for the first time since the launch, that we can look forward to the growth of this market, not just because of the prescriptions, but I look at the evidence base that we are building with our partners at Eisai on LEQEMBI. It's very clear now from the three-year data that it probably is not going to be enough to just remove the plaque. We'll need to continue to treat patients. And again, as I was saying earlier, with the AHEAD Study, we hope to show that there is a benefit to treating earlier. So this market is going to grow, and the evidence base is going to grow. It is market-building that we're doing, and that certainly takes time and patience. But as I say, I've said in the past that it's difficult to predict where we're going to go.\nWith this quarter, I think we're seeing we're on a very solid track. I think the entry of Lilly will only accelerate the development of this marketplace.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you. Let's take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question will come from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.\n\n[Analyst] (RBC Capital Markets)\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi everyone. This is Nevin on for Brian here. Congrats on a good quarter, and thank you in advance for taking our questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the SKYCLARYS dynamic that we're seeing, specifically what you're seeing on patient persistence or potential discontinuation rates there, some of the educational efforts that you're taking to kind of convince the patients to remain on therapy even if they're not seeing the efficacy of the therapy right away. And maybe if you could speak a little bit more to some of the perceptions that patients and doctors may have on the cardiac safety and benefits there as well. Thanks.\n\nAlisha Alaimo\n\nPresident and Head of North America, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you for the question. This is Alisha. First, we are very pleased with what we're seeing right now, especially globally and in the U.S. with SKYCLARYS. As I've mentioned before, we're past the catch-up population, and we're now really into the patient identification phase. We look at every metric from discontinuation, compliance, adherence, start times. When it comes to discontinuations, we do not see anything outside of what you see in the clinical trials. So the discontinuation rate is not anything more than, obviously, what we also saw in trials. I think when it comes to efficacy of the patients, physicians have been really good on setting expectations with patients on what to expect from SKYCLARYS. The field teams do a really good job of also educating both physicians and educational materials with patients on what to expect when you start this product.\nYou do see that patients tend to stay on product. Physicians are very good also about saying to patients, \"At least stay on it for a year, and let's talk about how you're feeling and where we're going and what we're seeing as adherence has been actually very good.\" I think the other dynamic that's playing out that you could be referring to is because we're now in the patient identification phase, you are going to see a little bit of difference from week to week and month to month. We are adding patients every single week. We're also adding them every single month. We acquire new data on a regular basis.\nAnd what we're seeing, at least recently, and I was sharing this with Chris the other day, we have this new AI engine that we've been deploying, and we have identified a significant number of additional coded FA patients that we didn't even have at the beginning of launch because we're starting to see that patients are engaging even more with their physicians. And so now we're able to reach them with more efficiency and with more certainty across the board. And I think it's been very promising as we find new patients to come on.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thanks, Alisha. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. That'll be from Paul Matteis with Stifel.\n\nPaul Matteis\n\nManaging Director and Head of Therapeutics, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. I think over the past year, Biogen's commentary on business development capacity has evolved a couple of times. More recently, I think you said around $10 billion, maybe minus the HI-Bio deal. I guess just kind of going forward in 2024 or the near to midterm, what's Biogen's appetite for bigger transactions or a Reata-like transaction? And what's the updated thinking on specific therapeutic areas or types of assets of interest? Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. I'll take that one. I think first, in terms of where we're looking, I think we're already long neuroscience, so we're probably looking outside of that space: immunology, rare diseases. As I look at Biogen, I would say we have an extremely high scientific and medical capability within the company. We have been historically a company that is in the low-volume, high-value area. We really understand the necessity to assist patients and physicians for some expensive products to get through reimbursement, provide and sponsor genetic testing, for example. Thinking about studies and real-world evidence becomes extremely important in this. So I think there's a capability of Biogen in rare diseases. Immunology is really an area we've been in since we started with multiple sclerosis. So I think we have the capabilities to go into those areas. I think where we are now is we're on a growth pattern.\nIf we could find another Reata-type acquisition, I think we would look for that. But those come along pretty rarely. It's rare that you can find a company that is that close to the market. In fact, it already launched by the time we actually had acquired that, but acquire that for a price that still creates shareholder value. We will continue to look, but they don't come along every day. We're not in a position where I think we are desperate to do a deal. So I think if you look at what we've done with HI-Bio, for example, as an alternative to that, being able to launch more products in the sort of 2027-2030 timeframe is a priority for us. That's why we're really also focused on the mid to late-stage development process. But we can be picky.\nI think also where we look is not necessarily where everybody else is looking. You really don't create value if you enter into these auction processes. And so I think by being able to stick to those areas where we think this is a really, this is a space where Biogen can really be a strong player, we'll avoid overpaying. I think the other thing I would say is Biogen's a nice size. $1 billion moves the needle hugely in our company. There are a lot of bigger companies where $1 billion doesn't move the needle. And so I think we can look at assets where we have the capital that might be too small for some of the bigger players but be too expensive for some smaller players.\nSo I think in some ways, we're in a position where we can look for assets and not necessarily be in such competitive places where, again, you risk overpaying. But we're looking. We take a systematic view. We're not going to take any sudden left turns strategically just because I'm not sure that that's really where the sweet spot is for Biogen. But I do think there's a number of opportunities out there. We also are doing a lot more in research on collaborations. And I think one of the things I'd like to see us do is really bring a lot more assets in from an early stage because the earlier you can acquire these assets, the more shareholder value you can create.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. That'll be from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director in Healthcare Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Thank you. Earlier in the call, you commented about an emerging lupus portfolio, and I know that you do have some upcoming lupus data. We've looked at the prior data. There are reasons to believe that longer treatment and a bigger study could help here. Can you just speak to your expectations? What are you looking for? What needs to happen to move forward? Etc., etc. Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes. Thank you. This is Priya Singhal. So overall, we are excited about the readout for dapirolizumab. It is upcoming in the next several weeks. This is a partnered program with UCB, and the collaboration is in a very good place. We are expecting the headline or top-line results of the first global phase III trial. And specifically, I want to be clear that this study is investigating in this very high unmet disease area the safety and efficacy of dapirolizumab as an add-on to standard SLE therapy versus placebo as an add-on to standard SLE therapy. We are conducting the study in patients who have persistent, active, or frequent flaring despite stable standard of care. And very similar to the phase I and phase II, we will be looking at efficacy assessed by BILAG-based composite lupus assessment or BICLA.\nBut different than the phase II study, it'll take place over the 48 weeks to demonstrate the long-term effect. We also increased the sample size to provide a substantial data set on safety and efficacy. Eventually and ultimately, we'll be looking for a meaningful change on the primary endpoint and key secondaries such as severe flare prevention, and patients achieving low-dose activity. We really think that BICLA is a sensitive, clinically meaningful composite for SLE disease activity that requires disease improvement across all body symptoms with moderate or severe baseline activity without the need for escalation in steroids or other background medications, as well as without worsening. We're looking forward to this. In addition to an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, we think this could be really meaningful for patients suffering from SLE.\nIf the results warrant continuing development, at this point, we expect to have the need to run another phase III, but we are planning some of this at risk right now.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Priya. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. We'll now move to Eric Schmidt with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nEric Schmidt\n\nBiotechnology Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThanks for taking my question. Maybe for Chris, this call today seems to be like a relative high watermark in your tenure as CEO given some of the initiatives that are now well in place and all that you've accomplished. You certainly called that out in your prepared remarks. You also called out that you've got some challenges, and you're not done. So what in particular is top of mind there? Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nWell, thanks for the question. I would hope it's not the high watermark because we're aiming much higher here, I can tell you. Yeah. I think clearly, we've got still an MS franchise that is, we're not done yet in terms of seeing the competitive threats. There's potentially a biosimilar for TYSABRI. We have an important patent litigation that we'll see in the fall for TECFIDERA in Europe. And there is the market exclusivity that expires in February. So shorter term, there's always chop in the water. But I think where we have an opportunity is we have an amazing talent base inside of Biogen. As you all know, I've been in this business a long time, seen a lot of companies. I continue just to be impressed by the scientific and medical capability that we have in the company. And we've got capital.\nAnd so I think we can do smart things with that capital. We've been busy transforming essentially passive capital into active capital. We had two Priority Review Vouchers sitting on the shelf. The innovative nature of Biogen's products is such that we don't really need those vouchers because of the innovative products we're bringing to market anyway. So we had this one Priority Review Voucher sitting on the shelf for six years that we've now converted, hopefully, into an active asset. We sold it, but the objective is to spend that on milestones in business development in the second half. If I look at HI-Bio, we took a year and a half of fit-for-growth savings out of operating expense and transformed that into a growth opportunity with the acquisition of HI-Bio. So where I see us is I think we've been able to change the trajectory of the company.\nWe've been able to release resources from the business and reinvest them intelligently. And we've got great people that I think can do that with tremendous results. So I think as we look towards the future, it's really building out now the R&D portfolio, both internally and externally. I'd like to make sure we are still an innovation company going forward, that we're not just acquiring our future, but really investing in that. So I think I'm now focused on the 2025 to 2030 timeframe. I think we're in good shape to grow through that period, but I think we can do more to really take advantage of the capability in R&D. And I think you'll see us continue to deploy capital with a lot of discipline, but I think be able to turn passive capital into active capital and then into active growth.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Our team will remain available for any additional questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Business Update. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference.\n\nCharles E. Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Jennifer. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone, and welcome to Biogen's first quarter 2024 earnings call.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures, with the reconciliation to the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today, are in the Investors section of biogen.com. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call.\nI'd point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nOn today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; our Head and President of North America, Alisha Alaimo; our CFO, Mike McDonnell; and Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development, is with us and will be available for the Q&A session. Chris, Alisha and Mike will each make some opening comments, and then we'll move to the Q&A session. And to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nWith that out of the way, I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. Well, it is certainly great to be able to announce earnings per share growth in our first quarter. This is the first time in several years that the underlying business performance of Biogen has allowed us to actually demonstrate the earnings per share growth. And that's a major achievement. We've clearly still got a lot of work to do, but I think it feels like we're turning the corner in the company.\nAnd with that, I'd like to actually take the opportunity to thank my Biogen colleagues. We have instituted an awful lot of change within the company. And I'd like to thank them for their commitment, passion and patience throughout this process.\nBut I think you're seeing some of that change that has occurred now in the numbers. We have tried to bring a lot more focus and discipline to really putting our resources behind those things that do good and drive value.\nAnd one of the things that you may not see is that there is an awful lot of reinvestment going on. One of my early bosses in my career once told me, you can't save your way to prosperity in this business. And that is absolutely true. And that's not really what we set out to do.\nThe Fit for Growth project, which is, as you can see from the numbers, on track to achieve its $1 billion in gross savings and $800 million in net cost savings, and by the way, $800 million of increased cash flow as well, by the end of 2025.\nBut what we really tried to do was redesign the organization. We have been so focused as a business for decades on our multiple sclerosis franchise, and here we are launching 4 first-in-class new medicines, and we really needed to make sure we're supporting those launches. And in fact, despite the cost reductions and margin improvements that Mike is going to go into in more detail, but behind that, there are hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in these new launches.\nAnd while our overall expense in research and development has decreased, this focus has actually enabled us to increase the investment in those assets where we have the most conviction. So this is much more than a cost savings exercise. This has been a redesign, and a change in our culture to a degree.\nSo let's look at some of these new launches. And obviously, the one that everybody is most interested in is LEQEMBI, and if we can move to that slide.\nYou can look at this in a number of different layers. Obviously, first, we're seeing really good quarter-on-quarter trends. As you've seen, the number of patients on drug has increased 2.5-fold compared to where we finished the fourth quarter. Our in-market revenue almost tripled in Q1 versus Q4 of last year. And that's obviously important.\nBut the thing that really is important to me, as I look at this, is not so much just that. I've been in this business for 3.5 decades, I've lost count of how many launches I've seen. But this is an extraordinarily difficult launch, really because the amount of change that physicians are facing with this is really profound. And as I go around to hospitals and talk to doctors and talk to those who are seeing other doctors, it really becomes evident that there are an awful lot of challenges to getting that -- even that first patient on treatment.\nWe are at one hospital, it was going to take -- it took them 3 months to get approval just to hire a nurse to help navigate the system. And another major medical center, they were having to develop a 5-year business plan just to be able to access the infusion beds. And when you look at some of the uncertainty around PET scan reimbursement, and although CMS had clarified that, a lot of them actually had pulled it through, there was still a lot of difficulty getting that clarity all the way through the channel.\nAnd what I'm really encouraged by when I look at these numbers is, when -- although there are a lot of challenges, it's a lot of time investment for physicians, and I think a lot of those physicians, to their credit, are investing that time and not necessarily getting reimbursed for that. But they're getting it done. They're overcoming these challenges and barriers.\nAnd that is, I think, what is so important. They see the need when they look at patients who, accomplished people, who are loved by their families, and seeing this dreaded disease pull the patient away from that on a day-by-day basis.\nSo I do think we are seeing an awful lot of momentum here. And again, I think there's an awful lot of credit to the neurologists and to these centers to overcoming these challenges. And I think that is going to allow us to continue to see quarter-on-quarter growth. It may not be completely linear, and Alisha will go into more detail on that. But it takes time to get these protocols in place. And even when you get the first patient, there has been a tendency to let's have a handful of patients so we get comfortable with the system. But then once they've done all that, then we're starting to see volume pull through.\nAnd one of the interesting things about this launch is that, generally, we look at revenue as a surrogate for demand. And here, there's -- that linkage is not quite so clear because it has taken this upfront time before you see revenue pull through. And I think that's one of the other things we're now seeing in this first quarter, is that we're actually seeing a little bit more of that linkage between demand and revenue. And behind all of this, once those processes are in place and once physicians are ready, there is clearly an underlying demand behind that.\nSo I think that has given us a lot of confidence to now invest more. We have a 30% expansion in our U.S. field force plans. But I would also say this is a launch that really didn't start until 1st of September. And even then you could argue we weren't fully in the mode of being able to launch because the PET scan reimbursement hadn't been cleared.\nBut our U.S. teams for both Eisai and Biogen have done an awful lot of work to look at the data from the first 7 months of the launch. And really, we're now looking at redeploying some resources here and there as we see what's important and what's not. I think the teams are really working well together. And we have a number of new elements of our promotional mix that will start to come into play as we progress through the second quarter.\nSo from a Biogen point of view, I think it's too early to put out any forecast. We're going to be looking at those month-over-month new patient starts and the increase in revenue. But I would certainly say, I'm extremely encouraged by the progress that has occurred.\nAnd if I could switch gears to another key growth driver, which is SKYCLARYS, and Alisha again will go into more detail, and I think also just show investors how we're progressing versus other analogs. Because the rare disease market doesn't behave so typically as in other markets. There's always a catch-up population in rare disease. And so it takes a while for that catch-up population to work through the system and then have a look at what's the underlying demand.\nRemember that these are not patients sitting in waiting rooms and that there is a huge amount of work that goes into finding patients. And I think that is actually one of Biogen's strengths. That's I think what gives me the confidence to continue to invest more, because I do think there is a know-how within Biogen. And that's one of the reasons we want to build out a rare disease franchise.\nBut we've got 1,100 patients now on therapy in the U.S. That's a really significant number. But I'm also really encouraged by the launch in Europe. We've already got -- and remember, this drug was only approved in -- at the end of January. And yet we already have 300 patients on treatment. You all know Europe, we have to go country by country to get reimbursement, and we have early access programs. Some of those we can charge revenue for some of them we can't. But we have already submitted reimbursement dossiers in 5 countries in the U.S. So I think Europe will increasingly add to the revenue. It's probably more of a 2025 story than in 2024. But I think if I'm looking at the acceptance and the uptake, then that launch is also off to a successful start.\nAnd we know that there are an awful lot of patients in Latin America, and we've already submitted in Brazil, for example, and submitting in Argentina. And I think that actually is going to be a major benefit and opportunity for us as well. Remember, there are no patients in Asia because this is a genetic disease that really affects people of European descent. And in fact, it was quite interesting, I was talking to a key opinion leader in Germany who has actually done genetic studies. And you basically just follow where the explorers went and that's where you're going to find the patients.\nSo I think with that, let's dive in a little bit deeper, and I'll turn it over to Alisha.\n\nAlisha A. Alaimo\n\nPresident of Biogen U.S. Organization, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning to everyone that's able to join the call today. I'm Alisha Alaimo, and as Chuck shared, I lead our business in North America.\nThis is a really unique period in Biogen's history with multiple first-in-class drug launches in the U.S., which gives us an opportunity to drive our return to growth. And for our team, it's also meaningful to support more people living with Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia and postpartum depression. We thought it might be helpful to provide a perspective on the market dynamics of the launches and share how we're seeking a tailored approach to help provide patients with access to our therapies.\nLet me begin with the Alzheimer's market. As Chris mentioned, we are seeing many major health systems across the country take a deliberate, staged and phased approach, meaning they are setting up their pathways to get patients started with diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. We believe we are now seeing a dynamic where some IDNs are turning the page, and they are focusing on expanding and extending their model.\nIn Q1, we saw several IDNs across regions scale their patient volume. Among our priority 100 IDNs, units more than tripled in quarter 1 compared to quarter 4, which contributed to the overall estimated patients on therapy increasing approximately 2.5x in quarter 1 versus quarter 4.\nWe believe this acceleration in new patients really began to emerge at the end of the quarter. For example, more than 20% of new patients since launch were added in March. Today, among our 100 priority IDNs, more than 80% have approved LEQEMBI through their [ P&T ]process, and nearly 85% of those IDNs with approval have placed an order.\nChris also mentioned that we're seeing more physicians gain experience with LEQEMBI. We saw the number of unique prescribers in quarter 1 double compared to quarter 4. We believe that we're still in the early phases of unlocking the potential to treat a high volume of patients at the priority IDNs. And I thought it might be helpful to share some examples of these dynamics at the site level.\nThere is 1 large health system in the Midwest that added LEQEMBI to its formulary in July of last year. 6 months later, entering Q1, the system had ordered only 300 units. However, by the end of March, they had ordered 2,700 units.\nSimilar to the example I just shared, there is also a health system in the Southeast that added LEQEMBI to its formulary in August of '23. 5 months later, entering Q1, this system ordered about 560 units. By the end of Q1, this system ordered more than 1,750 units to treat their patients. For context, a local neurologist network in that same region ordered 3,000 units through the same time period, perhaps because they've been able to scale their processes to treat more patients. However, we believe this well-known Southeast IDN is planning to move beyond their flagship site of care to treat at multiple locations, which is another example of the expand-and-extend trend at the IDNs.\nWe believe many systems just now appear to be completing the staging phase, and we think the recent trends observed support our continued belief that LEQEMBI represents a significant commercial opportunity over the mid to longer term.\nWith access and infrastructure progressing and patient volume accelerating, we believe this is also the right time to expand the field force. Biogen leaders are working to hire a customer-facing field team, which will join Eisai. Simultaneously to activate the patient community, Biogen and Eisai have launched new direct-to-patient and caregiver omnichannel marketing campaigns. These digital programs and point-of-care resources are focused on the already-diagnosed patients who we believe are under the care of a neurologist. With these promising signals emerging, we look forward to providing more updates in the future.\nNow moving to SKYCLARYS. We believe we're driving strong performance with the launch as we continue to exceed market penetration rates of most rare disease launch analogs. As of April 19, we now have over 1,100 patients on therapy, with an estimated 4,500 addressable Friedreich's ataxia patients in the U.S., we have achieved 24% market penetration, which exceeds our own strong SPINRAZA launch. As is typical with the rare disease launches, we believe we are now moving beyond the catch-up population to reach additional patients who previously received a diagnosis of or are suspected to have Friedreich's ataxia. Though patient numbers may be uneven, we anticipate adding patients each month.\nLast quarter, we shared how we've integrated some of our sophisticated rare disease capabilities to drive improvements in access logistics and patient support. Notably, our market access team continued to make progress with securing favorable policies in quarter 1. Today, nearly 80% of all U.S. pharmacy lives now have SKYCLARYS reimbursement. These patient support and access efforts are critical to help patients start therapy as soon as possible and remain on treatment for the long term.\nWith a meaningful foundation of patients on therapy, we are focusing on 2 key areas in this next phase of our launch. First, educating community neurologists and PCPs about Friedreich's ataxia and SKYCLARYS. And second, engaging additional appropriate patients. I'll begin with our focus on HCPs.\nRemember, with Friedreich's ataxia, in addition to patients being concentrated at the top centers of excellence, we believe they are also being treated in the community. To support these physicians, we have expanded our field footprint and we are using AI to analyze data to help reach the HCPs who may have untreated patients. With insights into the relevant sites of care and when patients last engage with their physicians, we believe we can help more patients even sooner. And with genetic testing, we anticipate patients can confirm a potential diagnosis and determine if SKYCLARYS is a treatment option.\nAs far as our patient activation focus, we are encouraged by real-world experiences that patients are sharing on social media. As in our experience, these stories can help other diagnose patients. Many of these stories about the impact of SKYCLARYS include reports of slowing of disease progression and, in some cases, even an improvement in their symptoms long term. In addition to these organic stories, we anticipate launching our SKYCLARYS social media campaign soon. So we believe we're off to a strong start, but we know there are more people living with Friedreich's ataxia that we can help, and we look forward to supporting them.\nWhich now brings me to ZURZUVAE. As Chris mentioned, we are encouraged by the performance of the launch to date, and we think we are seeing several positive trends with providers, patient experience and reimbursement.\nFirst, let me begin with providers. Across multiple physician types, we believe many providers are demonstrating an urgency to treat. Notably, OB/GYNs led overall prescribing in quarter 1, which we believe is encouraging as they are often the first to see PPD patients. Furthermore, breadth of adoption has continued to grow. In March nearly double the number of HCPs prescribed ZURZUVAE compared to just January. We've seen that some early prescribers require only a few calls before they treat.\nKeep in mind that ZURZUVAE is a scheduled product available through a specialty pharmacy. While we believe psychiatrists are generally familiar with working with specialty pharmacy, this could be a new process for many OB/GYNs. We're working to educate these providers on the steps required so that they can support their appropriate patients.\nSecond, some HCPs have early experience with ZURZUVAE have shared that some of their patients reported significant improvement in depressive symptoms within days of starting treatment. Several patients are sharing their personal 14-day treatment experiences on platforms like TikTok, and we believe their courage to tell their story will help educate other women living with postpartum depression.\nThird, we believe we're making good progress with government and commercial access. Many payers already have policies in place, the majority of which have been favorable, while some others continue to cover ZURZUVAE even without formal policies in place. Two of the 3 national pharmacy benefit managers are providing coverage for ZURZUVAE without overly burdensome restrictions. We are in active discussions with a third national PBM as we await their decision.\nAnd while Medicaid tends to take longer, almost half of the states, including several of the largest, accelerated reviews into quarter 1, which we believe is unusual for a process that can typically take up to a year after FDA approval. We are encouraged that approximately 2/3 of Medicaid lives with published policies appear to have minimal access restrictions. We anticipate the remaining states to review coverage throughout 2024, and we will continue to support their reviews as much as possible.\nBefore handing it over to Mike, I want to underscore that we have an important responsibility to help people living with Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia and postpartum depression, and we are working with urgency to help these patient communities. We believe we're making significant progress in that mission, and we look forward to continuing to share updates with you. With that, I'd like now to pass it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Intelsat SA\n\nThank you, Alisha, and hello to everyone. I'd like to start with a high-level overview of our financial profile and how we are seeing this progress in the context of our Fit for Growth program. We maintain a sharp focus on improving profitability as we endeavor to return the company to not just EPS growth but revenue growth as well. Please note that any financial comparisons that I make are versus the first quarter of 2023.\nRegarding our top line, our 4 recent launches contributed revenue in the first quarter, which more than offset the 4% decline in our MS business. And as we noted during our previous earnings call and our recent webcast investor conference, we expect that this year's revenue will be skewed more towards the second half of the year, and we expect this to be due to both the timing of shipments for SPINRAZA outside the U.S. as well as the expected growth profiles for our recently launched products.\nOn gross margin, we saw improvement of 5 percentage points in the quarter as our revenue mix has shifted. This is due to increasing high-margin product revenue replacing lower-margin contract manufacturing revenue. We also had $45 million of idle capacity charges in the first quarter of 2023, and none in the first quarter of 2024.\nOur R&D prioritization and Fit for Growth initiatives had a clear impact on our non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses, which we refer to as core OpEx, during the quarter, and that resulted in a 13% decrease year-over-year. These savings contributed to meaningful growth of our non-GAAP operating income of 24% year-over-year.\nOur operating margin was 31% in the quarter as compared to 23% in the first quarter of 2023. And while these are encouraging improvements so far, we believe there is still more work that can be done to continue to improve these metrics.\nNow a bit more color on revenue dynamics during the first quarter. Total revenue was $2.3 billion, which was a decrease of 7% at actual and constant currency. Our MS franchise revenue declined approximately 4% driven by competition and the usual channel seasonality that we see in the first quarter. Within MS, VUMERITY revenue grew 18% and benefited from global patient growth as well as some favorable channel dynamics during the first quarter.\nRegarding TECFIDERA in the EU, we have now seen most generics exit the market, which drove ex U.S. growth of 5% for TECFIDERA this quarter. We continue to believe we are entitled to market protection in the EU until February of 2025.\nAnd now a quick double-click on our rare disease revenue for the quarter. SKYCLARYS delivered $78 million of revenue, including approximately $5 million in Europe, where we have launches in several countries underway.\nFor SPINRAZA in the U.S., revenue was up 1% in the quarter, and we remain encouraged by the resilience here. SPINRAZA revenue outside the U.S. declined 35%. The majority of this year-over-year decline was due to shipment timing in certain emerging markets. We continue to generally see stable patient numbers globally, and we would expect the shipping dynamic outside the U.S. to largely normalize throughout the remainder of 2024. We also saw some modest negative impacts from competition and foreign exchange in the quarter. For the full year 2024, we expect global SPINRAZA revenue to decline by a low single-digit percentage.\nZURZUVAE delivered $12 million of revenue, which we believe is inclusive of some channel stocking in anticipation of increasing demand, which is common for any new launch.\nAnd lastly, contract manufacturing revenue was notably lower year-over-year. And as we reflected in our guidance for the full year, we continue to expect contribution from this line to be significantly lower than last year due to completing a number of batch commitments in 2023.\nFirst quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was 22% of total revenue, and that's an improvement of 5 percentage points. As I previously mentioned, this improvement was driven by a more favorable product mix as revenue from new product launches replaced lower margin contract manufacturing revenue. And it also was related to having lower idle capacity charges. We did not have any in the first quarter of 2024.\nFirst quarter non-GAAP R&D expense decreased $124 million, which was driven primarily by savings achieved from Fit for Growth, where we remain on track to achieve cost savings of $1 billion gross and $8 million net of investment by the end of 2025. We also saw savings as a result of our R&D portfolio prioritization, which has had a meaningful impact as we discontinued some programs and have focused our spend on areas we believe have a higher probability of success.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expense decreased approximately $33 million in the first quarter, and this was primarily due to $50 million of G&A-related cost reductions, which were realized in 2024 in connection with our Fit for Growth program. And that was offset by an increase in operational spending on sales and marketing activities in support of the LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS launches. I will also note that the prior year included $31 million related to the termination of a co-promote agreement for our MS products in Japan.\nAll of this together contributed to non-GAAP operating income growing 24%, with non-GAAP operating margin now above 30% and improving, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%.\nNext, a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.5 billion of debt, $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and net debt of roughly $5.5 billion.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the $6.5 billion of total debt included $250 million of the $1 billion 2023 term loan, which was put in place at the time of the Reata acquisition. As of March 31, 2024, we had repaid $750 million of this $1 billion facility. The remaining $250 million is expected to be repaid during the second quarter of this year, so this quarter, earlier than our original expectation which was by the end of this year. I'd note that this cash and marketable securities figure does not include a $437 million payment from Samsung, which we received earlier this month.\nWe continued to generate strong free cash flow during the first quarter with approximately $507 million of free cash flow. So overall, our balance sheet remains in a strong position with increasing capacity to invest in growth initiatives.\nAnd regarding our strategic review of the biosimilars business. At this point, we have not received an acceptable offer from a third party. Our process remains ongoing, and we will remain disciplined as we continue to explore all options, including retaining the business.\nNext, I'd like to discuss our full year 2024 guidance ranges and assumptions. We are reaffirming our expectation of full year 2024 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16, which reflects expected growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range as compared to 2023. All of the previous assumptions to our guidance, including those you see on this slide, remain unchanged.\nI'd like to remind that we have potential R&D success milestone or opt-in payments associated with the upcoming clinical data readouts, and we have made an allowance for some of these potential payments in our guidance. Of course, whether or not they are paid will be dependent on the data and our resulting decisions.\nAnd finally, we just announced the completion of a sale of 1 of our 2 priority review vouchers for $103 million. At this point, we expect to earmark these proceeds for business investment or to support business development opportunities as they arise.\nAnd in closing, we remain committed to our #1 goal of returning Biogen to sustainable top and bottom line growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We will now open up the call for questions.\n\nCharles E. Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Jennifer, can we go to questions?",

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Q4 and full year 2023 earnings call and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one on your telephone keypad. Please limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. If you require any further follow-up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue. Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to Biogen's Q4 and full year 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today, are located in the Investors section of biogen.com. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables one and two, and table four includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted the slides on our website that will be used during this call. I'd like to point out also that we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectation.\nThese statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. On today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher, Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development, and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya, and Mike will each make some opening comments, and then we'll move to our Q&A session. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. A year ago, I had the an opportunity of presenting Biogen's quarterly results for the first time. At that time, we expressed the objective of returning Biogen to sustainable growth. I think in the intervening year, we've made substantial progress. Today, it is a great amount of pride and pleasure that we can announce earnings guidance, which Mike will go into in greater detail, which says that we are expecting to see positive earnings per share growth. As I have said on a number of occasions, once we can get Biogen growing, we really see Biogen becoming a growth company for the foreseeable future. We have very little, in fact, no exposure to the Inflation Reduction Act with our current portfolio. We don't have any new patent expiries really coming anytime soon other than those that are already known.\nI think we've undertaken a number of other measures that really reposition Biogen for growth. If I just review some of those things, the first was really to refocus the company on growth drivers, in particular our new product launches. Biogen had four new product launches from approvals from the FDA last year. That's the second highest of anyone in our industry. And you know that required quite an awful lot of cultural change. The multiple sclerosis franchise has been the stalwart of our company since its inception 45 years ago. Our people are passionate about the physicians who treat multiple sclerosis and the patients who have multiple sclerosis. And we are still a market leader in this space. However, that is a franchise that is facing increasing competition, and we have to embrace new therapeutic categories and new businesses.\nAnd so we have really had a major shift in resources and focus, particularly towards LEQEMBI, ZURZUVAE, SKYCLARYS, and QALSODY. We also, though, have still some products with patent protection, again, with substantial competition. If I take a product like SPINRAZA, analyst forecast had shown forecasts that this product would decline. Particularly proud of our teams in demonstrating that they could bring this product back to actually even modest growth. Obviously, the mode of administration of products can be a competitive advantage. So if you have a pill, you're going to be a lot more preferred than if you have an infusion, for example. But what we see in some of these really devastating diseases is that efficacy is still the most important factor. And that is why SPINRAZA continues to be a leader in its segment.\nBiogen is extremely good at being able to develop the medical evidence to support the value proposition of its products. As many of you told me when I first came into the company, you've got a mature product portfolio, but you've got one of the highest cost bases in our industry. We took steps to address that. But it wasn't just around reducing costs. We wanted to re-engineer the business. We were shifting our focus, entering new therapeutic categories, and we needed to think about capabilities. We needed to think about the agility of the organization, the number of layers of management that we have. So we implemented a Fit for Growth re-engineering project. We've already achieved $200 million of savings, and we're on track to realize approximately half of the $800 million of net savings by the end of 2024.\nThat's, of course, a gross savings of $1 billion. Then we had to look at research and development. Biogen is an extremely interesting company. All of the diseases that Biogen targets are really devastating diseases. There's a lot of pride in the fact that we go and try to find solutions for diseases where nobody else is doing that. But of course, when you do that, you're pioneering. You're pioneering because we don't really understand often the underlying disease biology of these conditions. So we end up taking a lot of risk, and these trials can be really quite expensive. Yet we do need a company like Biogen in our world. Our objective has been to really focus research and development investments on those products that will have the greatest impact.\nOf course, we have to manage the risk in the portfolio. We have to have Biogen as a sustainably growing company and one which is attractive to investors. We need the capital to go and invest in new projects. So I think with Priya's help, we've been able to take an extremely disciplined and objective view to the pipeline. We have four data readouts this year, again, on extremely important illnesses. And Priya will talk more about that. As we go into next year, we're going to be looking at how do we reinforce that pipeline? How do we rethink our research efforts? A lot has changed in science, but we haven't necessarily done that kind of change at Biogen. So I think research and development is extremely important to Biogen, and I think continue to be a source of growth for the future.\nNow, as we look at what does drive growth, clearly we have LEQEMBI. And I'll remind everybody that, again, we are not just pioneering in science, but pioneering in commercial. One of the interesting things about this disease is that if we talk about the efficacy of the product, in a lot of cases, we're looking at the characteristic of a product. But actually, when you talk about efficacy or you talk about, are you in the right patient? And in fact, for decades, our industry invested in drugs which failed to demonstrate a benefit in Alzheimer's disease. And there were two main problems with that. One was we couldn't get enough drug across the blood-brain barrier, and we weren't in the right patient. Clarity was the first study to really convincingly demonstrate the importance of reducing plaque and the impact on cognition.\nBut we know that from data that we showed at CTAD, that we believe that the earlier you can go, the more likely it is you're going to show even greater efficacy because we're not really in the business of trying to protect neurons or create an environment where injured neurons can recover. And so we have a huge investment in our AHEAD study to look at pre-symptomatic patients. We're investing in what happens when you remove the plaque and looking at maintenance. We're trying to make this more convenient for patients by having a subcutaneous formulation. And so the pioneering continues. And the pioneering also is out there in the marketplace. Patients with Alzheimer's are not in the system today and are coming into the system. So we've got approximately 2,000 patients on therapy at the moment. Now, we don't have, as companies, direct access to the patient registries.\nYou all know about the CMS registry, but there are a few other registries out there, like ALZ-NET, for example. We have seen some analysts have been able to access that data. There was one analyst report of 3,300 patients on the registry. Latest information that we have, and again, this is not perfect information, but we have an indication that there are about 3,800 patients as of last week on the registry. When you look at that, that suggests we're getting about 260, 265 patients per week in the month of January. And as far as we can tell, that's about a 56% increase over what we were seeing in December. So we are clearly seeing that there is demand for the product. We're clearly seeing that IDNs are moving to put in place the care pathways and the treatment protocols to improve access.\n70 out of the top 100 IDNs have had positive P&T committee decisions. 80% of those have now actually ordered LEQEMBI. But if we talk to the people who are doing the PET scans, the MRIs, and the people who sell the blood diagnostics, everybody is reporting increased activity and volume. And as you saw with Eisai's results, their belief is that for all the patients on treatment, there are at least three- or four-fold of those who are actually in waiting rooms. So we do believe we're making very solid progress. And we believe that we have validated the go-to-market model. And now that we have enough IDNs with reimbursement and care pathways in place, we believe it's also time now to increase our level of promotion out there. And so as Eisai has announced, we will be expanding total US field force by about 30%.\nAnd as was already previously agreed last year, that once we had the go-to-market model really validated, that it's now time for Biogen colleagues to also go and visit physicians. And of course, we've seen the launch in Japan. I was there for the launch meeting, and Biogen is very proud to be working alongside our colleagues from Eisai on the launch in Japan. And we've seen LEQEMBI approved in China, and that launch will be for later this year. So everywhere we look with LEQEMBI, we are making solid progress. This is, as we have said before, a launch that really doesn't have an analog. We have always guided investors to the fact that this would be a progressive ramp, and that's what we're seeing. And we continue to believe in the long-term importance of LEQEMBI, both to patients and to our financial results.\nMoving on to SKYCLARYS, you've seen the launch numbers for the US. We have about 1,000 patients now on therapy. We don't have a pediatric indication yet, so the potential population is about 4,500. So we've got a little over 20% of the patients on therapy within about six months of launch. There's an awful lot of complexity to launching these rare diseases, and I think this is where Biogen has an awful lot of strength. There's a lot of logistics issues with specialty pharmacy and reimbursement. And so we have already been able to demonstrate that we can reduce the time from the start form to shipment by 45%. We've got about 2/3 coverage out there in terms of reimbursement. And of course, patients and their physicians need an awful lot of support out there.\nSo we have patient services and family access managers who are assisting patients and physicians to navigate the care pathways. One of the things that we see with SPINRAZA is that we do about 1/3 of our sales in the US and 2/3 ex-US. We expect that to be a model for SKYCLARYS. Last night, we announced the formal approval by the European Commission for SKYCLARYS. We have an expanded access program in a number of European countries, and we are in the process of setting those up in other countries, including those outside of the US. We have a global filing strategy that is underway to make sure that all patients with Friedreich's ataxia can benefit from SKYCLARYS. Of course, we are actively working on doing the steps that would be needed to obtain the indication for children under age 16.\nZURZUVAE, postpartum depression, enormous unmet need, tremendous media coverage. We're talking about maternal health, and we're also talking about mental health. Those are two key trends in our societies today. It has been difficult often for mothers to seek treatment and get treatment. It's estimated about 80,000 women are diagnosed every year, but the incidence is believed to be way in excess of a half a million. So there's an awful lot of work to do to really get outreach to women who are suffering from postpartum depression. I have to say the initial indications of launch are well above expectations and very promising. It's six weeks of data, so I think we want to see more data to really come to any firm conclusions. Everything that we are seeing is extremely positive.\nWe were originally positioning this product for major depressive disorder, and we pivoted to postpartum depression. That meant we've had to go back and recontract with payers. I have to say I'm highly appreciative of payers because they have actually been honoring prescriptions, even though we haven't got all of our contracting in place. And I think that is actually also helping with demand. So with that, I'll turn it over to Priya because I think increasingly what we'd like to also start to talk about is not only what we're selling, but the new hope for patients that's coming out of our pipeline. So I'll turn that over to you, Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you, Chris. As we previously discussed, we have focused on reviewing and prioritizing our development pipeline with a keen eye toward maximizing probability of success and increasing potential return on investment, as Chris noted. The intention was always to focus our pipeline to better represent a risk-reward balance and one that we believe could help Biogen reach the goal of achieving sustainable growth. While this effort resulted in a number of program discontinuations last year, specifically in areas we perceived significant regulatory development or commercialization challenges, we also highlighted areas where we had deep expertise and promising pipeline programs and therefore warranted an invest-to-win approach. One such area is Alzheimer's disease, where we have an industry-leading pipeline, and we do expect to continue investing in order to expand our leadership. This starts first with building upon our opportunity with LEQEMBI.\nOur first priority is to continue working with Eisai to help ensure that LEQEMBI is available globally to patients suffering from early Alzheimer's disease. With approvals now obtained in the US, Japan, and China, and filings currently under review in 14 additional markets, we believe we are well on our way to achieving this goal. Second is creating additional treatment options for patients. The data presented at CTAD last year on LEQEMBI suggests that there is continued benefit associated with treatment out to 24 months, and that treatment earlier in the disease course had a greater effect on clinical outcome. For this reason, we are working with Eisai to submit a filing for maintenance dosing with IV LEQEMBI or every four-week treatment, as well as evaluating LEQEMBI administration in preclinical AD, as Chris mentioned in the AHEAD 3-45 trial, which is before the onset of symptoms.\nEisai also aims to submit a filing for subcutaneous version of LEQEMBI by the end of March. Beyond LEQEMBI, Biogen is also advancing pipeline programs targeting tau. We believe tau represents the next frontier in Alzheimer's therapeutics, and we are working to support the development of diagnostic tests and pathways. Our ASO targeting tau, BIIB080, represents a new mechanism for targeting tau distinct from prior antibody attempt. In the phase I-B study, we saw a convergence of target engagement, reduction in tau pathology in the brain, and improvement in exploratory measures of clinical outcomes. We are very encouraged by these results and are currently evaluating BIIB080 in the phase II CELIA study. We also have BIIB113, a phase I small molecule aiming to reduce the aggregation of tau.\nImportantly, JANE and the research organization is also focused on the future of Alzheimer's treatments and is pursuing a multi-modality approach to evaluate a number of other potential targets implicated in Alzheimer's disease biology. Looking beyond Alzheimer's disease, Biogen has an opportunity to expand our growing rare disease portfolio. We see rare disease expertise as a core competency at Biogen. I will now address BIIB121 in Angelman syndrome. Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs in approximately 1 in 15,000 live births worldwide. It is diagnosed in early childhood and is characterized by symptoms such as severe developmental delays, speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, and may involve seizures. While there is no specific treatment approved, individuals with Angelman syndrome will generally have a near-normal life expectancy. However, they will generally require continuous care and are unable to live independently.\nNormally, the paternal allele of the UB3A gene is silenced in neurons, leading to expression of only the maternal allele. In Angelman syndrome, the maternal allele is either absent or inactivated through genetic mutation, leading to loss of UB3A gene expression and impairment of synaptic connections and brain network activity. This can be visualized by an increase in slow brain waves, or called delta waves. BIIB121 aims to remove the silencing of the paternal allele in order to restore expression of the UBE3A gene. While the phase I HALOS study is designed as an open-label, multiple ascending dose study across age groups and dose levels to assess safety and tolerability, importantly, the study also utilizes clinical measures that we can use to assess therapeutic potential. This includes objective EEG assessment as well as clinical assessments evaluating multiple domains of Angelman syndrome, like cognitive function, and gross and fine motor skills.\nThe HALOS study has completed enrollment for the multiple ascending dose portion of the study. Last year, Ionis presented some encouraging early interim results. Overall, safety and tolerability support continued dosing in the long-term extension, with no concerning safety trends having been observed to date. The EEG data was suggestive of early trends to a reduction of slow delta wave activity as compared to baseline. Clinician-assessed clinical endpoints show a majority of participants demonstrating some level of improvement in overall functioning. Overall, we are encouraged by these early trends and look forward to sharing a more comprehensive top-line study readout expected mid-year. Following our review of those results, Biogen will be in a position to make its decision whether to opt in to conduct a pivotal study. Moving to lupus, this is another area with significant unmet medical need.\nWe currently have two phase III assets in systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. First is dapirolizumab pegol, being developed in collaboration with UCB, where we expect a top-line readout of the phase III study mid-year this year. If positive, we expect to conduct a second phase III study. The second is litifilimab, our anti-BDCA2 antibody developed in-house at Biogen. We currently have two phase III studies of litifilimab in SLE ongoing. These studies are enrolling and utilize a 52-week primary endpoint. Litifilimab also has the potential to be a first-in-class biologic in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE, a skin-based autoimmune disease that can be associated with severe scarring and dyspigmentation, and can be distinct from SLE.\nAs I've previously discussed, we have focused on reviewing our pipeline to identify and prioritize the areas where we believe we have both sufficient expertise and confidence in the science to deliver meaningful new treatments for patients. While this initial review is complete, this process remains dynamic, and we are committed to holding ourselves accountable to efficiently seeking out scientific insights and continuing to build the pipeline with what we believe is the right risk-reward balance. While we look forward to four important near-term readouts this year, we continue to focus on identifying additional near-term opportunities as well as continued expansion beyond neuroscience.\nThrough collaboration with JANE and research organization, as well as Adam Keeney, our head of corporate development, we are taking a holistic look across the spectrum of opportunities with both a research and development focus to identify strategic assets that we believe can contribute to Biogen's growth story now and in the long term. With that, I would now like to pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nThank you, Priya. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide some highlights in color regarding our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'll follow that with some detail on our 2024 financial guidance assumptions. Please note that all the financial comparisons that you will hear are versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.4 billion. That's a decrease of 6% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $2.95, and that includes a $0.35 negative impact from the recently disclosed closeout costs related to ADUHELM. For the full year of 2023, total revenue of $9.8 billion represents a decline of 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency, and that's consistent with our most recent guidance of a low single-digit decline.\nFull year 2023, Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $14.72, and that's also consistent with our most recent guidance range of $14.50 to $15. Total MS product revenue was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. That's a decrease of 8% at actual currency, and 6% at constant currency. That decline is broadly attributable to competition and the impacts from generic Tecfidera. I'd like to now provide just a couple of quick updates to the MS business during the fourth quarter. First, for Tecfidera in Europe, in December, the European Commission revoked the centralized marketing authorization for generic versions of Tecfidera. In reaching this decision, the European Commission affirmed that Biogen is entitled to marketing protection for Tecfidera until February of 2025, which makes Tecfidera the only dimethyl fumarate treatment for MS that may be lawfully placed on the market for sale in the EU until that date.\nAlso, a Tysabri biosimilar is now launched in a small number of countries in Europe. We expect that biosimilars will continue to launch in H1 2024 in other European geographies, as well as in the US. Biogen has patents related to Tysabri, and we will continue to seek to enforce our IP. Although Vumerity grew modestly in 2023, we are seeing continued effects from pricing pressure and overall contraction of the oral segment of the market in the US, which we expect to continue to see in 2024. Now, an update on our rare disease portfolio, which includes SPINRAZA, SKYCLARYS, and QALSODY. In Q4, we reported revenue of $472 million, which is an increase of 3% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency.\nOn our third quarter call, we noted that SPINRAZA outside the US benefited from the timing of shipments in certain markets. This prior period benefit negatively impacted fourth quarter performance. While we expect continued shipment timing impacts for SPINRAZA in 2024, we remain encouraged by its overall performance. SPINRAZA outside the US was also modestly impacted by pricing pressure and competition in Europe in the fourth quarter. As the market leader in SMA, we continue to believe that we can return SPINRAZA to growth over time. SKYCLARYS delivered $56 million of revenue in the first full quarter as a Biogen product, and we are encouraged by the continued patient growth that we've seen. Biosimilars' fourth quarter revenue of $188 million increased 8% at actual currency and 10% at constant currency.\nWe continue to explore strategic alternatives for this business and are working to ensure that we maximize its value for our shareholders. Our anti-CD20 revenue of $436 million included a $12 million operating loss related to our economics for Lunsumio. Contract manufacturing, royalty, and other revenue of $118 million in the fourth quarter was notably lower year-over-year, mainly driven by the timing of batches. I'll provide some additional detail on this dynamic shortly when I discuss our 2024 guidance. Now, a few things to note regarding fourth quarter expenses. Fourth quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was 25% of total revenue, and that includes $52 million of idle capacity charges. Fourth quarter non-GAAP R&D expense decreased $34 million, and that's notwithstanding approximately $45 million related to our portion of the LEQEMBI collaboration and approximately $60 million in closeout costs relating to ADUHELM.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expense decreased $44 million in Q4, which was driven by approximately $110 million in cost savings initiatives. That was partially offset by an increase in commercialization expenses related to the launches of SKYCLARYS and LEQEMBI. Next, a brief update on our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $6.9 billion in debt, which puts us in a net debt position of $5.9 billion. In Q4, we utilized approximately $1.3 billion of cash for final acquisition payment obligations related to the Reata transaction. We also paid down roughly $350 million of the $1 billion term loan that we put in place at the time of this acquisition.\nIt's important to note that included in the $1.3 billion I just mentioned, $393 million was reflected in cash flow from operations for a one-time payment related to equity-based compensation for the Reata transaction. So, absent this, full-year 2023 free cash flow of $1.3 billion would have been approximately $1.7 billion. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow this year and expect to receive a payment of $437 million from Samsung in early Q2 of this year. So now I'm going to discuss our full-year 2024 guidance ranges and assumptions. We expect full-year 2024 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16. And that reflects expected EPS growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint of the range compared to 2023.\nWhile total revenue is expected to decline by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage, we expect our core pharmaceutical revenue, or product revenue, plus Biogen's 50% share of LEQEMBI revenue net of cost of sales and royalties to be relatively flat for 2024 as compared to 2023. This assumption is driven by the expected increase in revenue from new product launches over the course of the year, roughly offsetting the declines in our MS product revenue. As has been the case in previous years, we expect Q1 to be seasonally weaker quarter as compared to Q4 for our MS business in the US. And that's driven by higher discounts and allowances, and some channel dynamics. We also expect contract manufacturing revenue to be significantly lower throughout 2024 as compared to 2023.\nThis is in part due to completing certain batch commitments in 2023 as part of the 2020 sale of Hillerød, which is located in Denmark. We had manufacturing operations there. These batch commitments contributed roughly $320 million in 2023, which will not recur in 2024. The increase in revenue from new product launches, and decrease in contract manufacturing revenue, along with lower idle capacity charges, are expected to have a favorable impact on cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for 2024. We also believe we can grow our operating income at a low double-digit percentage and operating margins by a mid-single-digit percentage as compared to 2023. We expect this to be driven by improved cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, as well as lower expected operating expenses resulting from our Fit for Growth initiative.\nOn Fit for Growth, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings and $800 million in savings net of reinvestments by 2025. We have achieved approximately $200 million of savings in 2023 and are on track to realize another $200 million in 2024, which would put us at $400 million, or half of the overall net savings by the end of this year, with the remainder in 2025. In 2024, we expect our 50% portion of SG&A spend for LEQEMBI, which, as a reminder, is not included in our Fit for Growth assumptions, and the reallocation of resources for ADUHELM to roughly offset. With all of these considerations in mind, we expect our full year 2024 combined R&D and SG&A spend to total approximately $4.3 billion.\nWe expect our other income and expense line to continue to be a headwind this year, given the reduction in interest income and increase in interest expense as a result of the Reata acquisition. And so, in 2024, we expect an improving revenue profile, improved margins, and a return to non-GAAP EPS growth. Our number one goal remains to return to sustainable growth, and we remain committed to this goal and to creating long-term value for our shareholders. And now back to Chris for some closing comments.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nThanks, Mike. So we have a number of milestones this year that we'll all be watching carefully. You're seeing we have a scientific advisory group for LEQEMBI in Q1, and assuming a positive result for the CHMP, that should hopefully lead to an approval by the European Commission in the first half, later in H1 of this year. SKYCLARYS in the European Union, of course, we've just achieved, as we announced last night, and the European approval for QALSODY. There's an expected decision by the CHMP and the European Commission in the first half. We have regulatory submissions coming up, as you know, with the subcutaneous formulation for LEQEMBI and IV maintenance dosing, also for LEQEMBI. And then, as Priya has noted, we have four data readouts expected sometime mid-year for four programs.\nAs I said earlier, I think we are going to be spending an increasing amount of time focusing on our pipeline and building out that pipeline. So turn that back to you and get to some questions.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chris. Katie, could you please open polling for questions? Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you require any further follow-up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with Leerink Partners.\n\nMarc Goodman\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, good morning. Can you walk us through just the subcu and the maintenance approvals? Obviously, timelines, I guess, would be around the end of the year. But just talk about the impact into the market. Let's assume Lilly's on the market as well. They're going to get approved soon. So how do you expect this to change the dynamics and the uptake? And just give us a sense of that, please. And then also maybe you could just talk about the uptake in Japan that you expect. Thanks.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nOkay. Thanks, Marc. Priya, you want to just start with kind of the timelines, and I can hit the commercial?\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nSure. Thanks, Marc, for that question. So overall, we shared our six-month data for the subcutaneous formulation. At CTAD last year, we believe we've achieved the bioequivalence with the IV formulation. Eisai has communicated very recently about the FDA meeting that is on the books to finalize strategy for submission. Currently, the aim is still to file by end of March 2024 for the subcutaneous formulation. In addition, there is data on the potential and need for IV maintenance, and that is also being aimed to file by Q1 2024. So that's the plan currently. I'm going to turn it over to Chris for the dynamics and the commercial implications.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. So Marc, I mean, the main benefit of the subcutaneous is going to be convenience for patients. And as we talked about earlier, over time, we're looking at the AHEAD study where we could potentially one day get an indication for much earlier stage patients. We're looking at maintenance where patients should continue on if we get approved to prevent the recurrence of plaque. So the time on drug is expected to expand as we do these studies, and having a subcutaneous formulation at any stage of this disease could be quite beneficial. In terms of the actual competitiveness with donanemab, I think there's going to be a number of points. We do know that physicians are highly sensitive to ARIA and safety, and we have a significantly better safety profile with LEQEMBI than donanemab.\nThere's an interesting thing with the donanemab study, which their study actually followed patients until there was a decrease in plaques. So where Clarity looked at an endpoint for everybody at the same time point after 18 months, there was a variable endpoint in terms of time on donanemab. And so the stopping criteria are not quite clear, and I think we need to see what those are. If you need a PET scan, for instance, that could be quite onerous. Now, we don't know whether that's going to be the case or not, but I think we're going to have a number of variables with which we can compete with donanemab. And subcutaneous at some point will be helpful. Obviously, if we think to Lilly's guidance, it looks like donanemab is, in this case, going to be on the market before the subcutaneous formulation is.\nSo we're going to be focused on some of those non-subcutaneous factors and competition. And then once we see the label for Lilly, once we see the label for subcu, then we'll develop our commercial strategy accordingly.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nDid you want to comment on Japan?\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nOh, Japan. Yeah. I think we certainly have as Eisai is basically putting all of its field force, not just the ones for LEQEMBI, behind this. And you've got a government-managed healthcare system. So I think some of the complexity that we have in the US with reimbursement and different actors could be simpler. We do expect that there will be some of the same constraints in terms of access to neurologists, the PET scans. They'll probably use a lot more of the CSF markers than PET scans in Japan. But I think we could potentially see a faster uptake in Japan than we saw even in the US just because of the current system. So we're just out there since January, and we'll give an update, obviously, again at Q1.\nBut certainly, from what we're hearing from our own people in the field, that there's been a very positive reception by physicians in Japan.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. Next question, please, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nManaging Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one with regard to the bottlenecks on the Leqembi launch. Could you speak to maybe two of those aspects? One is your expectations for Medicare Advantage to get to the same level of coverage as traditional Medicare and over what timeframe? And then secondly, just an update on the patient access to neurologists. Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. So I'll have to get back to your question. I haven't heard anything that Medicare Advantage is any different than Medicare. So I haven't ever asked that question before, but I'll go check. But as far as I know, it's the same. The bottlenecks are still the same. If you think about it, if the data from the patient registry are accurate, and again, we don't have direct access to that, but it suggests that we've got almost twice as many people on the registry as we do on treatment. And so that says that in addition to the bottleneck of getting into the neurologist, that when you get to the registry, you've got a clear intent to prescribe. Because on the registry, at least for CMS, you have to describe how you actually validated the diagnosis.\nSo by then, you've triaged the patient, you've done either the PET scan or the CSF markers, and you're looking for reimbursement. And what we're hearing a little bit is that there is some challenge in just scheduling the first MRI because when we initiate the infusion, you have to have the first MRI within the first two weeks. So people don't want to initiate the infusion until they've got that MRI scheduled. And the MRI, there isn't an MRI capacity constraint per se, but you are looking for a specific date, and then you have to back up the infusion. So there's just, I think, until people get the hang of this, getting all that coordination. I think that seems to be where one of the bottlenecks is.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I thought I'd ask for something a little different today. You're CD40 phase III in lupus. My question is two things. One, the trial size, this was shrunk from 450 down to 320. Could you speak to the recruiting challenges and whether they bode well or not well on efficacy? Then secondly, the primary endpoint, this one has three components, but the FDA guidance appears to want one clear index like a BILAG or SELENA-SLEDAI etc. Is there alignment with the regulator on that? Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nThank you, Umar. I'll take that. So just starting off, I think we expect our results from the first phase III mid 2024. We expect that we'll need a second phase III if this is positive to generate the safety and efficacy to support a reg filing. We did make a protocol amendment, and this was really working very closely with Biogen and UCB, looking at the study design, balancing our commitment to execute a well-designed informative study with a desire to potentially expedite the delivery of dapi, if positive to patients in need. So we do think it's appropriately powered, and we continue with regulatory engagements and facilitate a discussion on the next step. So we think, yes, it is positioned to give us a clear readout on the therapeutic potential as of now, yes.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Priya. Let's go to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi all. Thank you so much for taking my question. Chris, can you walk me through some of the rationale for adding more Biogen resources to the Leqembi launch? And maybe kind of what's changed or evolved with your partnership with Eisai where you think you needed to add more Biogen resources in the United States? Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. Thanks, Evan. I mean, to be clear, we're adding both more Biogen as well as more Eisai. A year ago, the CEO of Eisai and I talked about the launch of LEQEMBI. And for the US, just discussed the complexity of the launch. And we've been through all that, and I won't necessarily bore everybody again with that complexity. But we just felt that we wanted to really make sure we understood the go-to-market model. In addition to these neurology account specialists, you've got MSLs, you've got some patient care navigators, you've got some people looking after KMEs in the region. And there's probably for every NAS, there's another two or three people who are actually out there in the field. And there's an awful lot of coordination that is needed.\nAnd even the role of the NAS is quite complex because you've got to go in there. You've got to work with the office around helping them to understand the safety. You have to help them understand what the care pathway is. You have to help them understand the reimbursement, not just for Leqembi, but there's the reimbursement for the PET scans, the MRIs, and for the care. And then finally, there's what people in the field have as a principal objective, why Leqembi. So we wanted to make sure we understood all of that. And to be honest, whenever you do these co-promotions, they require an awful lot of coordination between the companies. And we just felt that it would be simpler if one company went out at the start.\nWe were sure that we knew exactly how the role of the NAS was going to work in relation to the other accompanying roles that are out there in the field. We also needed to get a certain number of core IDNs ready and signed up because there's not a lot of point in increasing the number of people out in the field unless you've got enough sites that are activated and ready. Now we're more than six months into the launch. I think we feel very comfortable about how the role of the NAS works. We understand how long it takes between going to visit a neurologist or an IDN and how long it's going to take for them to be activated.\nBecause as I say, you can put an awful lot of resource out there, but if you're not able to pull the drug through, it's not a very efficient process. So that's just where we are. We're confident in that model. Obviously, we need to now reach out to more sites. So we're looking at this from both a geographic expansion, but also, I think, even within certain geographies, perhaps reducing the territory size because when these NASes go in, they spend quite a long time with the specialists. So it was always the agreement between the two CEOs that when we scale up, that Biogen would come in. But our objective is to make the joint venture as efficient as possible. And so we just felt that the efficiency at the start would be maximized if we had one company in the field.\nNow, we've obviously learned from that, and that's what also gives us the confidence to put two companies out into the field immediately in Japan, for example, because while there are differences in the market, a number of the dynamics would be the same pretty much in most markets. So it is an increase. Eisai is increasing their resource, and Biogen will be out there as well. And that could still evolve over time. We're going to be in this business together for many years to come.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chris. Let's move to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Paul Matteis with Stifel.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nHi. This is James on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. Just one more on the lecanemab subcu and specifically in treatment naive patients. Just wondering if you're confident that you have enough data from a regulatory perspective here, if you've aligned with regulators, you and Eisai aligned with regulators, and specifically if you have enough safety data in that treatment naive patient population. Any color there would be great. Thanks.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nSure. So yes. So overall, this has been a topic that we've discussed. Eisai and Biogen have discussed with the FDA. And just to step back, the design was to add a sub-study, a subcutaneous sub-study in the phase III CLARITY study, open label extension. And the cohort that was treatment naive from lecanemab was about 72 patients. And then there was a whole cohort of 322 additional patients that provided safety and tolerability. So the 72 patients is the premise for the PK/PD and bioequivalents, but there's a larger subset of data that speaks to the safety data. So yes, discussions are ongoing, but overall, these have been discussed with regulators prior to starting them. Thank you.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThanks, Priya. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen.\n\nPhil Nadeau\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotechnology Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGood morning. Question on SKYCLARYS following last night's approval in the EU. Chris highlighted the importance of the ex-US markets. Could you discuss the expected cadence and trajectory of SKYCLARYS' launch outside the US? In Europe in particular, when will it be available in the major territories? And would you expect the uptake in those major territories to be as fast as it has been here in the United States? Thanks.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nSo there's two aspects, I guess, to the launch. One is the early access programs, and the other is the formal launch. So for example, we will be able to launch now in Germany with this approval. So this will be a formal launch. We still have an early access program, and any patients on that will now convert to commercial patients, remembering that actually the patients in early access programs in Europe are expected to be revenue-generating for the most part. We have another program that's up and running in France, and we are negotiating the establishment of early access programs in two other European countries. And there are some early access programs under discussion in countries outside of the EU. And the early access programs are important because, as we all know in Europe, getting pricing and reimbursement can take some time.\nSo it's a little hard to predict just because we have to understand the cadence of these early access programs. I would expect that it's not going to be quite as fast as it was in the US. That said, there is some suggestion that there are some patients, the warehousing effect could well be in Europe. But as I say, as a general matter, just because of the time to get reimbursement in all countries and the fact that we are not going to be able to have early access programs in all countries, that that will be a slower uptake than in the US. That said, there's also probably more patients actually per capita. Remember, this is a disease that is related to European descent. So the incidence of Friedreich's ataxia is slightly higher in Europe than it is in the US.\nThe next big market opportunity would be Latin America. We are submitting in Brazil. Perhaps, Priya, you can give us an update on the regulatory timelines there.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nYes. I can comment on the fact that really we are trying to expedite our regulatory filings in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina. We haven't yet communicated the timelines, but our teams are working very expeditiously, meeting with regulators to really define the pathways that could provide earliest access to patients.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nWe estimate. It's hard to get the numbers precisely, but we do estimate there's around 2,000 to 4,000 patients in Latin America. When we look at the experience of SPINRAZA, we are expecting particularly Latin America to contribute substantially to our revenue outlook as well. As you know, there are very few patients in Asia just because of the genetics. We don't intend to be filing or launching in Asia.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Michael Yee with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. We had a question on SKYCLARYS. Can you maybe shed some more light on the dynamics of 800 patients to 1,000 and then the trajectory as we go forward into 2024? I know you mentioned there's about 4,000 patients, but how many of those are actually identified? Do you expect growth to moderate just from an expectation standpoint? Talk a little bit about the complexities in 2024 that you commented about. Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Certainly, the growth is going to moderate. Remember, when this product was in the hands of Reata, they had approval, I think it was back in Q1. I think it was February, if I remember accurately. But they were not able to commercially launch because of a manufacturing specification issue. And that did not get cleared until July. So in other words, the market and physicians knew the product would be coming to the market, that it was approved, and they were just waiting for product availability. So I think the warehousing effect was even greater than what you would normally see for any rare disease drug. Now we're back into the process of finding the patients. I have to say the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, otherwise known as FARA, is an extraordinarily effective patient association, and we're working with them to help identify patients.\nThere is a requirement, really, to diagnose a patient accurately: a genetic test. But this genetic test is not so readily available. And so we're having to look and make sure that the supplier of that test can make the tests readily available. And then we're also doing the contracting, really, to make sure that as patients have start forms, that they can quickly get on drug. So we'll be back to, I think, a regular growth cadence on SKYCLARYS in the US. I don't think we're necessarily going to get another 20% this year, but we're growing every month. And certainly, SKYCLARYS is contributing significantly to our return to growth in 2024.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you, Chris. Let's move to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Colin Bristow with UBS.\n\nColin Bristow\n\nManaging Director of Biotechnology, UBS\n\nThank you for holding. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to clarify something. In your slides, it says that the sBLA filing is now H1 2024, but in your commentary, it sounds like it's still Q1 2024. So if you could just clarify that and just talk to specifically what FDA is waiting to see. I think it was 12-month data the last time we spoke, but what is it within that? And then maybe just as a follow-on, you had three, four, five studies. What are the timing or thresholds for any interim analysis there? Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nI can get started. So overall, I think with the subcutaneous, just to be very clear, Eisai has communicated as recently as their earnings a few days ago that we aim to file by Q1 2024, which is the end of the first quarter this year. Just shifting gears to AHEAD 3-45, this is really a set of platform trials with different amyloid levels for defining preclinical Alzheimer's disease. So at a very high level, AHEAD 3-45 is preclinical Alzheimer's disease with an enrollment target of 1,000 patients, and patients need to have an amyloid level of 40 Centiloids or more. There's three phases of dosing with different doses, which is titration, induction, and maintenance. And in this particular trial, the outcome is a PACC5, which is a preclinical composite for Alzheimer's disease, where it's sensitive to patients who are still in the preclinical phase.\nThe A3 trial has a target enrollment of about 400, and the preclinical amyloid cutoff is between 20 and 40 centiloids. And then again, it's got a different dosing schedule of titration and then maintenance. Now, the primary endpoint for the A3 trial is really a biomarker endpoint. We haven't really communicated exact timelines. These are very large trials. I think Eisai and Biogen are very pleased with how they're being enrolled. And I think we'll communicate more. There is an opportunity to do an interim analysis. And Eisai has spoken to this, but we haven't communicated a timeline yet.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAnd Colin, just a quick note on slide 28, right? The dots, that does show Q1, right? We have a wording that says expected mid-year if there's something sort of in the middle of the year. So I get the confusion because it says H1, H2, but the dots are kind of at the end of the quarter there. So if you were looking to see if there was a disconnect, there's not. It is, they have said at the end of March is what we're looking at here. So, thank you. Priya, thanks.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nI think that was the latter part of the question. I'll just wrap it up. That, with regards to FDA, I think I mentioned previously, there've been a lot of discussions. Eisai has recently mentioned the scheduling of more meetings, another meeting. And so that strategy will be finalized. Looking at the six-month data, we are very encouraged with what we saw. We believe that the highest threshold, really the biggest hurdle, was to meet bioequivalents, which we believe we've met. So we'll continue to wait for more data, but we are very encouraged with what we've seen so far.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thank you, Priya. Let's go to our next questioner.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nSenior Biotechnology Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, thanks. I wanted to maybe circle back on the Angelman's program. I wanted to understand a little bit better Priya's commentary around the program. Can you maybe clarify the calculus that goes into deciding to participate in future development? Obviously, there's a competitive approach with Ultragenyx's program. Curious how you're thinking about approvable endpoints. That's obviously been a big question mark. How you think this product, if successful, would sort of compare, and any sort of commentary there in terms of the competitive set. Thanks.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nHead of Development, Biogen\n\nSure. Sure. So overall, just to step back, this is a program that Ionis, our partner, is operationalizing. And the way the contractual agreements are written, we have the option of opting in to take the data that we see mid-year and decide whether we would like to do a pivotal study. So that's how it's set up. And then to step back, I described it briefly in my opening remarks that this is a phase 1B trial. So this is a phase 1 trial that's being conducted in patients. It has a multiple ascending dose component for three months, followed by a long-term extension. So we will get data. This is across different age groups and different doses. So we'll get a composite of data.\nAnd importantly, we'll be looking for trends on EEG, which we know these patients suffer from the delta waves, as I spoke to, the slowing. So we'll be looking at that as well as clinical endpoints. And very specifically, there are quite a few clinical endpoints. There's the Bailey score, there's the CGI, and there's the Vineland. We'll be looking at all of them. Stepping out into what do we feel about the competitive landscape, we feel that this, as designed, the program is well positioned. Just from an ASO perspective, the backbone of the BIIB121 ASO, we believe, is different. That's one from the Ultragenyx ASO. Second, we believe that the dosing may be needed at a quarterly level to really see the PK/PD impact that we need to make an impact in this disease. And we do have a three-monthly dosing in the LT.\nThe MAD is two doses being given one month apart, and then the third dose two months later, and then patients go into a three-month dosing. We feel that we will have a dataset that we can look at and really assess whether we see an adequate signal to really take it into a phase 3. With regards to Roche discontinuing their program, we believe, again, that this is a different product, and we believe we may have a competitive advantage. Ultimately, of course, we need to see the data.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nThank you, Priya. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next. I'm Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe if you can comment a little bit on the previous comment you made regarding SPINRAZA return to growth, what is happening in the market right now, and how do you plan to get back to growth on this product? Thank you.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nSure. So as you know, we have an oral therapy out there. We have a gene therapy, and we have SPINRAZA with the intrathecal. So short term, I think one of the data points that was very important was demonstrating the efficacy of SPINRAZA following Zolgensma because there has been some feeling that Zolgensma wanes over time. So we're getting what we call switchbacks. And the other on the oral therapy is that there has sometimes appeared to be that the efficacy is limited to certain body weights. So we can actually go after more adult populations. We believe that only about 30% of patients with SMA are actually treated. Clearly, the pediatric patients are screened for and readily identified. But there are a number of adult patients where the disease is manifest, but it is sometimes difficult to diagnose.\nWe're back to the rare disease job of hunting for patients. We think, actually, we will be the most appropriate treatment for that patient population. That's one source of growth. Longer term, as you know, we have a high-dose SPINRAZA program in development, which could, if it's successful, lead to just one intrathecal injection per year. That would make an enormous difference to patients in terms of patient convenience and make SPINRAZA even more competitive compared to the others. Now, that's still going to take a number of years, but we do expect that still to come to market before the patent on SPINRAZA occurs.\n\nMike McDonnell\n\nCFO, Biogen\n\nYeah. And I'll just quickly add to that, Mohit, that, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, there tends to be some lumpiness quarter over quarter, particularly outside of the US with shipments. But overall, when you look at the full year of 2023, we actually saw modest growth in the US, modest decline OUS, and overall, moving back toward the modest growth trajectory that we're hoping for. And we are pleased with how that franchise has stabilized over time.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nYeah. There's a dynamic as sort of the oral comes into a market at one point or the gene therapy comes into a market. If you have 100% market share and a competitor comes in, mathematically, you're going to lose market share.\nBut what we see is that there is some churn for a year or two, and then the market settles out, and that's when people start focusing on efficacy and patient populations. And as I say, so far, we have been able to maintain leadership in SMA despite the competition. And I think that's where they'll be. There'll be different products for different patients, but there's still enough of a patient population. And even with these switchbacks, we can find reservoirs of growth.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nGreat. Thanks. And operator, can we move to our last question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nHey, guys. This is Matt on for Jay. Thanks so much for taking our questions, and Jay sends his regards. So we were wondering, I guess it's still early, of course, but the PPD launch so far, just in terms of any metrics or signals that you see that support your confidence in the launch so far and, of course, over the next few months to quarters, what kind of metrics do you believe will become meaningful and that you might plan to share? And maybe just your overall longer-term goals for that PPD launch and your general interest in the psychiatry space would be interesting to hear as well. I really appreciate the question.\n\nChris Viehbacher\n\nPresident and CEO, Biogen\n\nSure. Thanks, Stunt Double. So there are a number of things that I think are quite encouraging. One is our initial target has been high-prescribing psychiatrists in this space as well as OB/GYNs. One of the things that we were wondering about is, are the OB/GYNs really going to be willing to prescribe? One of the encouraging signs is that they, in fact, are doing so. We're seeing quite a high percentage of the prescriptions coming from them. Another has been, I think, as I mentioned earlier, that payers have really wanted to ensure access to patients. As I say, I'm quite thankful to them. I think Medicaid, for example, where 40% of births occur, have moved very quickly on that in a number of states.\nAnd some of the large, at least one of the large commercial insurers is moving much quicker than we expected as well. So I think the reimbursement is a key statistic. Now, personally, I'm interested in knowing how many patients are treatment naive versus people who have been on treatment. What is interesting, is there a warehousing effect here as well? There's been an awful lot of media coverage. The product was approved in July. We were not able to launch because of the DEA inspection until the very end of 2023. So what we don't know is, are we seeing a bolus of patients come in because these are patients physicians have been following for some time who've been identified as being particularly important to have ZURZUVAE?\nSo I think we'll need to see a little bit more data about who are the patients and where are they coming from. But as I say, so far, we're running for the first month, I mean, we're certainly doing much better than what we had anticipated. And we'll give you another update at Q1. We'll sit with Sage sometime in March to look at the data and say, \"What do we see as some of the trends?\" But so far, so good.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Biogen\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chris. That will conclude our call. Appreciate you all joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect."

Good morning, my name is Ally and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Q3 2023 Earnings call and business update. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one on your cellphone keypad.\nPlease limit yourself to one question to allow other participants time for questions. If you require any further follow up, you may press star one again to rejoin the queue. Today's conference is being recorded, thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Ally. Good morning and welcome to Biogen's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin I'll remind you that the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today are located in the investors section of biogen.com. Our GAAP financials are provided in tables 1 and 2 and table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call.\nI would  like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nSo, on today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya, and Mike will each make some opening comments and then we'll move to the Q&A session. And to allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you very much, Chuck. Good morning, all. I think we released a very good set of results this morning ahead of expectations. But of course, we're all too consciously aware that really what most of you are interested in is where's Biogen going. To that end, we outlined five priorities that we believed we needed to achieve to put Biogen in a position to be able to grow again sustainably. I think in the first nine months of the year, we've made an awful lot of progress. And indeed, I would say, the third quarter was a particularly busy quarter.\nTo remind you all what those priorities were really was to focus our teams and our resources on new product launches. And that is a little easier said than done. We're a company that has a long heritage in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. And teams get very passionate about patient outcomes and working with physicians and to move them to new areas does require a concerted effort.\nThe other thing we wanted to do is to stabilize and grow again, those existing products that still have market exclusivity for a significant period of time, notably VUMERITY and SPINRAZA. The third thing was to really look at our cost base. Although we had a relatively mature product portfolio, we had one of the higher OpEx to sales ratios among our peer group. And we needed to address that. But more than that, we needed to really reallocate our resources.\nFourth was to really look at our research and development pipeline, particularly for the longer term growth outlook. We have really taken a deep dive into research and development, looked at those products, projects that perhaps no longer fulfil their original target product profile, where the practice of medicine had changed, where the probability of success had changed. And we have terminated those programs, so that we can focus on those assets that we think have the most promise. And I think we have a number of those, any one of which could actually meaningfully add to our longer term growth.\nAnd the final thing was, we said right at the outset, we were interested in external growth. We always knew that the LEQEMBI launch was going to be a gradual launch. We always knew that. Also, even the zuranolone launch was an unconventional launch. And to derisk that profile, we wanted to look at external growth. And of course, we've been able to do that. So, as I look at where we are, in the third quarter, we actually had – LEQEMBI was the first anti-amyloid antibody to receive traditional approval for early Alzheimer's disease.\nZURZUVAE was a mixed bag. We got an important indication with postpartum depression. But of course, we missed on the major depressive disorder. As expected, we've received Schedule IV listing from the DEA. And we also had QALSODY approved for treating a genetic cause of ALS. This is not necessarily a product that is going to be of interest to many of you from the revenue potential. But scientifically, this is a major milestone and validating the biomarker neurofilament, I think, will enable so many researchers to find further treatments for ALS and perhaps other diseases.\nAs I noted, we closed the acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals, and that gives us a whole new growth opportunity. SKYCLARYS is off to a very strong launch, and we'll talk about that in a minute. But it also builds out our rare disease portfolio. As you know, we are trying to move into some adjacencies just given the risk of the neurological conditions that we have tended to focus on. And rare diseases has been a logical place for us to go. Biogen has been very successful with the launch of SPINRAZA and we think we can do the same with SKYCLARYS.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we had the Fit for Growth program, and this wasn't just about cost reduction, because we do want to reinvest some of that, but we really needed to simplify the organizational structure, to empower the organization more, and move more of the decision making closer to markets and customers. We have ended up taking an entire layer enterprise-wide out of the organization and, in some parts of the organization, even two layers of that.\nSo, we do think those cost savings will add meaningfully to our earnings per share as we look forward. But I'm also looking forward to a significant change culturally and how we allocate capital and the agility and the ability to take decisions in the organization. Could I move to the next slide, please?\nSo, let's talk about LEQEMBI, a subject I'm sure all of you are very interested in. We have always guided that this was going to be a gradual launch. And we know that partly from the ADUHELM experience, but also just from the fundamentals of what we're doing.\nThis is a product that needs to be administered within a treatment process or care network. And those care networks did not exist at the time of the launch. So, they have to be built. And doing that requires actually quite a significant change to the work patterns within clinics. And whilst IDMs and clinics are working really hard to put these in place, it of course, takes time.\nAnd I think a terrific example of that is the announcement recently by the Cleveland Clinic. We all know that the Cleveland Clinic is one of the most widely respected medical centers anywhere in the world. And they recently announced that they had just infused their first patient with LEQEMBI months after the approval. And I think that just speaks to the complexity that we're dealing with. And in a lot of ways, we not only are pioneering science, we're pioneering this this commercial approach.\nSo, of course, we have an aim of getting to 10,000 patients by the end of March. We're at 800 now. What gives us the confidence that we think we can get there? I think we have a number of greenshoots here, signs of progress. The first is, as we look at our internal metrics of intent to treat and patient demand, we are seeing all of those things progress extremely\nnicely. The FDA not only provided traditional approval, but CMS actually moved very quickly, the day of traditional approval, as they promised. They actually have provided reimbursement and the patient registry has so far from what we hear from the market and been relatively easy to use.\nWe had some confusion around the reimbursement of amyloid PET. And CMS has clarified that. Now, of course, it's going to take a little time for that to flow down through to the max. But I think that will also relieve some of the confusion out there.\nI think one of the most interesting things is, we've got 60% of the top 100 targeted IDMs now having P&T approval. And one of the things that really gives me a lot of inspiration is usually these P&T committees meet twice a year, but a number of them actually have organized special meetings just for LEQEMBI and not wait until the next meeting. And that says to me that there's a recognition of the importance of this treatment and being able to get patients on treatment.\nSo, where do we also go from here? Remember, a year ago from here, there was still skepticism about whether reducing amyloid plaque would really have a benefit. And it wasn't really till the CLARITY study was finally presented at CTAD last year, that we really had, for the first time, clear compelling evidence of the benefit of removing these amyloid plaques.\nAnd now of course, we can go and say, all right, that's tremendous. But why is that so tremendous? Well, for years, we've been trying to develop antibodies, and those antibodies failed. And that's what gave rise to the skepticism. Which were the right patients? Which was the right antibody that was going to get the right amount of drug into the brain? And LEQEMBI is really the first one to show that clear, compelling evidence that that has occurred.\nNow, of course, we all want to get fancy. And that's where we're going. And we just had CTAD this year and think about what we've just done. We are generating more data to really demonstrate the benefit of this treatment. We've seen, for instance, that the subcutaneous treatment is going to work, that we have comparability with the infusion, and this means so much for the convenience of patients.\nBut this is no mean task either. Others have tried to do this. How do you get enough drug through the muscle tissue and into the brain? That has been achieved and is a major milestone. We've been looking at maintenance dosing. What happens when you've cleared the plaque? Does the plaque come back? Well, we have 24 months data now that shows a lot of benefit of staying on treatment.\nThen, the question is still who's the right patient? And data were shown with early stage patients with low levels of TAU. And those are fascinating data. We had 76% of those patients stable over the course of measurement. And very intriguing and very interesting. We actually saw with 60% of those patients that we actually saw some clinical benefit, as measured by the CDR sum of boxes, completely unexpected. That generated an awful lot of discussion at CTAD.\nSo now, of course, we're also looking at executing on geographic expansion. We've had the recent approval of Japan and I'm traveling to Japan early in the new year to be with my friend and colleague, the CEO of Eisai to launch LEQEMBI in Japan. And of course, we've got global filings under review in the EU, China and 10 other markets.  So, this is one where we're going to have to be patient, but all the signs are green at this moment. And for us, internally, we see a launch that is on track. But as we've always said, there's no real analogues. And every month, we learn something new. If I could move to the next slide, please, Chuck.\nNow, let's talk about SKYCLARYS, something that is much different. And as you know, we now have 1,180 start forms to date, with about 860 patients actually on drug. When we look at all of the known analogues, we're actually exceeding all of those, including SPINRAZA at the same point in time.\nNow, we have to be a little cautious because we all know that there would likely have been a number of patients ready and waiting by physicians. And I think that was even more of the case because, you may recall, that the product was actually approved in the spring, but then delayed for a couple of months due to a technical and temporary challenge on supply. And so, I think there was an anticipation.\nNonetheless, there's a very strong desire to see this product come. And we're actually seeing a lot of requests from countries around the world to make SKYCLARYS available. And that just speaks to, I think, the understanding that this is the very first treatment that has ever been approved for Friedrich's ataxia. This is an incredibly debilitating disease that affects so many young people right in the prime of their life. And so, it's extremely important that they benefit from that.\nWe had about $43 million of sales in the third quarter. One of the things that we are now working on and I think this is where Biogen can really add value is why is there 1,180 on start forms and 860 on drugs? Well, there are a number of things. Trying to get reimbursement, you need genetic tests, we need to measure your liver enzymes before you go on the product. And one of the differences from SPINRAZA is that they're not all incentives. They could be out there in in primary care, physician care. And Biogen is well equipped to do that.\nWe are used to providing genetic tests. We don't worry about the reimbursement. We provide those. We have mobile labs, so that we can help patients who are not there to major medical centers to get, for instance, the lab enzymes done. And also, we know how to pull through these start forms and navigate the difficult reimbursement situation.\nSo, I think not only is there an advantage for Biogen in getting this important medicine to patients around the world, but I think even in the United States, we can actually make this more rapidly available to patients. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nThank you, Chris. This was an exciting quarter for Biogen's development organization with the approval of ZURZUVAE in postpartum depression, as well as important new data presented for LEQEMBI and our tau-targeting ASO, BIIB080, two programs we believe that are critical to expanding Biogen's leadership in Alzheimer's disease.\nStarting with LEQEMBI, at CTAD last month, Eisai presented new data on a subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI. We believe the interim results at six months showed that subcutaneous LEQEMBI was comparable to the IV formulation on the basis of drug exposure as assessed by area [inaudible], as well as amyloid plaque removal.\nIn terms of safety, we believe the timing, frequency and severity of ARIA-E was similar across IV and subcutaneous formulations. Additionally, overall the incidence rate of systemic reactions with subcutaneous LEQEMBI was also lower with mild symptoms, as compared to first time LEQEMBI IV treated patients from the CLARITY AD core study. We believe these results further support the intent to develop subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI and, if approved, may allow for greater patient access, improved compliance and convenience.\nWe've made significant progress in our understanding of the potential clinical benefit that is associated with amyloid removal in Alzheimer's disease. However, there are still very many key questions remaining on how to maximize the clinical benefit with these agents, including when to begin treatment. We believe the differentiated and straightforward design of the CLARITY AD study allowing entry of Alzheimer's patients with confirmed amyloid pathology, but low TAU burden allows us to gain additional insights into the clinical profile of LEQEMBI, across various stages of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe data show that in the low TAU sub population, which represents the earliest stages of early AD, 76% of patients showed no decline and 60% showed clinical improvement at 18 months, as assessed by CDR sum of boxes compared to 55% and 28% for placebo, respectively. We are very encouraged by these results.\nA second key question for the field is what happens when you continue treating after amyloid plaques have been removed? And why would this be beneficial? We believe that dual-acting LEQEMBI continues to support brain neuron function by also removing soluble, highly toxic protofibrils that can cause neuronal injury and death even after plaque removal. Therefore, with LEQEMBI, we believe there is a potential for longer term treatment to sustain or further the clinical benefit observed within the initial plaque removal phase.\nIn terms of data supporting this potential benefit, when examining the 24-month data from the CLARITY AD core study and the open label extension, we see a potential clinical benefit from continuing to treat with LEQEMBI. Specifically, the separation in CDR sum of boxes between the group that continue to receive LEQEMBI or the early start group and the group who switched from placebo to LEQEMBI, the delayed start group, was maintained during the six month open label extension following the core study, suggesting a disease modifying effect.\nThe clinical benefit observed in the early start group at 24 months is further supported by the comparison against participants from the ADNI observational natural history cohort that was selected to match the baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the CLARITY AD population.\nAdditionally, while the delayed start LEQEMBI cohort does not catch up to the early start group, we do believe a potential slowing of decline with six months of LEQEMBI treatment as compared to the ADNI cohort at the 24 month time point. We believe the totality of these data support both the importance of initiating treatment early, as well as the durability of effect observed with continued LEQEMBI treatment. As we aim to provide options for patients, Eisai is currently evaluating maintenance dosing or every four-week LEQEMBI dosing after the removal of plaque and plans to submit a regulatory filing by the end of Q1 2024.\nAlso, at CTAD, Biogen presented new data from the phase I-B study of our antisense oligonucleotide targeting TAU. In the new results in the small study for patients treated with the two highest doses of BIIB080, we observed favorable trends on multiple exploratory endpoints of cognition and function as assessed by the CDR sum of boxes, MMSE and functional activities questionnaire, when compared to the baseline matched external controls at week 100.\nThese findings build upon previously reported results from the BIIB080 phase I-B showing strong target engagement in the CSF and a reduction in the brain TAU pathology as measured by TAU PET. Biomarker data from the placebo control period and long term extension phase of this study were just recently published in JAMA Neurology.\nViewed as an underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease, TAU has long been an area of focus in Alzheimer's drug development. While many prior attempts using monoclonal antibodies have failed, we now see from the phase I-B study of an [inaudible] a convergence of evidence across soluble biomarkers, TAU PET, and exploratory clinical measures, suggesting a link between the reduction in TAU pathology and potential clinical benefit.\nAs a reminder, our TAU targeting ASO is a completely new mechanism, which unlike the antibodies is designed to reduce production of all forms of TAU, including both intracellular and extracellular species. One clear challenge that we saw with antibodies was their inability to target intracellular species. We believe these results, while early, are encouraging and we are excited to be enrolling the phase II CELIA study of BIIB080 in early AD.\nOver the last few months, I have spoken about our efforts to reprioritize Biogen's development pipeline in an effort to optimize R&D value and productivity. This presented us with an opportunity to take a fresh look at our pipeline, and identify areas where we believe we have both sufficient expertise and confidence in the science, as well as our ability to deliver meaningful new treatments to patients, while prioritizing resources accordingly. This starts with Alzheimer's, where we believe we have demonstrated scientific leadership and are taking steps to build long term impact.\nThis includes first working with Eisai on several initiatives aimed at differentiating LEQEMBI and providing options to patients. Second, continuing to advance our ASO targeting TAU as well as preclinical programs that span different molecular targets and approaches across the Alzheimer's disease biology.\nLastly, continuing to deliver new insights on Alzheimer's disease biology and long term treatment with anti-amyloid antibodies. On this point, at CTAD, we also presented new data from aducanumab, including new data from the emerge long term extension and the embark redosing study. We believe these findings can help support the field's understanding of the potential long term treatment benefits associated with anti-amyloid antibodies.\nBeyond Alzheimer's disease, we have multiple near-term inflection points across various programs and therapeutic areas over the next year. This includes regulatory outcomes for LEQEMBI in several geographies, as well as regulatory outcomes for other products. In addition, we have important readouts for BIIB105 in ALS, BIIB121 in Angelman syndrome, and dapirolizumab pegol in SLE, all expected mid-year 2024.\nCombined with the long term potential of programs like litifilimab, our homegrown asset currently being evaluated in two phase III studies for SLE and a phase II-III study for CLE, we believe our pipeline has the potential to support Biogen's return to sustainable growth. And with our partners on the research and business development teams, we continue to evaluate external opportunities. I will now pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael McDonnell\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Priya. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide some highlights and color regarding our financial performance for the third quarter of 2023. And all the financial comparisons that you'll hear are versus the third quarter of 2022. Total revenue for the third quarter was US$2.5 billion. That's an increase of 1% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter was US$4.36.\nTotal MS product revenue was US$1.2 billion. That's a decrease of 14% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency. And that decline is primarily attributable to generic entrants for TECFIDERA, as well as broad competition in the MS market.\nI would like to provide a few updates to the MS business this quarter. First, in Europe, we continue to see that some generics have not yet fully exited some of the EU markets, and we do believe that there may still be some generic product remaining in the channel. The pace of generic withdrawal has been slower than we expected, but we continue to closely monitor the situation and are working to enforce our legal rights to market protection.\nTYSABRI biosimilar was approved in the U.S and E.U which we had previously assumed. At this point, we are not expecting a launch this year, but we are aware that there are plans to launch a biosimilar in the first half of 2024. Biogen still has patents relating to TYSABRI and we will continue to enforce our IP. VUMERITY was a bright spot in the third quarter. We did see revenue increase 20%. That was driven primarily by global patient growth. However, we are seeing continued effects from both pricing pressure and an overall contraction of the oral segment of the market in the United States.\nNext, global SPINRAZA revenue of US$448 million increased 4% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency. The 7% growth that we saw included 7% growth in the U.S as well. And that was driven by patient growth. While outside the U.S, SPINRAZA benefited from the timing of shipments in certain markets. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of SPINRAZA the past few quarters and continue to believe that we're making good progress against our goal of returning SPINRAZA to consistent growth over time.\nBiosimilars with a third quarter revenue of US$194 million increased 4% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency. During the third quarter, we updated how we present commercialization expenses incurred within the LEQEMBI collaboration. Our 50% portion of LEQEMBI net product revenue and cost of sales, which includes royalties, will continue to be classified as a component of revenue. Now, Biogen's 50% share of all global commercialization sales and marketing expenses for the LEQEMBI collaboration will be presented in the SG&A expense line and will no longer be presented as a reduction to revenue.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we reclassified approximately US$39 million of commercial collaboration costs from the first and second quarters of 2023 to reflect this change in presentation. These costs were moved out of the revenue line and into the SG&A expense line, resulting in a US$39 million increase to both revenue and SG&A for the third quarter with no bottom line impact.\nThis change in presentation does not affect any of our agreements with Eisai and we continue to share LEQEMBI collaboration revenue and commercialization expenses 50/50. This change will allow us to be more transparent in our reporting, and it's consistent with how some others in our industry report collaborations. This change will have no impact to Biogen's bottom line.\nAs Eisai reported in-market product revenue for LEQEMBI in the third quarter was approximately US$2 million, our anti-CD20 revenue was US$421 million, and that included US$11 million operating loss related to Lunsumio. Contract manufacturing royalty and other revenue of US$304 million was notably higher year-over-year and that was driven mainly by the timing of batches and it also includes the reclassified US$39 million, which I just mentioned.\nA couple of things to note regarding the third quarter expenses. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was 26% of total revenue, and that includes US$35 million of idle capacity charges. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by product mix, and in particular this quarter increases in contract manufacturing revenue. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense includes approximately US$44 million related to our portion of the LEQEMBI collaboration and approximately US$37 million in close-out costs related to the embark trial for ADUHELM.\nThird quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense includes approximately US$82 million related to our portion of the LEQEMBI collaboration and that includes the previously mentioned reclassification of US$39 million in collaboration costs from the first and second quarters of 2023 from revenue to SG&A expense.\nAs compared to the prior year, the decrease in third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was driven by approximately US$100 million in cost savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in commercialization expense for LEQEMBI and ZURZUVAE as well as the US$39 million reclassification that I just mentioned. Next, a few brief comments on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with US$2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and US$7.3 billion in debt. And that puts us in a net debt position of approximately US$5 billion.\nEven though these figures include the majority of the payments related to the close of the Reata transaction, it is important to note that we expect to utilize an additional approximately US$1.3 billion of cash for outstanding payment obligations related to the transaction. And that should occur in the fourth quarter. We do continue to generate steady positive cash flow from operations and generated US$518 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. In the coming quarters, we will be utilizing a portion of our cash flow to pay down some of the newly acquired US$1 billion of short term debt that we use to partially fund the Reata transaction.\nNext, I'd like to provide an update to our full year 2023 financial guidance which takes into consideration three key recent events. One is the completed acquisition of Reata. Second is the regulatory approval for ZURZUVAE in postpartum depression. And the third is the modification that we made to our presentation of the LEQEMBI expenses.\nWe're updating our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a low single-digit percentage decline. And that is an improvement from our previous guidance, which was a mid-single-digit decline. And that's of course compared to full year 2022 reported results. This is primarily driven by the update to how we present LEQEMBI commercial expenses, which are no longer presented as a reduction to revenue. We are also updating and narrowing our full year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance to be between US$14.50 and US$15. As we have previously noted, the acquisition of Reata will be slightly dilutive to our 2023 non-GAAP EPS with an expected impact of approximately US$0.75.\nMuch of this impact comes from financing the transaction which affects our operating income and expense line, including incremental interest expense [inaudible] a significant decrease in interest income. Absent this impact from the Reata transaction, our EPS guidance would be narrowed to US$15.25 to US$15.75. And that's consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance.\nFurther for 2023, we expect some incremental OpEx associated with the Reata acquisition. And that will be largely offset by decreased spending for ZURZUVAE as we prepare to launch in the PPD indication. We also expect some savings from our Fit for Growth program in 2023. Looking forward to 2024, it is very important to note that as a result of the Reata transaction, we will have approximately US$6 billion less in cash that was generating interest income at approximately 5% as well as an incremental US$1 billion in debt at a blended rate of approximately 6.7%.\nI'd also note that, for the full year 2023, we've absorbed a headwind of approximately US$0.30 to EPS due to currency fluctuations. And this is a dynamic that we're watching very closely for 2024. I'd offer that we estimate every US$0.01 change in the euro versus the U.S dollar has a roughly US$18 million impact to our P&L. I'd also refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nFinally, a brief update on our Fit for Growth cost savings initiative. I'd start by reiterating that the program maintains the target of approximately US$1 billion in gross savings by 2025 as compared to full year 2023. Since we first announced the program, we have not made any changes to our planned level of reinvestment other than the acquisition of Reata and the regulatory approval for ZURZUVAE in PPD only, neither of which were included in our original assumption.\nThe expected impact of Reata and ZURZUVAE to the original program is approximately a net decrease in the expected reinvestment of US$100 million. Or said differently, we now expect an additional US$100 million in net savings, so the original $700 million in expected net savings increases to approximately US$800 million.\nI would also just highlight that these figures do not include the impact of the LEQEMBI commercial spend, which will now be reflected in our SG&A line and will of course continue to ramp up as commercial activity and sales increase. And I'd also like to point out that as before, the expense estimates presented today did not contemplate any incremental business development or any transactions related to the biosimilars business and they assume continued R&D spend on ADUHELM through at least 2025. I'm going to now turn the call back to Chris for some closing remarks.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you, Mike. So, we're already into 2024 in our AOP planning. And as we look to next year, we actually we have a number of milestones, which is nice to see. As I mentioned earlier, we have an EMA decision on LEQEMBI in the E.U and in China. We'll have a decision on SKYCLARYS in the E.U and QALSODY in the E.U, all in the first half of next year. We intend to have two more important regulatory submissions, one for the sub-Q formulation and also for the IV maintenance dosings, both for LEQEMBI.\nAnd then finally, we're actually starting to see some development readouts in the pipeline. We expect the dapirolizumab phase III in SLE in the new year. We have our ASO for sporadic ALS, reading out on a phase I-II. A Phase I in Angelman syndrome. And of course with Sage, the SAGE-324 program in essential tremor. So, I think we'll have a number of interesting news points for next year. And with that, Chuck, I think we can turn it over for questions.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Ally, can we please poll for questions? Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you require any further follow up, you may press star one to rejoin the queue.  And our first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.\n\nSalveen Jaswal Richter\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning, thank you for taking my question. Just on the Reata assets here. Now with the acquisition closed and the launch progressing well, could you just give us your thoughts around key near term value drivers including the launch trajectory, the EMA approval outlook for early next year, and then expansion into the pediatric population? Thank you.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nActually, when you look at SPINRAZA, SPINRAZA is a good analog. One of the nice things about the rare disease space is that we tend not to be so U.S centric. So when you look at SPINRAZA sales, it's broadly, not quite, but it's roughly a third, a third, a third between the U.S, E.U and then the international area. And we expect the same really for SKYCLARYS. So, we do expect significant value to come out of both E.U, but also in Latin America, perhaps some in the Middle East, Turkey, obviously, for genetic reasons. There is none in the Asia region. But we do know that there are quite a few patients, for instance, in Brazil and in Argentina. So, we are accelerating our efforts to file for approval in Latin America.\nOn the E.U, you never want to try to predict entirely the regulators. We have to respect their decision – ability to make a decision till the end. But everything we've seen so far doesn't really change anything in our view of the probability of this being approved in the in the E.U. And that represented, as you may remember, at the time of the transaction, we estimate about a third of the value of the transaction.\nAnd then the pediatric study, we are in discussion with regulators. That will be actually quite important, because there are a number of patients who start to become diagnosed as early as five or six years old, but certainly in that 8 to 10 year old timeframe. So, it's quite important that we get the pediatric study underway.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Can we move to our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital. -  We moved on next to Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nJust had one on LEQEMBI maintenance? When we think about the strategy, I guess the question is, do you have regulatory color on a separate maintenance claim, just given the emphasis on plaque reduction initially? And related to that, would there have to be an additional level of evidence when you think about maintenance with respect to CMS reimbursement?\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nI'll pass that one, Geoff, to Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nThank you, Geoff.  With regards to maintenance, what I can tell you is that Eisai has communicated that – as you know, we're getting it every four weeks. This is with the intravenous infusion. And this data is expected to be filed by Q1 2024. I won't be able to comment on what it would lead to, in terms of indication and such. But we are preparing the data for a potential filing.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Pariya. Next question, please, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go back to Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nHi, good morning. Can you hear me now?\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nYes, we can, Brian.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nOkay, sorry, I don't know what happened there before, so, thanks for taking my question.  Congrats on all the progress. So, coming out of CTAD on sub-Q LEQEMBI, I realize FDA discussions are still to be had. But can you maybe help us understand your latest thinking as to what's likely to be required for approval? How much, if any, additional patient data do you think you might need to generate at a dose you might go forward with? Might you expect to be able to file for a lower dose based on PK modeling? And maybe you could confirm whether additional patients who are still seeing flow through the trials there are still seeing exposure below the 125% upper bound?\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nDid you get all that, Priya?\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nYes, thank you, Brian. So, this is really -  We are encouraged with the subcutaneous interim data that we shared and Eisai shared at CTAD. Just stepping back, the subcutaneous study was a sub study in the open label extension for CLARITY AD. The patient population that was treatment naïve and where we were really assessing the PK/PD, which was the PK parameters, as well as the PD outcome of amyloid plaque reduction, was a subset of 72 patients. And in addition, the study was set up to gather safety and tolerability in an additional 324 subjects. So, the total study population was 394.\nAnd what we shared was that we believe that the subcutaneous formulation showed comparability and bioequivalence with the intravenous formulation, and it was between the confidence intervals of 80% and 125% of exposure. What we also noted was that the overall area under the curve was about 11% higher with subcutaneous. And we also noted that there was a 14% increased plaque reduction at the six-month time point. So, these are kind of the observations that we have from the data. We have had prior regulatory discussions. And we're now embarking upon additional meetings with the FDA to share the data with them and discuss next steps.\nSo, at this point, that's where we are. The plan is, as communicated by Eisai, to file for a BLA by Q1 2024. And that's really the update. Eisai has also commented potentially on a maintenance subcutaneous formulation and filing, but that is much later in the 2025 timeframe. So, that's where we are right now. I hope I answered all your questions, I'd be happy to follow up if not.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Priya. Let's go to next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we're going to re-queue at this moment, so, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, that is star one on your telephone keypad, we're going to pause for just a moment to start that queue. So, while we do we're going to take over next question from  Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. -  I apologize. We're next going to now go to Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to get a sense of how you think about duration of therapy, given your maintenance data. How should we think about modeling how long people might be on drug at this point with the knowledge that you have for LEQEMBI? Thank you.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nWhy don't you start with that, Priya, and then, I can finish maybe from a commercial point of view?\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nYes. Thank you, Robyn.  Just stepping back, as we think about the Alzheimer's disease progression, we know that patients actually have plaque reduction. But we have data from several sources now, LEQEMBI, ADUHELM and others that show that while plaque reaccumulates slowly at a rate of about 3% to 4% based on current understanding annually, the biomarkers actually reflecting disease progression continue to accumulate as soon as patients are off drug, at least with LEQEMBI and ADUHELM. And this is based on the A-beta 42 to 40 ratio, but also other pathological biomarkers.\nWe've also shown most recently at CTAD that actually continuing patients on the 24 month – and we showed data on that, which I also shared in my prepared remarks - We saw that while patients who were on placebo during CLARITY AD study at 18 months and then transitioned onto drug in the open label extension, they never really caught up with the what we call the early start cohort. However, they maintained their difference with the early start, which we believe is a disease modifying effect.\nAnd then finally, when we superimpose that with the ADNI data and the natural history data, we see that the patients who even start at 18 months actually maintain some level of stabilization on drugs. So, all these areas of evidence point us to the fact that really continuing drugs at this point [inaudible] is going to be important.\nYou're absolutely right that I think we are still evaluating what is the right frequency and for how long. And that is what the maintenance sub study, which is part of the phase II open label extension is evaluating. And that's the data that we are gathering. But we believe that drug will need to be continued for a certain period of time, and patients will need to be monitored.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nMore broadly, I would say, I've heard many neurologists say we used to think of Alzheimer's disease as a four to eight year disease, largely beginning with the onset of symptoms. With what we know now, a lot of them are saying we're thinking about this in 25 year terms. We know that patients start to accumulate plaques long before they have symptoms.\nAnd as Priya just said that even after you remove the plaques, there seems to be some benefit in continuing therapy. And as we think about that commercially, first, we have this AHEAD study that has launched looking at pre-symptomatic patients. It also raises the importance of blood based biomarkers because that's the only way we're going to be able to detect and diagnose, or at least triage patients initially at an earlier stage.\nAnd of course, that's where the sub-Q formulation also becomes important. Because if we are thinking of people staying on drug for longer, and I'm certainly not suggesting 25 years, but this could be a much longer period, certainly than the 18 months, and therefore the convenience of a sub-Q formulation is even more important.\nSo we are learning every day. I think we saw that at CTAD. We understand increasingly the importance of early treatment. We're seeing the importance of staying or the benefit of potentially staying on treatment. And so, that has all kinds of commercial implications and how we do more studies and develop different formulations. And it's actually quite exciting.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. And are now let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.  We're next going to Umer Raffat from Evercore. . Please, go ahead.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior MD & Senior Analyst of Equity Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for accomodating me. I wanted to focus on lecanemab sub-Q. And, Priya, I think you mentioned two things. One that there's a sub-Q maintenance filing, which is separate, which could be in 2025. Could you confirm if the dose is lower if it's a single shot instead of two? And also, the FDA interactions on sub-Q that you mentioned, are they a follow up to previously agreed upon trial design for sub-Q? Or do you think you need clarity whether plaque reduction alone will suffice for filing? Thank you.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nFirst of all, I think on the maintenance sub-Q, that is really a much later potential evaluation and filing. So, I won't be able to comment further on that, specifically with regards to dose. Because we first need to evaluate IV maintenance and that is really the next milestone that's on the docket here.\nAnd then going back to your other question of what is the purpose of the FDA regulatory meeting, so, maybe just stepping back, Eisai has had a number of meetings with FDA prior to the launch of the subcutaneous open label extension sub study that I spoke about and from CLARITY AD. And so, what we do know is that we do need to show bioequivalence on both PK and then we need to show comparability on plaque reduction. And based on the six month data that we just shared, and Eisai spoke to at CTAD, we believe we have achieved that. And so that's the first part.\nThe second part is with that – because we have an 11% increase with overall AUC, area under the curve, exposure and 14% increased plaque removal, at the six month time point, does that result in a different dose? I think that that is really a matter of discussion, and we would have to discuss that with the FDA. So, can't really comment more on that. But most importantly, I think the goal here was to show bioequivalence, which we believe we have achieved.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Priya.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And next we'll go to Michael Yee with Jefferies.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThanks. Great, good morning. I wanted to come back to a topic on the AHEAD 3-45 study. I believe that your partner, Eisai, commented there could be an interim analysis based on 400 patients and biomarkers. I notice that it's been enrolling for a while, but maybe it just sort of is picking up steam. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about the progress of that study, how you see that study and the status of patients getting in? Thank you so much.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nWhat I can tell you is that it's a very important part – the AHEAD 3-45 study is a very important part of the overall development plan for LEQEMBI as an anti-amyloid agent. And the reason for that, I think Chris mentioned it as well just a few minutes ago, that we know that plaque builds up – amyloid plaque builds up for many years. And then there's sort of a shift where TAU tangles start appearing. And then you have the appearance of symptoms.\nSo, over the last several years, there's been a lot of work on clinical staging and such. And we know that the anti-amyloid agents that are currently like – just like LEQEMBI, which is really the only one with traditional approval, is targeting mild cognitive impairment - patients with mild cognitive impairment as well as mild dementia. But these patients already have symptoms and potentially a burden of doubt.\nThe purpose of AHEAD 3-45 is to look at different levels of amyloid plaque in patients who do not have symptoms, and see whether the addition of an anti-amyloid agent like LEQEMBI can alter the costs of disease. So, that's really the overarching aim of a study like AHEAD 3-45. It's a very large study. As you can imagine, it's hard to find the patients. But we are very pleased with the progress that the study is making.\nAnd as Eisai commented very recently, there is the potential to do an interim analysis and think about whether other regulatory pathways are open with interim data. But we haven't really commented beyond that. These remain possibilities, but I think it will depend on how well we do with the recruitment and what the goals of eventual patient access are. Thank you.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nOperator, let's go to next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we'll go to Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn",
    "content2": "Great, thanks for taking the questions. Just a two part for me. Just was wondering if you can provide any more detail on the breadth of prescribing for LEQEMBI? I know you give us the 800 patient number. But, if you look at how many centers that's across, that would be helpful.\nAnd then, I know you made some comments on some progress on the MAC coverage. Any more details on the timelines there for when we might get broader coverage at the MAC level? I know there's a couple of MACs already covering, but anything there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nTerence, I don't have any real update on the MACs. There's, I think, what, a dozen of them and they're at various stages. I think by the time that's more – that most of them have got there, I think there's an assumption that that takes anywhere from 60 to 90 days to get through. So, towards the end of the year.\nOn coverage, it's one of the most interesting things is really just the diversity of situations that we see. I talked to some physicians in some major medical centers. They've got the protocol, they've got the treatments, they're putting patients through on a regular basis. But I've been talking to some major medical centers. You might think they've got this all handled, and they're still thinking about these protocols.\nAnd it's protocols around what's the right profile of the patient to put in this. There is a teamwork approach on this. And so, people have to connect on that. For some of the IDMs, they have all of the elements, but they have to connect internally with their MRI centers with the infusion centers.\nSo, it's a little hard to give you a broad brush. I would say, every day, we are finding more and more patients, obviously, getting through the course. We are looking upstream at a number of indicators, because really revenue is a lagging indicator between even, when we start looking at registry results, it's somewhere between four to six weeks before we actually see those patients going on drug. But some of those timelines are changing constantly. So, it's a pretty moving process here. It's just – every day changes.\nThat's where, at some point, we get enough momentum, we get enough of these barriers cleared. One of the biggest is still the getting an appointment with a neurologist. And that's where I think we're looking at what can we do with blood based biomarkers, which are now available not obviously to replace PET scans or MRIs, but can we use them to triage patients, so that those who actually get into a neurology clinic are the ones who are already eligible.\nSo there's an awful lot of thinking right on the fly, as we learn from this experience. Again, this is really one where there's – there aren't really great analogs. I know some people try to suggest the CAR-T approach. And while that is also a product in a process, the volumes, the scale of this is much different. And we're not obviously anywhere near as complex as a CAR-T approach.\nSo, for us, there's not really any analogues we can do. And so, we're learning on the fly as we go along. But like I say, every day brings progress. And all of the indicators are in green so far, and it is really just getting enough critical mass now of all the centers who've got these care networks and care pathways in place.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we're going to go to Paul Matteis from Stifel.  Please, go ahead.\n\nPaul Andrew Matteis\n\nCo-Head of the Biotech Team, MD & Senior Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. Chris, you just mentioned getting an appointment with neurologists. And then earlier in the call, you talked about the registry requirement not being as much of a challenge. I wanted to ask about the other components of the infrastructure here with LEQEMBI, IVs, PET scans and MRIs? How would you rank order these components of the equation as it relates to most and least challenging for centers to navigate? And how do you envision this kind of whole infrastructure network looking by saying next summer? Thanks a lot.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThe situation is a little heterogeneous. It's not quite the same situation in every center. But I would say, based on what we know today, I do think there's clearly, at the moment, the need to get an appointment with a neurologist. The reality is that there weren't that many patients already in neurology practices. They tend to be in PCP practices. And the neurology practices – neurologists were already busy. And we have quite a volume of patients now to put through those neurology practices and a lot of them are realizing, I may be have to staff up on here.\nDo I have enough business to justify staffing up and not necessarily with neurologists, but perhaps with nurse practitioners, others who can take on some of the parts of the care pathway. For some of them, it's going through their internal governance process and determining which patients, I think, appropriately at this stage.\nThere's clearly an awful lot of caution around ARIA. My personal belief is that, over time, neurologists will become more accustomed to understanding ARIA. Is there a difference between the asymptomatic and the symptomatic? And they'll have a lot more experience but they're looking at making sure that the patients who go through are trying to get to have the least risk of ARIA.\nI don't think the infusion center capacity seems to be a big issue for most centers. PET scans, there are enough PET scans as far as we can tell. It's really been around how do I get reimbursement for it? Is it just one? And it was more the confusion around, so, I think the clarity of that will just take one of the factors of discussion and time out of the process.\nThere is just at each stage, if you send someone out for the PET scan, the scan has got to come back, it's been interpreted by a PET scan reader there, but sometimes a physician will want to have someone in that practice read that. And it's just connecting, sending the patient to all these different points, even if you're an integrated delivery network. So, I don't think it's necessarily any one thing, although I would say, if we can do a better job of getting patients triaged even before they can get to the neurologist, that could certainly be helpful.\nBut I think it really is – this is changing, the practice paradigm for a lot of clinics. And they're all having to work through it. And these, of course, are super busy people. They've got other needs. And so trying to fit in the time to actually manage all this is actually a challenge. So, I think it's completely natural and expected that this is progressing slowly. But again, you see some who are racing ahead. And that certainly gives me the confidence that others are going to figure this out, too.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. And Ally, can we - ?\n\nOperator\n\nWe can go to our last question. And that'll be from Phil Nadeau from TD Cowen. Please, go ahead.\n\nPhil Nadeau\n\nAnalyst, Cowen and Company, LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for fitting me in. I want to ask about the SKYCLARYS EMA review? Could you give a bit more of an update on what the status of that review is? Has there been a need for a whole explanation? And generally, what's Biogen confidence that a positive CHMP opinion will be secured in the first half of 2024?\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nPriya, do you want to take that one?\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nSure, thanks for the question.  Overall, just stepping back during diligence, we reviewed regulatory correspondence. And we had a certain level of understanding of the topics. And subsequent to closing the deal, we have had more regulatory interactions, and nothing has changed our view, as Chris mentioned. We'd still expect to see an outcome in early 2024. So, that remains on track.\nWith regard to whether or not there will be an oral explanation, that is really something we don't comment on, because it's under review and that's part of the review details. So, I hope that helps. Thank you.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Priya. And this will conclude our call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And the IR team will be available later on, of course, for any other follow-up questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation, have a wonderful day."

My name is Ruth, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Business Update. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano. Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference.\n\nCharles E. Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that will follow the discussion related to this call.\nI would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our expectation. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nOn today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher, Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya and Mike will each make some opening comments, and then we'll move to the Q&A session. To allow us to get through as many questions as possible, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nI will now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody.\nI'd like to start off with LEQEMBI. And I think before we really get into all the interesting details of commercialization and competitiveness, I just like to pause for a moment. This is an historic moment in health care history. We're talking about the very first disease-modifying treatment that's been approved, full as received full approval from the FDA and reimbursement from CMS. And there have been literally dozens of medicines that have failed before this drug ever got to market. And that's important for a couple of reasons.\nThe first is that, there's an awful lot we still don't know. We are really at the beginning of a journey to really understand Alzheimer's disease and how we can affect this disease. But it's also going to have a big impact on the practice of medicine. Physicians haven't been able to really help patients very much beyond perhaps prescribing [ donepezil ] or products like that. And the treatment that we are proposing here really is going to change an [ awful ] lot of how physicians practice and treat these patients. So as we start thinking about intent to prescribe and how physicians are looking at things, we're actually not going to know that until we actually get out there in the marketplace and see how patients respond. ADUHELM did get approved but as you all know, we never really got out of the blocks and then really got launched. So this is really a first. And whenever you're first, we're going to be discovering an awful lot. And a lot of this is just not that predictable.\nI would, again, just call out kudos to our colleagues at Eisai within a very short period of time, you were able to get regulatory filings in the EU, Japan, China, Canada, Great Britain and South Korea. So this is going to be truly a global launch.\nNow we just had the AAIC last week, Priya will cover off a little bit more about that. But one of the things that has become obvious is when we start looking at donanemab and lecanemab, these are 2 very different products. And I don't think most people have actually really looked at that. Most people are looking at, okay, we've got an A-beta antibody and we're moving [indiscernible]. But there's a whole lot more to the story. And this is -- this is going to evolve over the next months and years. This is a -- these are different products. They have different mechanisms because they have different binding. They've did studied in different populations. They've been studied with different clinical study design approaches. And of course, they have a very different safety profile. And all of these differences are going to play out in the marketplace over the coming months and years. And it will be interesting to see how that is, but I would just caution everybody as we get into this and you see all of the data, there's an awful lot of subtlety to this, and it's going to be quite interesting from a commercial point of view.\nThe launch is underway in the U.S. We did get full approval earlier this month and CMS approval, that has significance also for others. This is going to encourage a lot of other companies to be investing in research and [ blend ] diagnostics. It's also, as you know, going to be an unusual launch. There's an awful lot that has to be done. We're going to have patient navigators to help navigate the process to understand how treatment will occur, getting reimbursement. We will be working with physician offices, an awful lot of change that will have to occur in the practice. [indiscernible] practices on a day-to-day basis. There's an awful lot of education around safety, making sure that the right patients are in place. We have reached out to about 700 centers to date. We're also getting reimbursement beyond CMS. We have Medicaid, for example, in 48 out of the 50 states so far. And we have had very good response from commercial insurers. So I think the launch of LEQEMBI is off to a very good start, and we'll, of course, keep you up to date as we get further information.\nI'll move on to another slide here. One of the things that we've been doing an awful lot in the past months is really making sure that we are well positioned for growth. And as we looked at the company, there's where we were. As you know, today, we have a relatively mature product profile. Generally, when you have a mature product profile, you'd expect the level of investment to go down. We have actually relatively high operating expenses when we benchmark versus other companies. Part of that is an overinvestment in legacy products, but we also have an extremely centralized governance. We've got many organizational levels. We have a low standard control. On average, we have a span of control of 3 and then as we look at the R&D pipeline, we've had 5 different heads of R&D in 10 years. And that's not good for an R&D organization. And as a result, we ended up with some products that I think were relatively high risk and high cost and not necessarily of the highest value. So we've been through an extensive project to really review those R&D programs.\nAnd as we looked at where do we want to be? Well, we want to be making more value-based decisions for existing products. We don't want to just remove the promotional effort tightly. Biogen is still 25% market share in multiple sclerosis. We have the highest market share by a considerable margin. And so there is -- there are an awful lot of patients who depend on Biogen products. But I think we can do that smarter. There's a need, obviously, to have strong investment in our new product launches. It's important clearly to manage costs, but shareholder value [indiscernible] optimized if we can really make a success of these launches. We need to get decision-making closer to customers. We want greater agility in the organization and we want to focus on high-value projects in R&D.\nExternal growth will really give us the opportunity to diversify away from rare diseases -- diversify into rare diseases, immunology and psychiatry. So we did this redesign effort. What we did was a bottom-up exercise to look at where do we used to be as a company [indiscernible] successfully launched new products? What kind of internal governance mechanisms do we want? What kind of metrics do we want? What kind of accountability? And so there's been, as I say, a complete redesign of Biogen and that will lead some cost savings. There are gross cost savings, which will be about $1 billion in annualized savings per year. Of that, we expect to invest at least $300 million in growth opportunities going forward.\nSo this is an opportunity really to make sure in this year before we get into the product launches that we were truly fit for growth.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nThank you, Chris. We believe that the traditional approval of LEQEMBI is a significant milestone for the Alzheimer's field. We also recognize that the pursuit of effective therapies for Alzheimer's is far from over. Biogen and Eisai are continuing to generate data on LEQEMBI across the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Amyloid pathology can begin years before the onset of symptoms. There is the potential to maximize therapeutic effect of LEQEMBI by treating earlier to delay or even prevent the onset of Alzheimer's. Eisai and Biogen initiated the AHEAD 3-45 Trial in 2020 to evaluate this approach. This consists of 2 sister trials [ in cognitively ] unimpaired individuals, aged 55 to 80 with intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid on PET screening and they will be evaluated over 48 months.\nWith the approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S., we also modified our protocol for the AHEAD Trial to allow for open-label LEQEMBI-rescue should patients progress to early AD, while being enrolled in the trial. We believe the clinical profile of LEQEMBI is uniquely suited for the early intervention approach, with robust [ block ] clearance, low incidence of ARIA and optionality of longer duration treatment to potentially maximize clinical benefit. We are working to improve and simplify the patient journey for LEQEMBI in early AD.\nWe have 2 areas of focus: a subcutaneous formulation where the auto-injector to potentially enable at-home administration is underway. Eisai recently presented modeling data at AAIC, suggesting that subcutaneous lecanemab for Biosimilar exposure and amyloid block reduction and biweekly IV formulation but with the potential for lower incidence of ARIA. Regulatory filing is expected by the end of Q1 2024. Second is maintenance dosing, evaluating less frequent maintenance dosing in the Phase II open-label extension. Regulatory filing also expected by the end of Q1 2021. We are also continuing to analyze the Clarity AD data where we have observed consistent reductions in both amyloid and tau PET and improved clinical outcomes as we aim to better inform treatment decisions for patients.\nClarity AD study did not use baseline tau PET as an exclusion criteria and enrolled a broad population of early AD patients with varying degrees of tau pathology at baseline. This important aspect of the Clarity AD study allowed the generation of data on individuals with low tau burdens that has not been collected in other Phase III programs. At AAIC, Eisai presented baseline characteristics and a new analysis containing the initial results from the tau PET sub-study of Clarity AD.\nIn this analysis, individuals enrolled in the tau PET sub-study were categorized into high, medium and low groups based upon tau burden measured at baseline. Lecanemab administration showed a clinical effect in the overall population of the tau PET sub-study and notably a large effect size was also observed in the low [indiscernible] population defined in this analysis which does represent the early phase of AD. We believe this data further supports the clinical benefit observed with LEQEMBI in the broad early AD population and again, emphasizes the importance of treating patients early.\nBiogen plans to build upon our industry-leading position in therapeutics for A-beta clearance and tau knock down by advancing a multi-target, multi-modality portfolio, inclusive of also other emerging targets in the Alzheimer's disease pathway. This is inclusive of programs targeting tau. BIIB080, a Phase II targeting [ antisense ] oligonucleotide and BIIB113, a Phase I small molecule aiming to prevent tau acquisition.\nTurning to SMA. The interim results from the RESPOND study were presented at the Cure SMA conference recently and highlight that most participants and investigator and caregiver reported suboptimal clinical status across multiple domains at baseline following Zolgensma treatment. This included motor function, swallowing or feeding ability and respiratory function. Potentially, we believe this is due to likely incomplete transduction of motor neurons following gene therapy administration.\nThe internal results at 6 months show improvements in motor function in most participants as measured by the increased total time to score from baseline with no new emerging safety concerns identified. Overall, we believe these results suggest that there may be potential for additional benefit with SPINRAZA treatment following Zolgensma administration.\nThe R&D organization, as Chris mentioned, has spent significant time and energy over the last several months in conducting a comprehensive review of Biogen's R&D programs as we aim to improve the risk profile and productivity of the pipeline. We made a number of significant decisions and identified the programs we want to prioritize and others where we assess the challenges resulted in a low probability adjusted return on investment and thus, were promptly modified or discontinue. We believe that this has resulted in a leaner pipeline with an overall greater probability of success and a sharper focus on key programs.\nThe examples shown here all have data readouts expected over the next few years. BIIB080, a Phase II targeting tau targeting ASO, which has Phase Ib data showing a time and dose-dependent reduction in CSF total tau and phospho-tau as well as tau [ tangles ] visualized via tau PET.\nLitifilimab, a subcutaneous anti-BDCA2 antibody, currently being evaluated in 2 Phase III studies in systemic lupus erythematosus and a Phase II/III study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.\nBIIB105, and [indiscernible] being evaluated in Phase I/II study in broad sporadic ALS, we expect to read out midyear 2024. BIIB122, a last [indiscernible] ASO being developed in partnership with Denali Therapeutics currently in a Phase IIb study for idiopathic Parkinson's disease and BIIB121, an ASO aiming to increase the expression of paternal [indiscernible] in Angelman syndrome, and we expect the Phase I to read out midyear 2024.\nIn summary, this past quarter, we continued to make significant advancements across our pipeline, most notably with the traditional approval of LEQEMBI in early AD. While our initial substantial review of the pipeline is complete, we will continue to evaluate both current and potential new R&D programs using a data-driven approach with a keen eye toward risk balance and value creation.\nI will now pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Intelsat SA\n\nThank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some highlights and color regarding our financial performance for the second quarter and all of the financial comparisons that you will hear are versus the second quarter of 2022.\nTotal revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion. That's a decrease of 5% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter was $4.02. Total MS product revenue was $1.2 billion. That's a decrease of 15% at actual currency and 14% at constant currency.\nSo a few recent updates to the MS business this quarter. First, the decline in MS in the second quarter was attributable to generic entrants for TECFIDERA and broad competition in the MS market. We did not see much in the way of channel dynamics during the second quarter. Second, as we did announce previously, TECFIDERA's regulatory market protection in the EU was extended by one additional year until February 2, 2025. Some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some of the EU markets and some generic products remain in the channel. The pace of generic withdrawal has been slower than we expected, and we're closely monitoring the situation and working to enforce our legal right to market protection.\nRegarding TYSABRI, we have previously said that there may be a TYSABRI Biosimilar launch in the U.S. and EU sometime later in 2023. We are aware of the positive CHMP opinion for the TYSABRI Biosimilar in the EU last week. And while we have not seen any Biosimilar launches so far, we could see an approval and launch in the coming months.\nMoving on now to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $437 million increased 1% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. SPINRAZA growth in the U.S. was 12%, and that was driven by patient growth. We were encouraged by the performance this past quarter and believe we are making good progress against our goal of returning SPINRAZA to consistent growth. Also, as Priya mentioned, we are continuing to generate data to support the efficacy profile of SPINRAZA and we believe that this, along with the expected overall market expansion should help enable continued improved performance for SPINRAZA.\nBiosimilars revenue of $195 million was flat at actual currency and increased 4% at constant currency. We are continuing to manage supply constraints for IMRALDI and BENEPALI and are monitoring this situation very closely. We've referenced previously that we are evaluating whether this business could create more value outside of Biogen and we are engaged with multiple interested parties and will provide further updates on that process as appropriate.\nAlzheimer's disease revenue, which includes revenue from ADUHELM, and the LEQEMBI collaboration equated to a headwind of $20 million to revenue during the second quarter. As a reminder, LEQEMBI revenue represents our 50% of in-market revenue less 50% of commercialization expenses. We expect this line to continue to be negative in 2023 as the ramping of LEQEMBI commercialization expenses will exceed initial revenue. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $433 million was down 1% and included a $12 million operating loss related to [ Monsumio ]. As a reminder, starting this quarter, our pretax profit share on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and [ LENSUMIO ] decreased from 37.5% to 35% and that's due to the achievement of certain sales targets for GAZYVA as part of our contractual agreement with Genentech. Contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue of $198 million was notably higher year-over-year and that was driven mainly by the timing of batches.\nA couple of details regarding Q2 expenses. For the second quarter, non-GAAP cost of sales was 24% of total revenue and that includes $34 million of [ idle ] capacity charges. We continue to see higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenue as a result of product mix and idle capacity charges. And in particular, the increases that we are seeing in contract manufacturing revenue increases our overall cost of sales as a percentage of revenue.\nSo in terms of modeling for the remainder of 2023, I'd offer that we believe contract manufacturing revenue will remain strong and will contribute to a higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of this year as compared to the 24.1% that we saw in the second quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense includes roughly $13 million in estimated study close-up costs related to BIIB093.\nAs Priya mentioned, we're now substantially complete with our R&D prioritization. We estimate that this will result in gross savings of approximately $250 million next year, though this will be partially offset by natural increases in R&D due to portfolio progression. The decrease in second quarter SG&A expense was attributed to roughly $70 million of savings initiatives, and that was partially offset by approximately $35 million of reinvestments mostly related to launch costs. We continue to expect our operating expenses to be lower in the second half of the year than in the first half as we complete the run rate savings from our previously announced cost initiatives as well as a modest impact from our new Fit for Growth initiatives.\nSo now I'd like to take a minute to provide a little bit of additional detail on our new Fit for Growth program. This program will include changes to our operating model with a significant reduction of certain centralized functions. A substantial portion of the $700 million of net annual OpEx savings are expected to come from a net headcount reduction of approximately 1,000, which we expect to rightsize the company with our business plan and enable us to return to sustainable growth. I would reiterate that the OpEx savings shown here are on an annualized basis. We believe that this is an efficient program with 70% of our expected gross OpEx savings to be realized as net savings. All in, we expect a very modest impact on 2023 expenses and believe the net OpEx savings will be split roughly equally between 2024 and 2025, and all of these savings are incremental to any previously announced cost reduction programs.\nA few quick comments on our balance sheet, including the approximately $813 million that we received during the quarter related to the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. On June 30, we had $6.3 billion in debt, and that puts us in a net cash position of roughly $1 billion. We continue to generate steady positive cash flow from operations with free cash flow of $416 million during the second quarter.\nAnd finally, now let me turn to our financial guidance for full year 2023. The business remains on track with our forecast for the full year. And today, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of a full year 2023 revenue decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as compared to 2022 reported results. and full year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16 and you can refer to our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nSo now I'll turn it back over to Chris for a few closing comments.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you, Mike. Well, in addition to reengineering our cost base, we're actually also reengineering the marketed portfolio of products. We've already had 2 approvals this year [indiscernible] and LEQEMBI in the United States. As we look forward for the rest of the year and into early next year, we have a number of other important milestones for our portfolio. We are expecting a [ decision ] by the PMDA in Japan in the third quarter, by the EMA in Europe in the first quarter of next year and in the first quarter of next year also in China. We also are expecting a decision by the FDA on ZURANOLONE actually next week potentially. And then we also are continuing to evolve LEQEMBI's as Priya said, we are expecting to be able to submit the regulatory dossiers for LEQEMBI subcu in Q1 of next year and also a regulatory file maintenance dosing next year.\nSo in addition to that, with the new product approvals that are expected. We're going to continue, obviously, to look through our external growth opportunities. As I have said before, this is an opportunity to expand the portfolio more into rare diseases into immunology and neuropsychiatry.\nSo with that, Chuck, we'll turn it back and invite questions.\n\nCharles E. Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, can we please poll for questions?",

My name is Bettina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Business Update. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Triano, you may begin your conference.\n\nCharles E. Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Bettina. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today on the call. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussion related to this call.\nI'd like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nOn today's call, I'm joined by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Viehbacher; Dr. Priya Singhal, Head of Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. Chris, Priya and Mike will each make opening comments, and then we'll move to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher A. Viehbacher\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Sanofi\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good morning, everybody. I'll start by first welcoming Chuck Triano as our new Head of Investor Relations. Good to have you on the team, Chuck.\nOn our last call, we described 5 priorities for the business that you see on the first slide here. And during the first quarter, I think we made a lot of good progress against those 5 priorities. We are continuing to work toward the potential launches of LEQEMBI in Alzheimer's disease and zuranolone in both MDD and PPD. And I'm going to cover that in the next slide because that's really, in some ways, a super priority.\nOn the next point on improving the risk profile and productivity of R&D, Priya will review the steps taken to improve the risk profile and the productivity of R&D, and you'll see that in greater detail.\nSo I'm going to cover a little bit more on the cost base. The first thing I'd like to say is that we've made good progress on the previous program that it amounts $1 billion of cost savings. That -- those $1 billion have been secured and have been -- that program is complete.\nBut over the last several months, we've been getting a better understanding of how the company operates, working with our senior leaders and thinking about how we operate at all levels of the company, particularly at a global, regional and affiliate level. And as we said before, we do have a higher cost base than the average company in our category.\nAnd so we've initiated an additional program to align our operations and cost base with the expected revenue while leaving enough money for the upcoming launches. And we internally refer to this program as Fit for Growth. And really, what we're trying to do is balance the opportunity for profitable growth by investing in our product launches and the R&D projects that we deem priority, with an attempt to try to reduce that cost base and get that back to something that looks a little bit more in line with our competitors.\nNow that's not just a simple job of taking out cost. What we're really trying to do is redesign the company. We have these 2 launches. They're going to have different geographic points of focus at the start. We won't have zuranolone for a few years outside of the U.S. Zuranolone is clearly a top priority in the short-term in the U.S. And outside the U.S., we're going to be certainly focused on the LEQEMBI launch in the first instance.\nSo one of the things we want to do is make sure that we don't lose what is good in the company and what has been working. We also have to remember that we are still a leader in multiple sclerosis. There are a lot of patients who depend upon our products, and we have to make sure that the physicians who treat those patients have adequate information. So there's a balancing act as we try to shift our resources behind the growth opportunities while still supporting our historic MS business.\nAnd so we're taking essentially a bottoms-up and a methodical approach to this. This could have a much different approach to our operating model. We've been 45 years in multiple sclerosis with a limited product profile. Yes, we had, at one point, some products in hemophilia. And obviously, we have SPINRAZA. And as a result, we had an awful lot of centralized cost.\nRight now, we're looking at how do we get a lot more of our resource and our attention closer to the customer. So it's a redesign effort, and it's meant to be durable. So we do recognize that there's an opportunity to reduce cost, but we really are looking at something more transformational that really sets the company up for growth. We'll be able to say more about that in Q2.\nThen another priority is really managing the base business. There's 2 dynamics in the company. We are a leader in MS, but that business is increasingly affected by competition. And we have growth opportunities with LEQEMBI and zuranolone.\nSo on the base business, the idea is how do we manage that business as profitably as we can. We did receive a favorable decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union related to TECFIDERA regulatory data and marketing protection, which was an important reinforcement of intellectual property and exclusivity rights. We believe this provides us marketing protection until at least February of next year, and we are looking to enforce that protection, but it will take a little time for the market to settle. And separately, we also continue to enforce our 2028 patent for TECFIDERA in the EU.\nWe're also looking to aim to -- we're looking to maximize the profitability of the MS franchise. Up until now, the goal has been to defend revenue at all costs. I think now we want to take a little bit more of a nuanced approach of looking at where are the opportunities in MS, where do we have intellectual property, where do we have still sales promotion sensitivity and try to align our resources with that and perhaps look at other means of promoting products that are a little less expensive.\nWe do believe that SPINRAZA can return to growth, and we are seeing stabilization out there in the marketplace. Gene therapy is not for everyone, and the oral therapy has its limits. And there are still quite a few patients that suffer from SMA that don't benefit from any treatment.\nAnd as we announced at the previous quarter, we do have a formal process underway to evaluate strategic options for our biosimilars business. This is a very good business, and I think especially with the launch of biosimilars for HUMIRA, we are seeing an opportunity for the health care system to make important economies that help fund innovation. And we need to think about who is -- and how is the best way to manage this business and who might be the best owner of that business.\nOn external growth, we're looking at external growth really from 2 perspectives. One is how do we balance the company a little bit more on its pipeline? It has been very neuroscience-focused. But as I've argued in the past, I think with MS, which is basically an autoimmune disease, I think we could migrate into immunology.\nWith SPINRAZA, I think we have an experience in rare diseases, and that will be reinforced with tofersen. And of course, we're in neuropsychiatry with zuranolone. So these offer opportunities to think about how do we build out some of those franchises.\nThe other is, I did describe this dynamic of the MS franchise declining slightly and new growth coming. And we may look at external growth as a way of making sure that, that transition is as smooth as possible from a results point of view. I'm pleased to say that we have appointed Adam Keeney as our Head of Corporate Development. Adam has over 20 years of experience, not just in business development, but also in R&D and strategy across both large pharma and he was the CEO of a biotech, so I think he's got some entrepreneurial spirit that will be very welcomed at Biogen.\nWe do see LEQEMBI and zuranolone as major contributors to revenue, but we want to continue to think about business development to support the growth trajectory and diversify, as I said.\nSo if I can have the next slide, please. So we've really got an unprecedented opportunity. We have today a PDUFA date for tofersen. We have a PDUFA date in July for LEQEMBI and a PDUFA date in August for zuranolone. I can't think of another major biopharmaceutical company that has that many new significant products to launch. That's a huge opportunity.\nBut as I said earlier, we have to think about capabilities on that. These are going to be in different areas. Obviously, LEQEMBI is a little closer to home since it's still the neurologist. But there's an awful lot of market building will have to be done there. And of course, zuranolone takes us into a much different area and a much different physician franchise.\nBut we're making our milestones. We received accelerated approval in the U.S. back in January. We filed for traditional approval in the U.S. On the same day, within the EU, Japan and Eisai initiated regulatory filing in China. Filing all of those dossiers in that kind of timeframe is really quite significant, and I have to congratulate our colleagues at Eisai for this effort. These filings have received priority review in the U.S., Japan and China. And of course, a major milestone in that the Veteran's Health Administration has decided to reimburse LEQEMBI.\nNow LEQEMBI is going to be the first anti-amyloid antibody to receive traditional approval globally, hopefully in July. As we said, this is not a straightforward launch. It's a complex diagnosis involving PET scans, [ lump or puncture ] for amyloid confirmation. Specialists who are already busy MRI imaging, biweekly infusion, and we know that capacity could be an issue initially. CMS reimbursement will be the next major milestone which we expect to have an answer on once the product has received full approval, as expected, following the PDUFA date in July.\nMore importantly though, we're looking at how do we right now alleviate those bottlenecks. Yes, CMS is there, but both companies are already thinking about what we can do to make this easier for patients and actually reduce cost. Eisai and Biogen are pursuing maintenance dosing and the subcu formulation. Blood-based diagnostics, as I've said in the past, are really going to be a game changer in this space. And we believe that over time, capacity is going to expand to meet the need.\nFor reimbursement, this is a big question. The Veterans Association is certainly helpful. I would just point out that compared to the situation that ADUHELM faced, we are getting a lot more support from Congress. The American Association of Neurologists has written in support. And I know that a number of patient advocacy groups are active in ensuring that patients have access to this important therapy.\nSo Eisai is responsible under the contract. We're engaging with CMS. And we would hope to see broad coverage coming out of the CMS decision.\nNow I'd like to talk about zuranolone just for a few minutes. I mean, zuranolone is still, I think, an underestimated asset in our portfolio. Unfortunately, a lot of people suffer from depression, so it is a large market. There are clearly a number of older medicines that are available. The main problem with those are the side effects of those medicines and the length of time it takes for them to work. And zuranolone works potentially in 3 days, and it's going to be a different type of launch because we're talking about a treatment that works in 2 weeks. The only analog I can find that is anyway similar was Zithromax. So we do know that there is going to be some need for education.\nPhysicians are used to treating on a chronic basis. As we launch it, and we're going to have to think about different metrics, one of the things in the launch that you look for is when do NRxs switch to TRxs? Well, we're not going to see that. There are not going to be TRxs with the product.\nSo I think there are these changes in physician behavior. This is a paradigm shift. And paradigm shift is not always a good thing in pharmaceutical marketing, as you know.\nHowever, what really drives us, this is a product that really makes a difference for patients. This is a product that will -- is efficacious, it works fast. And think about the freedom of knowing that after 2 weeks that you can stop taking zuranolone. So I think that is going to be an enormous opportunity. And I'll just finish with tofersen on this. It is not a big product, obviously, about 300 patients, but it's classic Biogen. There's a -- we have a long history in ALS, a lot of setbacks, but the organization has an ability to learn and adapt, and Biogen was able to partner with the scientific community to help characterize neurofilament as a biomarker in neuromuscular disorders. This is a huge deal because neurofilament will be relevant to a lot of researchers who are looking at ALS.\nSo I think we've got some groundbreaking science here. And this is where Biogen has had the resilience to go after a lot of significant unmet need that -- and has resolved things in a way that not everybody has been able to do.\nNext slide, if I could. We've got a number of milestones coming, as you can see here on the slide. By our Q2 call, we would expect to be in a different place with LEQEMBI. We should hopefully have the PDUFA date behind us successfully. Hopefully, we've received a traditional approval and broader CMS coverage in the U.S. And of course, we'll be communicating more about our Fit for Growth cost optimization program.\nBy the end of this year, hopefully, we've got the first U.S. approval of LEQEMBI in Japan. And hopefully, we'll have received the approval for zuranolone in both MDD and PPD as well as having completed a 3-month DEA scheduling period and initiated the launch.\nAnd if I look further ahead, by the end of -- by this time next year, I think we have an opportunity to build the global footprint of LEQEMBI with approvals in Europe and China. And of course, we'll take the next steps on evolving the treatment paradigm in Alzheimer's disease with an expected regulatory filing of LEQEMBI maintenance dosing. We would also expect regulatory filings for subcutaneous dosing which could facilitate at-home administration.\nSo in conclusion, through a combination of groundbreaking science, high potential near-term commercial opportunities and diligent capital allocation, I think Biogen is going to be well-positioned for the sustainable long-term growth. I'd like to now turn it over to Priya for an update on our progress in R&D.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nExecutive VP, Head of Development and Interim Head of Research, Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences\n\nThank you, Chris. Last quarter, we made important progress advancing key pipeline programs. As Chris just pointed out, we now have the opportunity to deliver 3 potential new drug launches across 4 indications this year, all in areas of high unmet need, including Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, postpartum depression and SOD1-ALS.\nWe also continue to evaluate potential opportunities for geographic and indication expansion for zuranolone as we work with our collaborator Sage to prepare for a potential U.S. launch later this year.\nI will share key highlights from the quarter across broader efforts in Alzheimer's disease with tofersen program in SOD1-ALS and the progress that we are making to rebalance the risk profile and improve productivity of the R&D pipeline.\nI will now share highlights of additional analyses Eisai recently presented or published, consistent with both companies' commitment to transparency. First, regarding activities of daily living, new analysis of ADCS-MCI-ADL presented at ADPD last month showed that all individual items of this scale favored LEQEMBI at 18 months as compared to placebo. This includes items like ability to make a [indiscernible] or keeping appointment. This result also made our CLARITY AD study outcome on the CDR Sum of Boxes where LEQEMBI treatment [ slowed ] decline across all 6 individual domains at 18 months versus placebo.\nAdditionally, results from CLARITY AD showed that at 18 months, LEQEMBI treatment resulted in a 50% less decline from baseline on scales designed to assess quality of life and reduced care partner burden as compared to placebo.\nIn addition was also presented an updated analysis of ARIA from the CLARITY AD study to evaluate ARIA incidents in LEQEMBI-treated participants on antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs as compared to LEQEMBI-treated participants that were not on either. The results were encouraging and showed that ARIA incidents were similar in the 2 groups.\nIn addition to the data presented at ADPD, newly published analyses from LEQEMBI Phase II study reinforce the finding that while [ plaques ] level begin to return slowly after treatment discontinuation, other biomarkers of AD biology such as plasma A-beta [ 42 to 40 ] ratio reaccumulate quickly. We believe these findings further support the potential benefit of continued treatment with LEQEMBI after plaques have been removed.\nBuilding on their prior work, Eisai published a new analysis of the long-term health outcomes associated with LEQEMBI treatment. Updated analysis incorporated data from the Phase III CLARITY AD study, replacing the prior modeling that used Phase IIb study results. The analysis of the Phase III data, consistent with the analysis of the prior Phase IIb study results, showed that LEQEMBI resulted in a delay of approximately 2 to 3 years in meantime to progression to mild, moderate and severe AD dementia versus standard of care alone. We believe these results build upon and reinforce the significant body of evidence that has been generated on LEQEMBI.\nBiogen is committed to building on its deep expertise and experience in Alzheimer's disease by advancing an industry-leading Alzheimer's pipeline that is diversified across therapeutic modalities and molecular targets. This includes focusing on tau. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangle, which represent a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's, are composed of [ hypophosphorylated ] tau protein.\nUnlike amyloid plaques, which are observed to build up in the brain years before the onset of cognitive symptoms, tau tangles are more closely related to the neuronal cell loss and onset of clinical symptoms. To address tau pathology, we are advancing BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau mRNA aiming to reduce all forms of tau protein. Importantly, this is a very different approach than utilizing a tau-directed antibody which is hypothesized to target only extracellular tau.\nWe were encouraged by the early results of this ASO-based approach as evidenced by the BIIB080 Phase Ib data in Alzheimer's disease which were presented last month at ADPD and also published in Nature Medicine, which went live online yesterday.\nPhase Ib data shown here on the slide. BIIB080 was generally well-tolerated. Majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, of which the most common were headache, back pain and post-lumbar puncture syndrome. We observed a time and dose-dependent reduction in CSF total and phospho-tau across the multiple ascending dose and long-term extension periods. Total tau continued to decline 16 weeks following the last dose in the MAD portion of the study, both in the high dose Q4 weekly and the Q12 weekly. And we saw a 50% reduction from baselines.\nWe observed that effect on neurofibrillary tangle, as visualized, via tau PET as early as 25 weeks across all brain regions assessed. Reduction in tau burden in all treatment groups at the end of the open-label extension at 100 weeks.\nThe BIIB080 study is the first to demonstrate this magnitude of tau PET reduction across brain regions. Encouraged by these early results, we continue to enroll the Phase II CELIA study of BIIB080 in early Alzheimer's disease, where we are exploring different dosing regimens, including every 12 weeks and every 24-week dosing.\nLast month, an advisory committee by the FDA met to review the tofersen data in SOD1-ALS. The advisory committee unanimously agreed that reduction in plasma neurofilament light is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit of tofersen for the treatment of SOD1-ALS. And they also reached a consensus that the benefit-risk profile was favorable.\nAs Chris mentioned, Biogen has spent years collaborating with the scientific community to characterize neurofilament as a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration, and we view the outcome of the advisory committee as a significant advancement for the field.\nWe believe these developments also inform our other programs in ALS, including BIIB105, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting ataxin-2 which may have therapeutic potential in the broader ALS population. BIB105 aims to reduce ataxin-2 protein levels, which we hypothesized will reduce toxic TDP-43 clusters that are observed in nearly all people living with ALS.\nPreclinical experiments confirm that reduction of ataxin-2 levels modified survival and function in a mouse model of TDP-43 ALS. The Phase I/II study of BIIB105 in ALS is expected to read out early next year.\nWe continue to advance our R&D prioritization efforts with the goals of optimizing the value that our pipeline can deliver. This includes investing in areas where we have a strong conviction in the disease biology. We continue to invest in further data generation for LEQEMBI and zuranolone and remain focused on executing key clinical studies, including BIIB080 and BIIB105 as well as for litifilimab in lupus. We also made a decision to opt in to Denali antibody transport vehicle A beta program. With the ATV A beta, we aim to safely increase [indiscernible] of A-beta antibody in the brain. This may enable improved plaque clearance and/or lower incidence of ARIA.\nWe are also deprioritizing programs based upon our integrated view of development, regulatory and on commercialization challenges. Recent updates include that we decided to terminate involvement in the development of BIIB093 in large hemispheric infarction and brain contusion due to operational challenges and strategic considerations.\nWe decided to pause initiation of the Phase IIb study of BIIB131 in acute ischemic stroke as we reassess whether we need to initiate the study.\nWe discontinued BIIB132 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.\nWe previously announced that we had refocused our investment in gene therapy, and we will continue to look to advance technology associated with the safe delivery of these therapies to the right targets in the body which we believe is one of the most critical scientific and technical challenges that is currently associated with this modality.\nWe also had previously announced that we exited ophthalmology research with goals of reallocating resources to areas where we believe there is a greater probability of success.\nThis will be an ongoing process, involving dynamic scientific prioritization and investment based on an ongoing assessment of probability of success, but we expect to complete our initial substantial review by midyear.\nIn conclusion, Biogen has had a significant number of accomplishments this past quarter, which we believe highlights the ability of our R&D organization to capitalize and deliver on groundbreaking science in the pursuit of new medicines for patients. With key assets in areas like Alzheimer's disease, depression, ALS and lupus, we believe the Biogen pipeline has the potential to deliver significant growth over the medium- and long-term.\nI will now pass the call over to Mike for the financial results.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Intelsat SA\n\nThank you, Priya. Good morning, everyone. So I'll provide some highlights of our financial performance for the first quarter, and please note that all financial comparisons that you will hear are versus the third quarter of 2022.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, and that's a decrease of 3% at actual currency and flat at constant currency.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $3.40, a decrease of 6%.\nTotal MS product revenue was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 19% at actual currency and 17% at constant currency. I'd like to provide a few points here regarding MS during the quarter. In the U.S., we continue to see the impact of TECFIDERA generics declines in the interferons and competition for TYSABRI. As we noted in our last call, Q1 is typically a seasonally weaker quarter for our MS business in the U.S., and that's driven by higher discounts and allowances and some channel dynamics. And as it relates to channel dynamics, we did see a greater-than-expected decrease in channel inventory which added a few percentage points to the overall global decline. And we believe this is likely related to tighter working capital management in wholesalers and specialty pharmacies, due to the rising interest rate environment.\nIn addition, VUMERITY is being impacted by both pricing pressure and a contraction of the oral segment of the market in the U.S. And as a reminder, in Q1 of last year, VUMERITY did benefit from a favorable Medicaid-related sales adjustment which also impacts the year-over-year comparison.\nAs far as Europe, as you know, we received a favorable decision relating to the TECFIDERA regulatory data and marketing protection in the EU, and that was assumed in our guidance. So we believe that TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory marketing protection in EU until at least February of 2024, and we are working to enforce this protection. I would add that we did expect it would take some time following the decision for all generic products to be off the market, and we are assuming that this exit will accelerate in the near-term. Separately, we continue to enforce our patent which expires in 2028.\nSo as we look toward the remainder of the year, we do expect to see a slower rate of decline on a year-over-year basis versus what we saw in Q1. We've taken some actions which aim to improve the underlying revenue trajectory for our MS portfolio in the second half, including for VUMERITY in the U.S., and we're continuing to closely monitor the underlying market dynamics in MS closely.\nMoving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $443 million was a decrease of 6% in actual currency and 2% at constant currency. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue decreased 10% due to fewer new patient starts and some channel dynamics as compared to the first quarter of last year. However, we do continue to see what we believe are signs of stabilization in our patient base.\nOutside the U.S., revenue for SPINRAZA decreased 4% at actual currency and increased 2% at constant currency with competition more than offset by the timing of shipments in certain markets.\nBiosimilars revenue was $192 million, and that's a decline of 1% at actual currency and an increase of 4% at constant currency, and that's due to volume growth driven by the launch of our BYOOVIZ product, partially offset by continued pricing pressure for our anti-TNF products in Europe.\nAlzheimer's disease revenue, which includes revenue from ADUHELM and the LEQEMBI collaboration equated to a headwind of $18 million to revenue. As a reminder, Beginning this quarter, our share of LEQEMBI commercial expenses in the U.S. is recorded as a component of revenue, thus the negative number this quarter. And for this line item, we expect this to continue to be negative in 2023 as ramping LEQEMBI commercialization expenses throughout the year are expected to exceed initial revenue.\nTotal anti-CD20 revenue of $399 million was flat. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 12%, which was partially offset by a 25% decline in revenue from our profit share on RITUXAN, and that was driven by biosimilar competition.\nThe anti-CD20 revenue line also included a $10 million operating loss related to LUNSUMIO. I'd note that our R&D expense for LUNSUMIO is also recorded as a component of the anti-CD20 revenue line.\nImportant to note that starting in the second quarter, our pretax profit share percentage on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO will decrease from 37.5% to 35%, and that [indiscernible] sales targets for GAZYVA as part of our contractual agreement with Genentech.\nContract manufacturing royalty and other revenue of $319 million benefited from the timing of production of some contract manufacturing batches which includes LEQEMBI. While this line tends to vary from quarter-to-quarter, we do not expect this level of contract manufacturing revenue to continue throughout the remainder of 2023.\nA couple of details regarding Q1 expenses. For the first quarter, non-GAAP cost of sales was $663 million or 27% of revenue. This includes $45 million of idle capacity charges which Eisai no longer shares.\nDuring Q1, we did see pressure on cost of sales associated with product mix. We saw increased contract manufacturing revenue which has a higher cost of sales including manufacturing revenue for LEQEMBI which is at minimal gross margin. We continue to expect our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of the year to be higher than the 22.4% that we saw for full year of 2022, and that's primarily as a result of product mix and idle capacity charges.\nFirst quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $571 million, and that compares to $552 million in the first quarter of last year. Non-GAAP SG&A was $603 million, and this compares to $635 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in non-GAAP SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives which importantly were partially offset by investments to support new product launches and $31 million related to the termination of the co-promotion agreement with Eisai to Biogen's MS products in Japan.\nWe continue to expect operating expenses to be lower in the second half of 2023 than in the first half. And as Chris mentioned, separate from the previously announced $1 billion cost savings initiative, we have initiated our Fit for Growth program in order to align our cost base with expected revenue while also investing in our growth opportunities. And we expect this program to have a modest impact on 2023 expenses and a more meaningful impact in 2024 and beyond, and we'll have more to say about this on our second quarter earnings call.\nAs for our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $6 billion in cash and marketable securities, $6.3 billion in debt and roughly $300 million in net debt. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received approximately $813 million related to the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis which is not included in these cash figures. And this payment is the second payment related to this transaction which closed around this time last year, and we're expecting a third payment of approximately $438 million in April of 2024.\nIn the first quarter, we generated $455 million in cash flow from operations. CapEx was $67 million. Free cash flow was $389 million. So overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to invest in growing the business over time.\nLet me now turn to financial guidance for full year 2023. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of a full year 2023 revenue decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range as compared to 2022 reported results and full year 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $15 and $16, and I would refer you to our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nSo in closing, Biogen continued to make strong progress against our business priorities in the first quarter. We remain focused on 3 potential launches in 2023 while continuing to be diligent in prioritizing our R&D pipeline, optimizing our operating model and also evaluating external opportunities. We expect that execution of these priorities will position us well for returning Biogen to sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, we will now open the call for questions.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Business Update. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference.\n\nMichael Hencke\n\nHead of IR, Biogen Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Biogen's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.\nWe believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nOn today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Michel.\n\nMichel Vounatsos\n\nCEO & Director, Biogen Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This is an exciting time for Biogen. In addition to key developments across our pipeline, which includes 12 programs in Phase III or filed, we continue to execute progress and we are pleased to be raising our full year financial guidance.\nI would like to begin by reviewing the important advances we made this quarter and what we believe they mean for Biogen. Priya will then review our recent progress in R&D and Mike will discuss our third quarter performance. First, together with Eisai, we were excited to announce the positive results from CLARITY AD, the Phase III study of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. For over 15 years, Biogen has been working relentlessly to bring forward new therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease, incorporating both new insights in disease biology and clinical trial design.\nAnd today, we celebrate the positive CLARITY AD readout as a significant achievement in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The results from Clarity AD illustrated several key aspects of lecanemab's clinical profile, which we believe could provide a meaningful benefit for patients. First, lecanemab administration showed a highly statistically significant reduction in clinical decline as early as 6 months, which expanded over the 18 months study period on an absolute basis, consistent with the disease-modifying effect.\nSecond, the study was positive on all key secondary endpoints. This includes measure of cognition as well as activities of daily living such as conducting personal finances, performing household tasks and independently traveling out of home. Third, the rate of ARIA within Clarity AD was within expectations. With an FDA decision on accelerated approval expected by January 6 of next year and Eisai's plan to file for traditional approval in the U.S., EU and Japan by the end of Q1 2023, lecanemab has the potential to be the first globally approved treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\nWe look forward to working with Eisai as they continue to engage both regulators and CMS with a goal of ensuring that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to important new treatments. We believe that Clarity AD results underscore the progress we are making in the fight against Alzheimer's. But Biogen will not stop here. We plan to build upon our current learnings as we continue to advance a diversified pipeline of potential Alzheimer's treatment. This includes 2 clinical-stage assets targeting tau pathology, BIIB080, our Phase II-ready antisense oligonucleotide and BIIB113, a Phase I small molecule.\nBeyond Alzheimer's Biogen has important opportunities in other therapeutic areas where the unmet medical need remains significant. This includes depression where, together with Sage, we are continuing to advance the regulatory filing for zuranolone in both major depressive disorders and postpartum depression. With a novel mechanism of action, efficacy observed as early as 3 days and a consistent safety and tolerability profile across 8 clinical studies, we believe that zuranolone, if approved, could be a meaningful new therapy for depression.\nSecond, the FDA has accepted our filing for tofersen in SOD1-ALS under the accelerated approval pathway and granted priority review. While the study did not meet the primary endpoint at 6 months, longer follow-up has shown that patients who remain on tofersen experienced a slow rate of decline in key clinical measures, including lung functions, muscle strength and quality of life. We are truly encouraged by these results in such a debilitating and fatal disease and look forward to an FDA decision expected by April of next year.\nWe believe this near-term opportunities, along with new launches of biosimilars, have the potential to drive renewed growth and position us to have 5 key franchises by 2025. Furthermore, we see the potential for additional growth drivers in the mid to late 2020s in areas such as Parkinson's disease, lupus and stroke, all with programs currently in Phase III. Overall, we believe that we are at an inflection point in CNS drug discovery and development. And these recent developments embody key advancements that are being made in neuroscience.\nFor years, Biogen has been expanding our expertise and capabilities in this area. And we believe that we are well positioned to remain a leader in neuroscience as we work to usher in the new next wave of CNS therapeutics while also advancing our portfolio in specialized immunology where we have 4 late-stage studies in lupus.\nI will now turn the call over to Priya for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nSenior VP, Head of Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences and Interim Head of Research & Development, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. As Michel mentioned, we had several exciting R&D achievements this past quarter that meaningfully advance the potential of our pipeline, which includes 30 programs, 12 of which are in Phase III or filed in order to deliver new impactful therapies for patients and drive renewed growth for the company.\nStarting with Alzheimer's disease. Together with Eisai, we were very excited to announce the positive results of the Clarity AD study, evaluating lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. The primary endpoint of the study was a change from baseline on CDR-Sum of Boxes, a well-established measure of cognition and function in Alzheimer's disease. The study met the primary endpoint and lecanemab reduced clinical decline on the CDR-Sum of Boxes compared with placebo at 18 months by 0.45, representing a treatment difference of 27%.\nWe also observed a highly statistically significant reduction in CDR-Sum of Boxes versus placebo as early as 6 months. We believe this demonstrates a rapid onset of efficacy and a significant change in CDR-Sum of Boxes versus placebo. Furthermore, the effect on CDR-Sum of Boxes expanded over the 18-month study period on an absolute basis, suggesting that lecanemab was exerting a disease-modifying effect.\nThe study also met all key secondary endpoints, reinforcing lecanemab's impact on cognition and function. This includes a statistically significant reduction in amyloid plaques in the brain as well as additional clinical assessments such as the ADCS-MCI-ADL, a caregiver-rated assessment of activities of daily living relative to placebo. We believe that these efficacy results, when combined with an observed overall incidence of ARIA of approximately 21%, highlights the potential for lecanemab to be a leading disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\nEisai will present the Clarity AD study results at CTAD in November and intends to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The lecanemab filing under the accelerated approval pathway is currently under review with a PDUFA date of January 6, 2023. The FDA has also agreed that the Clarity AD could serve as a confirmatory study to verify the clinical benefit of lecanemab. Accordingly, we expect Eisai will file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the U.S. as soon as possible, following a positive FDA decision on accelerated approval. This filing is expected by the end of Q1 2023, along with marketing authorization applications in the EU and Japan expected by the end of Q1 2023 as well.\nEisai has also been engaging with the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services as they work to maximize access for patients. Beyond these regulatory and access engagements, together with Eisai, we are also advancing a comprehensive development program for lecanemab, which includes, first, the ongoing AHEAD 3-45 preclinical study to evaluate lecanemab when administered earlier in disease, when amyloid pathology is present but before the onset of cognitive impairment.\nSecond, investigating a potential maintenance dosing regimen with the goal of reducing the lecanemab dosing frequency over time. And the development of a subcutaneous formulation of lecanemab. At AAIC earlier this year, Eisai presented bioavailability data from a Phase I study comparing IV versus subcutaneous dosing as well as modeling and simulation data illustrating that a fixed subcutaneous dose of 720 milligrams administered weekly may potentially result in comparable exposure and efficacy to the current IV formulation while potentially lowering the incidence of ARIA.\nWith these results in hand, we are focused now on maintaining our leadership position in Alzheimer's disease over the long term. We have an industry-leading portfolio addressing both amyloid and tau pathologies, as well as a multi-target, multi-modality preclinical portfolio targeting a broad range of Alzheimer's disease biology.\nNow I will turn to neuropsychiatry, where this quarter, Biogen and Sage presented new data that supports zuranolone's potential, if approved, as a novel treatment for both major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. This includes an updated analysis of the open-label ongoing longitudinal SHORELINE study in MDD, which showed that the medium time to onset first -- I'm sorry, the median time to first repeat treatment for patients who responded to the original 14-day treatment was 135 days for the 30-milligram cohort and 249 days for the 50-milligram cohort.\nWe believe these data further support zuranolone as a potential meaningful new treatment for people suffering from depression. And we are continuing to work with Sage to advance a single U.S. regulatory filing for zuranolone in MDD and PPD expected to be completed by the end of this year.\nMoving on to our neuromuscular portfolio. The New England Journal of Medicine recently published 12-month data from the Phase III VALOR study and its open-label extension evaluating tofersen in SOD1-ALS, a progressive and rare genetic form of ALS, which currently has no targeted therapy. The published data showed that patients who initiated tofersen in VALOR experienced slower rates of decline across critical measures of function, muscle strength and quality of life versus those who transitioned from placebo to tofersen at the start of the open label extension 6 months later.\nFurthermore, tofersen led to a robust and sustained reduction in neurofilament, a marker of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. In July, the tofersen filing was accepted by the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway with priority review. Subsequently, we submitted responses to information request by the FDA, which the FDA considered a major amendment to the application that will require additional time for review. As a result, the review period has been extended by 3 months with an FDA decision now expected by April 25, 2023.\nIn movement disorders, together with Denali, we initiated our second late-stage clinical trial for BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor. The Phase III LIGHTHOUSE study will evaluate BIIB122 in individuals with a confirmed pathogenic LRRK2 mutation. Given that LRRK2 activity is believed to regulate lysosomal function and underlying biological pathway implicated in Parkinson's disease, we are also advancing the Phase IIb LUMA study in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which we initiated earlier this year.\nMoving on to specialized immunology. We were excited to announce the initiation of the Phase II/III study of litifilimab or BIIB059 in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE. The prior Phase II LILAC study of litifilimab met the primary endpoints in both parts of the study, evaluating safety and efficacy in individuals with CLE and systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE. The detailed Phase II results were recently published as 2 separate manuscripts in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nThe Phase II/III study in CLE builds upon our mid- to late-stage pipeline in specialized immunology, which also includes 3 Phase III studies in SLE, 2 for litifilimab and 1 for dapirolizumab pegol, which we are developing in collaboration with UCB.\nLooking ahead, we also have a number of exciting opportunities on the horizon. This includes the potential to deliver new therapies in Alzheimer's, depression and SOD1-ALS, initiation of mid- to late-stage programs in Alzheimer's disease and stroke and a proof-of-concept study readout in broad ALS.\nIn conclusion, we believe that our recent progress exemplifies important elements of our broader approach to R&D at Biogen. This includes a focus on genetically validated targets and biology, the use of novel biomarkers to better characterize disease biology and target engagement, as well as our ability to employ the right therapeutic modality for the specific disease area or target.\nTogether, we believe these principles, combined with our ongoing prioritization effort, has the potential to increase the probability of success in disease areas with significant unmet need. I will now pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some highlights of our financial performance for the third quarter and an update to our full year 2022 guidance. Please note that all financial comparisons are versus the third quarter of 2021.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 10% at actual currency and 8% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter was $4.77, which was flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Total MS revenue, inclusive of OCREVUS royalties, was $1.6 billion, which was a decrease of 11% at actual currency and 9% at constant currency.\nGlobal TECFIDERA revenue of $339 million, decreased 32% at actual currency and 30% at constant currency. We saw continued erosion of TECFIDERA in the U.S. due to generics and an impact from generics outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany. We continue to see new generic launches in the EU. Earlier this month, the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice issued a nonbinding advisory opinion. We would expect TECFIDERA to have statutory market protection until at least February of 2024 if the court adopts the advisory opinion. There is no deadline for the court to issue its final decision, but we understand that approximately 3 to 5 months after issuance of the Advocate General's opinion is typical.\nSeparately, we are filing actions to enforce our recently granted European TECFIDERA dosing patent, which expires in 2028. We have been successful in obtaining preliminary injunctions in some countries and unsuccessful in others, including Germany and France. Until we either affirm TECFIDERA's entitlement to statutory market protection in the EU or successfully assert our patent, generics can continue to sell in the countries where we do not have preliminary injunctions in place.\nGlobal VUMERITY revenue of $138 million increased 14% at actual currency and 15% at constant currency. U.S. VUMERITY revenue increased 6% with higher volumes, partially offset by increased discounts and allowances. VUMERITY is being impacted by both payer pressure and a contraction of the oral segment of the market in the United States. We continue to work with our contract manufacturing supplier to address potential supply constraints for VUMERITY. We have identified the root cause, implemented manufacturing changes required to resolve the issue and are now working to secure necessary related regulatory approvals.\nWe do not anticipate a supply shortage in 2022 and are currently focused on rebuilding adequate inventory with the goal of assuring supply and reinitiating new country launches in 2023. Global TYSABRI revenue was $505 million, decreased 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. U.S. TYSABRI revenue was negatively impacted by higher discounts and allowances and lower volume. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to see continued patient growth as well as good uptake of the subcutaneous formulation in the EU which has now been launched in over 25 markets with an average conversion rate of approximately 40%.\nAlthough the composition of matter patents for TYSABRI have expired, we have other patents related to the making and using of TYSABRI, including those listed in our 10-K. We'll continue to enforce this IP, including filing suit against Sandoz in the United States. Global interferon revenue of $336 million, decreased 13% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency and was impacted by the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies.\nMoving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $431 million, declined 3% at actual currency and increased 2% at constant currency. In the United States, SPINRAZA revenue was flat versus the prior year and we believe we may be seeing signs of stabilization in the U.S. Outside the U.S., excluding negative currency impacts, revenue increased due to volume growth in certain Asian markets as well as some positive pricing dynamics, partially offset by competition and the timing of shipments. Overall, we continue to believe that SPINRAZA has the potential to grow over time.\nMoving to our Biosimilars business. Revenue of $188 million, declined 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. We saw an increase in sales volumes, which was offset by unfavorable pricing as well as negative currency impacts. We continue to expect a gradual launch of BYOOVIZ with more meaningful revenue contribution expected to begin in 2023.\nTotal anti-CD20 revenue of $417 million was flat versus the prior year. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 6%, which was offset by continued RITUXAN declines due to biosimilar competition.\nNow moving on to expenses in the balance sheet. Third quarter non-GAAP cost of sales was $470 million, which includes $12 million of idle capacity charges. Going forward, we expect further pressure on gross margins due to shifts in product mix and potential idle capacity charges largely resulting from the suspension of drug product manufacturing for ADUHELM. Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $549 million. This is compared to $702 million in the third quarter of 2021, which included approximately $165 million in upfront payments related to business development transactions as well as clinical trial closeout costs.\nNon-GAAP SG&A was $562 million. This is compared to $651 million in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven primarily by cost savings initiatives. Third quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $45 million, primarily driven by our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. Non-GAAP other expense was $55 million, primarily driven by interest expense.\nIn the third quarter, we generated $661 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $59 million and free cash flow was $602 million. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of the company's common stock during the quarter for $250 million at an average price of $214 per share. We ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, $6.3 billion in debt and approximately $500 million in net debt.\nOf note, in the third quarter, we received net proceeds of $583 million from the sale of one of our buildings in Cambridge as part of our office footprint optimization initiative. Additionally, in October, we paid $900 million plus fees and expenses to resolve the previously disclosed qui tam litigation. As a reminder, we expect to receive an additional $1.25 billion over the next 1.5 years from the sale of our equity stake in Samsung Bioepis, including approximately $813 million due in April of next year.\nOverall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity, including a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility to invest in growing the business over the long term. Before I turn to our updated guidance, let me say a few words about lecanemab. We are excited to be collaborating with Eisai on this important opportunity under a global 50-50 profit sharing agreement.\nAs a reminder, Biogen has the right to co-commercialize and co-promote lecanemab with Eisai, who has final decision-making authority. After approval, our share of profits or losses will be booked as a component of other revenue. The lecanemab component of other revenue may be negative in the initial quarters of the launch. Please see Slide 26 in our earnings presentation for other accounting considerations.\nLet me now discuss our updated full year 2022 guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance from our previous range of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion to a new range of $10 billion to $10.15 billion and increasing our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $15.25 to $16.75 to a new range of $16.50 to $17.15. This guidance increase is primarily a result of better-than-expected top line performance and continued cost management.\nOur guidance ranges for non-GAAP R&D expense, non-GAAP SG&A expense and our non-GAAP tax rate are all unchanged from prior guidance. As a reminder, we typically see a seasonally higher SG&A spend in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of September 30 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities. This financial guidance also assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition, as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue due to generic entry. Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nIn summary, we continue to execute well across our core business and are pleased to be raising our financial guidance for the year. We are excited about the recent lecanemab readout and believe our diversified pipeline across neuroscience, specialized immunology and biosimilars has the potential to return Biogen to growth over time as we continue to build a multifranchise portfolio.\nAs always, we remain focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, we will now open the call for questions.",

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Second Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference.\n\nMichael Hencke\n\nHead of IR, Biogen Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Biogen's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.\nWe believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs.\nThese statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nOn today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Michel.\n\nMichel Vounatsos\n\nCEO & Director, Biogen Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Biogen continued to execute well in the second quarter, and we are pleased to be raising our full year financial guidance. We believe our key achievements this quarter are critical steps on our path to drive renewed value creation for both patients and shareholders over time.\nFirst, together with Eisai, we are granted priority review for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. for early Alzheimer's disease. We expect an FDA decision by January 6 of next year. And in parallel, we look forward to the upcoming Phase III readout expected in the fall. Additionally, together with Sage, we reported positive data in postpartum depression.\nThe SKYLARK study is now the second positive Phase III study supporting the potential of zuranolone in PPD with four additional positive randomized controlled trials in major depressive disorders. We believe there is a substantial body of evidence supporting a significant opportunity for zuranolone.\nPursuit of innovation, however, does not come without setbacks, and we were disappointed to learn that the BIIB104 Phase II study in schizophrenia was not positive. I will now focus on the near-term operational priorities we outlined in our last call while Priya will review our recent progress in R&D, and Mike will discuss our second quarter performance.\nFirst, we are continuing to focus our R&D resources on programs where we see the greatest potential while also aiming to rebalance the risk profile across our pipeline. For example, we intend to accelerate the regulatory filing of zuranolone in postpartum depression following the positive SKYLARK study. In addition, we have terminated some R&D programs that we believe lower positive success such as BIIB076, an anti-tau antibody in Alzheimer's disease; and BIIB100, a small molecule XPO1 inhibitor in ALS.\nSecond, we are on track to implement the cost reduction and productivity measures outlined on our last call in order to further align our costs with our revenue base while maintaining our focus on execution. Third, we are pursuing additional global growth opportunities with a focus on key emerging markets. This includes China, where we are encouraged by the launch of SPINRAZA. Fourth, we are focused on driving renewed growth in our biosimilars business. We just recently launched BYOOVIZ, the first biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS in the U.S., representing Biogen's first entry into the U.S. biosimilars market. We also expect to begin launching BYOOVIZ outside the U.S. early next year.\nWith the completion of the sales of our joint venture interest in Samsung Bioepis in the second quarter, we now have an expanded ability to pursue the biosimilars business on our own, as we aim to bring more biosimilars products to more patients in more geographies. We continue to advance our biosimilars pipeline, which includes two Phase III programs referencing Eylea and ACTEMRA.\nFifth, we remain focused on capital allocation during the quarter. We entered into new collaborations with MedRhythms in MS and Alectos in Parkinson's disease, and we continue to evaluate both internal and excellent value creation opportunities. We also returned approximately $500 million to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases. We are also pleased with the progress in our collaboration with Genentech for mosunetuzumab, a CD20/CD3 bispecific antibody which was recently approved in the EU for patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\nThe BLA of mosunetuzumab for the same indication was recently granted priority review by the FDA, and we look forward to a potential approval in the U.S. Our progress across these areas in addition to the recent advancements we have made in R&D have the potential to help drive growth over time. Of course, we know that not all our programs will deliver the results we hope, which is why we are continuing to advance and build a diversified and appropriately balanced pipeline as we work to create and sustain a multi-franchise portfolio over time.\nThis includes near-term opportunities in Alzheimer's disease and depression followed by other areas such as Parkinson's disease, lupus and stroke in the mid- to late 2020s. We remain committed to taking advantage of all the strengths of the company: our talent, our commercial portfolio, our manufacturing capabilities, our pipeline, which includes 10 programs in Phase III or filed and our strong balance sheet to deliver results for both the patients we serve and our shareholders.\nI will now turn the call over to Priya for an update on our recent progress in R&D.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nSenior VP, Head of Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences and Interim Head of Research & Development, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking the Biogen team for their focus and dedication as we continued to advance a robust and diversified R&D pipeline. As Michel mentioned, we had several exciting R&D achievements this past quarter that I believe are key steps toward advancing our pursuit of meaningful new therapies for patients.\nStarting with Alzheimer's disease. As Michel mentioned, the FDA has accepted and granted priority review for the BLA for lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease under the accelerated approval pathway. Eisai is also continuing to progress the lecanemab Phase III Clarity study with an expected readout this fall. The Clarity AD study was designed to build upon the results of the prior Phase II study and utilizes clinically validated assessments designed to evaluate various aspects of cognition and function. Given the robust trial design, we believe that the totality of the Clarity AD results should allow us to further understand the effect of amyloid removal on different clinical domains of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe FDA has agreed that Clarity AD, when completed, can serve as a confirmatory study to verify the clinical benefit of lecanemab. Pending the results of the Clarity AD study, Eisai plans to file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the U.S., EU and Japan by the end of Q1 2023. This timing may allow for lecanemab, if approved, to become the first anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease with traditional approval.\nLast quarter, using simulation modeling based on the lecanemab Phase II results, Eisai also published an analysis estimating the potential long-term health outcomes of treatment with lecanemab. The results of this analysis suggests that compared to standard of care alone, individuals treated with lecanemab in addition to standard of care may potentially experience slower disease progression to mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease from baseline by 2.51, 3.13 and 2.34 years on average, respectively. These preliminary results could possibly translate into additional quality-adjusted life years and reduction in formal and informal cost of this disease. Beyond lecanemab, we continue to advance (inaudible) pipeline that is diversified across molecular targets and modalities. This includes BIIB080, our ASO targeting tau, where we expect to initiate a Phase II study later this year.\nMoving to neuropsychiatry. Together with Sage, we were very excited to announce positive results from the SKYLARK Phase III study of zuranolone in postpartum depression. The SKYLARK study met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with a 2-week course of 50 milligrams zuranolone, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms at day 15 as compared to placebo, the primary endpoint and at day 3, day 28 and 45. This is the second positive Phase III study of zuranolone in postpartum depression and further reinforces the clinical profile of zuranolone that has been observed to date.\nPostpartum depression is one of the most common medical complications occurring during and after pregnancy, affecting an estimated 1 in 8 mothers or approximately 500,000 women in the United States each year. Depression, sadness, anxiety, thoughts of hurting oneself or one's infant and thoughts of suicide are common signs associated with PPD. This is an area of significant unmet need where new treatment options are desperately needed.\nWith the SKYLARK study results now in hand, we are working with Sage to advance a single regulatory filing for zuranolone in MDD and PPD in the U.S., which we expect to complete in the second half of this year. Last quarter, Sage also presented the results of the zuranolone human abuse liability potential study at the College on Problems of Drug Dependence Annual Meeting. The results of this study showed that 30 and 60 milligrams of zuranolone demonstrated lower abuse potential as compared with alprazolam 1.5 milligrams and 3 milligrams in recreational users of CNS depressants. 90 milligrams of zuranolone was comparable to alprazolam 1.5 milligrams and 3 milligrams. As a reminder, the zuranolone doses studied in the MDD and PPD trials were between 20 to 50 milligrams.\nAlso in neuropsychiatry, we were disappointed to learn that the TALLY Phase II study of BIIB104 in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, or CIAS, did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Most adverse events in the BIIB104 treatment arms were mild to moderate in severity. Given the consistent lack of efficacy observed across the primary and secondary measures of cognition and functioning, while demonstrating expected drug exposure levels during the entire 12-week evaluation period, we have decided to discontinue the BIIB104 program in CIAS. We are continuing to analyze the data and plan to present detailed results at an upcoming scientific forum.\nMoving to our neuromuscular portfolio. Last month, we presented new 12-month data from the VALOR Phase III study and its open-label extension of tofersen in SOD1-ALS, a progressive and rare genetic form of ALS. This analysis was designed to evaluate participants who initiated tofersen during the 6-month placebo-controlled period in VALOR, versus individuals originally on placebo, who had a delayed start of tofersen treatment during the study's open-label extension. The results of the new 12-month analysis showed that initial -- earlier initiation of tofersen slowed decline across measures of clinical and respiratory function, strength and quality of life. Furthermore, tofersen led to robust and sustained reductions in neurofilament, a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration.\nWe believe that these results build upon the encouraging trends [of reduced] disease progression originally observed in the VALOR 6-month randomized study and further support the potential for tofersen to slow disease progression in SOD1-ALS. We continue to engage global regulators with these data, and we will provide updates when appropriate.\nIn movement disorders, we initiated the Phase IIb LUMA study in Parkinson's disease for BIIB122, a small molecule LRRK2 inhibitor that we are developing in collaboration with Denali Therapeutics. LRRK2 mutations result in hyperactivation of the kinase and are estimated to account for roughly 5% of familial and 2% of sporadic Parkinson's disease. By inhibiting LRRK2, BIIB122 is designed to target an underlying biological pathway implicated in Parkinson's disease, lysosomal function.\nFor this reason, we believe BIIB122 may have therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease more broadly, both in people with and without pathogenic LRRK2 mutations.\nThe LUMA study is designed to evaluate whether once-daily oral BIIB122 administration can slow clinical worsening versus placebo in Parkinson's disease patients without a pathogenic LRRK2 variant. We also anticipate initiating the Phase III LIGHTHOUSE study later this year designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIIB122 in Parkinson's disease patients with a confirmed LRRK2 pathogenic variant.\nThere are roughly 10 million people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide and no approved treatments set slow disease progression. By inhibiting LRRK2, we have the potential to deliver a first-in-class therapy that may significantly alter the course of disease.\nIn conclusion, we executed well against our R&D objectives in the second quarter and continue to prioritize our efforts across both therapeutic areas and programs. As Michel mentioned, we have already made several decisions resulting from this prioritization effort. And this is an ongoing process that will be driven by both scientific insights and internal inflection points.\nLooking toward the remainder of 2022, we anticipate several exciting milestones. These include the zuranolone regulatory filings for both MDD and PPD in the U.S., the Phase III readout of lecanemab in Alzheimer's disease and the initiation of mid- to late-stage studies in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and lupus. These are therapeutic areas characterized by significant unmet need and where Biogen has an opportunity to deliver first-in-class and best-in-class therapies to patients.\nI will now pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some highlights of our financial performance for the second quarter and update to our full year 2022 guidance. Please note that all financial comparisons are versus the second quarter of 2021, unless otherwise noted.\nTotal revenue for the second quarter was $2.6 billion, which was a decrease of 7% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter was $5.25, a decrease of 6%. Total MS revenue inclusive of OCREVUS royalties was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency.\nGlobal TECFIDERA revenue of $398 million decreased 18% at actual currency and 17% at constant currency. TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. increased versus the prior quarter. However, this was primarily due to channel dynamics and we do expect TECFIDERA in the U.S. to decline throughout the remainder of 2022. Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA was modestly impacted by generic competition in markets such as Canada and Germany.\nAt this point, we are aware of several generic applications that have been approved in Europe, and we will be monitoring the situation closely. Importantly, we were pleased to be granted a new patent in the EU and reserve all rights to assert the patent against infringing generics, but it is possible that generics may still launch at risk.\nGlobal VUMERITY revenue of $137 million increased 51% at actual currency and 52% at constant currency. VUMERITY continued to grow in the U.S. We are pleased with the trajectory. Outside the U.S., VUMERITY is now launched in 14 markets. We are currently working with our contract manufacturing suppliers to address potential supply constraints, and have therefore delayed any additional country launches.\nGlobal TYSABRI revenue of $516 million decreased 2% at actual currency and was flat at constant currency. In the United States, TYSABRI revenue was negatively impacted by modest volume declines, partially offset by favorable pricing. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to see continued patient growth. We are aware that regulatory filings for a biosimilar referencing TYSABRI have been submitted to both the FDA and the EMA. We will continue to enforce our IP, but a biosimilar could launch upon approval in the U.S. and EU, which could occur next year.\nGlobal Interferon revenue of $350 million decreased 13% at actual currency and 11% at constant currency and was impacted by the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high-efficacy therapies. Versus the prior quarter, Interferon revenue increased 13% at actual currency and 14% at constant currency, primarily due to seasonality and channel dynamics in the U.S.\nMoving to SMA. Global SPINRAZA revenue of $431 million declined 14% at actual currency and 11% at constant currency. In the U.S., we were encouraged to see fewer SPINRAZA discontinuations during the quarter. Outside the U.S., the revenue decline was primarily driven by competition, along with the timing of shipments in certain markets, pricing dynamics and negative currency impacts.\nGlobal SPINRAZA revenue decreased 9% versus the first quarter of 2022 at actual currency and 8% at constant currency, driven by competition and negative currency impacts outside the U.S. as well as some seasonality dynamics in the U.S.\nMoving to our biosimilars business. Revenue of $194 million declined 4% at actual currency and increased 3% at constant currency. Biosimilars volume increases were more than offset by negative currency impacts and pricing pressure. We continued to expect full year biosimilars revenue to decrease versus 2021.\nWe are pleased to have launched BYOOVIZ this quarter in the U.S., and we recorded some modest initial revenue due to channel stocking. As a reminder, we expect a gradual launch of BYOOVIZ, with more meaningful revenue contribution starting in 2023. Total anti-CD20 revenue of $436 million decreased 1%. Revenue from OCREVUS royalties increased 14%, which was more than offset by continued RITUXAN declines due to biosimilar competition.\nNow moving on to expenses and the balance sheet. Second quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million, including $18 million in upfront payments related to collaborations with MedRhythms and Alectos Therapeutics. This is compared to $585 million in the second quarter of 2021, which included approximately $50 million in upfront payments. Non-GAAP SG&A was $570 million, including approximately $29 million related to ADUHELM. This is compared to $635 million in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter collaboration profit sharing was a net expense of $29 million, which includes $58 million of net profit sharing expense related to the collaboration with Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by reimbursement of $29 million from Eisai related to the commercialization of ADUHELM in the U.S. Non-GAAP other expense was $79 million, primarily driven by interest expense. GAAP other income was $429 million, which included two items of note.\nFirst, we recorded an approximately $1.5 billion gain on the sale of our equity stake in the Samsung Bioepis joint venture. In addition, we recorded $900 million plus estimated fees and expenses related to an agreement in principle to resolve previously disclosed qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015. This agreement in principle does not include any admission of liability and is subject to the negotiation of final settlement agreements and documents. We expect to make the payment shortly after the agreements are finalized, which we expect to be as soon as possible and within the next 12 months.\nIn the second quarter, we generated $737 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $37 million and free cash flow was $700 million. We repurchased 2.4 million shares of the company's common stock during the quarter for $500 million. As of June 30, we ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $5.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $1.4 billion in net debt. In July, we repaid our senior notes due September 2022, with an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. Of note, as of June 30, we have capitalized approximately $71 million of work-in-process inventory related to lecanemab. We plan to continue building inventory over the coming months and we are also procuring raw materials associated with this production.\nIf the lecanemab Phase III study is negative or if lecanemab does not receive regulatory approval, we would expect to expense inventory on hand at that time as research and development expense subject to cost sharing with Eisai. Overall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity, including a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility to invest in growing the business over the long term.\nLet me now turn to our updated full year 2022 guidance. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance from our previous range of $9.7 billion to $10 billion to a new range of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion and increasing our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance from our previous range of $14.25 to $16 to a new range of $15.25 to $16.75. This guidance increase is primarily a result of better-than-expected top line performance and continued cost management. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of July 15 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities.\nImportantly, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance ranges despite some meaningful currency headwinds, which were not included in our guidance at the beginning of the year. Specifically, subsequent to issuing our most recent guidance on May 3, we have experienced a headwind of approximately $55 million to revenue and $0.20 to EPS due to currency fluctuations from April 29 through July 15. This is in addition to a headwind of approximately $120 million to revenue and $0.35 to EPS due to currency fluctuations between January 1 and April 29. These currency headwinds are primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact.\nThis financial guidance assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. Further, this guidance reflects a range of scenarios for the impact of TECFIDERA generics in the EU, which is difficult to predict. We are aware of a small number of generics that have launched to date, and we are monitoring the situation. We assume we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.3 billion throughout the remainder of the year. Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nIn summary, we continued to execute well across our core business and are pleased to be raising our financial guidance for the year. We remain focused on delivering results and are optimistic about the potential opportunities ahead of us that we believe can create long-term value for shareholders. We will now open the call for questions.",

My name is Cecilia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Business Update. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference.\n\nMichael Hencke\n\nHead of IR, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Biogen's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today.\nOur GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.\nI would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nOn today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Michel.\n\nMichel Vounatsos\n\nCEO & Director, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to execute on our core business objectives in the first quarter. Mike and Priya will review our quarterly performance and recent progress in R&D, while I focus on our strategy and near-term operational priorities.\nLet me start with a few comments on the recent national coverage determination by CMS for amyloid beta targeted therapies for Alzheimer's disease. This decision effectively denies all Medicare beneficiaries access to ADUHELM. We are very disappointed by the final NCD. And as a result, we will substantially eliminate our commercial infrastructure for ADUHELM. We will retain minimal resources to manage patient access programs, including a continued free drug program for patients currently on treatment in the U.S.\nWe expect to continue funding certain regulatory and R&D activities for ADUHELM, including the continuation of our EMBARK re-dosing study and the initiation of our Phase IV post-marketing requirement study, ENVISION. Additional actions regarding ADUHELM may be informed by upcoming data readouts expected for this class of antibodies as well as further engagement with the FDA and CMS.\nIn parallel, we are committed to working closely with Eisai on the potential launch of lecanemab. We are now looking forward as we work to advance our broader pipeline, including lecanemab and zuranolone, execute on our base business and deploy our capital in the best interest of shareholders. We recognize that Biogen is facing a number of near-term challenges. These challenges, including generic erosion of TECFIDERA, competition for SPINRAZA in biosimilars (inaudible) and a declining profit share from RITUXAN in the U.S.\nThese challenges are all part of the biopharmaceutical business lifecycle, and we believe that potential new product launches such as lecanemab, zuranolone and additional biosimilars can help return the company to grow over time. Further, we see the potential for additional growth driver in the mid- to late 2020s in other areas such as stroke, lupus and Parkinson's disease. And of course, we will be pursuing new business development opportunities as well. However, given that we are in a long product cycle business and in light of the CMS decision, we recognize there is more we must do today to provide better clarity and visibility into the company's future.\nLet me share the priority actions we are implementing now. First, we are increasing our focus on R&D prioritization with the goal of maximizing the probability of success, which Priya will further discuss. This prioritization process will be informed in part by key data readouts expected in 2022. In Alzheimer's disease, together with Eisai, we plan to complete the rolling submission for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. during the second quarter of this year. In addition, we expect a readout of the Phase III Clarity AD confirmatory trial for lecanemab this fall.\nBased on the results of the study, we plan to submit for full FDA approval by the first quarter of 2023 with the opportunity for lecanemab to become the first anti-amyloid antibody to obtain full approval for Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. In neuropsychiatry, we are working with Sage to advance zuranolone as an important new potential option for MDD and PPD. We recently initiated the rolling submission of zuranolone in MDD and expect to complete the filing in the second half of 2022.\nWe also look forward to the Phase III SKYLARK study readout in PPD, expected mid this year with an associated filing for PPD anticipated early next year. Also in neuropsychiatry, we expect the Phase II readout for BIIB104 in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia in mid-2022. Second, we will implement additional cost reduction and productivity measures above and beyond our previously communicated initiatives to further align our costs with our revenue base. These measures will include the substantial elimination of our commercial infrastructure supporting ADUHELM as well as other cost reduction while we continue to fund promising pipeline and commercial opportunities.\nThird, we are executing on international growth opportunities with a focus on key emerging markets, such as China and certain markets in both Latin America and the Middle East. This includes the continued launch of SPINRAZA and may also include pursuing local business development opportunities. Fourth, we plan to drive renewed growth in our biosimilars business, although our portfolio of anti-TNF products is likely past the peak of its lifecycle. We currently have 4 more programs in development, and in the near term, we are preparing to launch BYOOVIZ, referencing Lucentis in the U.S. in the coming months.\nOur fifth near-term priority is capital allocation. Biogen is fortunate to have a strong balance sheet with $4.8 billion in cash as of the end of the quarter and modest net debt, as well as strong cash flow generation. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus the deployment of cash towards initiatives designed to create incremental revenue growth opportunities, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases.\nIn summary, the challenges faced by the company over the last -- the past 12 months have been significant. We are committed to taking advantage of all the strengths we have, including our talent, our commercial portfolio, our manufacturing capabilities, our pipeline, which includes 10 programs in Phase III or filed and of course, our strong balance sheet to deliver on the performance that is expected from us.\nLet me conclude by saying that it has been an honor to lead this outstanding company during such a challenging period of time and to work closely with so many dedicated and talented colleagues. I am very proud of all that we have achieved. I want to thank the Board of Directors and my colleagues for their support during this period. I will be leaving at a time of promise for Biogen with noteworthy potential for value creation, and I look forward working with my successor through a smooth transition.\nI will now turn the call over to Priya for an update on our recent progress in R&D.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nSenior VP, Head of Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences and Interim Head of Research & Development, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. As Michel mentioned, we are enhancing our focus on dynamic R&D prioritization with the goal of ensuring a sustainable pipeline that can deliver on Biogen's vision of a multi-franchise portfolio. We will continue to invest in R&D in a disciplined manner, including pursuing new and external opportunities with a potentially different risk/reward profile encompassing those within our core neuroscience therapeutic areas as well as select investments in therapeutic adjacencies.\nThis approach will be informed by emerging scientific data, as well as internal and external readouts. As part of our overall prioritization strategy, we may choose to accelerate, terminate, divest or partner certain programs. In addition, we will continue to advance key capabilities such as functional genomics, patient identification, novel modalities, biomarkers and clinical outcome measures. The goal being to reduce risk, accelerate clinical development and increase the probability of success in achieving positive proof of concept.\nI will now share the R&D highlights of the quarter. Starting with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to continuing the progress with lecanemab U.S. filing and the Phase III study, Eisai presented data at the annual AD/PD meeting this past March showing that lecanemab treatment in the core Phase IIb study resulted in a dose and time-dependent reduction of brain amyloid as measured by PET SUVR and that the reduction of brain amyloid was co-related with changes in 2 important peripheral biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology, specifically an increase in plasma Abeta 42/40 ratio and a decrease in plasma phospho-tau 181, respectively.\nFurthermore, these biomarker changes were correlated with clinical benefit as assessed by the change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes. Notably, however, these peripheral biomarkers gradually began to reverse upon discontinuation of lecanemab treatment at the end of the core study, suggesting that stopping dosing prematurely may allow re-accumulation of Alzheimer's disease pathology.\nEisai also presented additional information on ARIA from the lecanemab Phase IIb study. This included the incidence of ARIA-E in the open-label extension where ARIA-E was observed in less than 10% of participants receiving 10-milligram per kg lecanemab biweekly and a symptomatic ARIA rate of less than 2%, consistent with the core study. We look forward to further defining the safety and efficacy of lecanemab through the larger Phase III Clarity AD study.\nBiogen and Eisai are currently evaluating subcutaneous dosing in a substudy of the Clarity AD open-label extension, which will evaluate subcutaneous injections compared to IV infusions. This is in addition to the ongoing AHEAD 3-45 study evaluating lecanemab in people with preclinical Alzheimer's disease or prior to cognitive impairment, which was initiated back in 2020.\nBeyond lecanemab, Biogen continues to pursue new treatments across molecular targets in Alzheimer's disease. This includes actively planning for the Phase II study of BIIB080, our tau ASO, and initiation of dosing in the Phase I study of BIIB113. BIIB113 is a small molecule inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase or OGA, an enzyme believed to catalyze the removal of (inaudible) post-translational modification of the tau protein. By inhibiting OGA, we aim to increase the (inaudible) of tau to potentially inhibit tau aggregation and thereby slow clinical decline.\nAs Michel mentioned, with aducanumab, we are also continuing to collect data in our EMBARK re-dosing study and working towards the initiation of ADUHELM Phase IV post-marketing requirement study, ENVISION.\nMoving to neuropsychiatry. Biogen and Sage recently announced that we initiated the rolling submission of a new drug application to the FDA for zuranolone in MDD. We expect to complete the filing in the second half of this year. We were also excited to announce that the zuranolone Phase III CORAL study in major depressive disorder met the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint. The CORAL study was a randomized blinded trial designed to assess rapidity of response when zuranolone 50 milligrams is co-initiated with an open-label standard of care antidepressant or ADT versus placebo co-initiated with ADT, as measured by the change from baseline on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.\nTop line results showed that zuranolone co-initiated with ADT resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms at day 3, the primary endpoint and the earliest time point measured, as well as over the full 2-week treatment period as compared to placebo co-initiated with ADT. Zuranolone was generally well tolerated with most treatment-emergent adverse events reported as mild or moderate. In MDD, zuranolone has now delivered 4 positive randomized controlled trials in total, as well as important insights on repeat treatment from the SHORELINE study, a large prospective naturalistic study in MDD. While these trials were designed to address different questions, we see a consistent profile of zuranolone that includes rapid reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the standard of care antidepressants, a consistent tolerability profile with a low discontinuation rate due to adverse events and without observed weight gain, sexual dysfunction or suicidal ideation; a short course of treatment that can be potentially taken as needed; and a flexible treatment approach that may provide optionality to HCPs and patients.\nThis is in addition to positive data from the Phase III ROBIN study of zuranolone in postpartum depression. We look forward to the Phase III SKYLARK study readout in PPD expected by midyear with an associated filing for PPD anticipated early next year. We look forward to potentially bringing a rapid onset, well-tolerated oral antidepressant with sustained effects and a new mechanism of action to patients suffering from depression.\nMoving to ALS. We previously reported that while the Phase III VALOR study for tofersen in SOD1-ALS, a rare genetic form of ALS, did not achieve the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change on the ALSFRS-R at week 28 versus placebo. We did observe signs of reduced disease progression across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints. We plan to present integrated data from the Phase III VALOR study and a new interim analysis of its ongoing open-label extension at the upcoming ENCALS meeting in June.\nThis interim analysis includes data from participants with SOD1-ALS, who had the opportunity for at least 1 year of follow-up from the start of VALOR. Long-term data on measures of function, strength, quality of life and survival will be presented. We also continue to recruit for ATLAS, a study evaluating tofersen in presymptomatic participants with a confirmed SOD1 mutation, while also supporting the global tofersen expanded access program, which includes approximately 120 people with SOD1-ALS to date from more than a dozen countries.\nWe also remain engaged with regulators on potential next steps for tofersen. As you can see, 2022 is an important year for Biogen R&D with several important milestones expected as we continue to advance a diversified pipeline that contains a total of 32 clinical programs with 10 programs in either Phase III or being filed. These milestones include key regulatory filings, mid- to late-stage readouts in both Alzheimer's disease and neuropsychiatry, initiation of late-stage studies in Parkinson's disease, and starting a pivotal study in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, in addition to ongoing recruitment for 2 Phase III lupus programs in SLE, as well as planning next steps for the BIIB131 stroke program.\nIn summary, we are taking actions that we believe will enable delivery of a number of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules to patients suffering from diseases with significant unmet need. I will now pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some key highlights around the financial performance for the quarter and review our full year 2022 guidance. Please note that all financial comparisons are versus the prior year, unless otherwise noted.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter was $2.5 billion. Our MS business inclusive of OCREVUS Royalties delivered $1.6 billion in revenue. TECFIDERA continues to be impacted by generic entry in the U.S. and was negatively impacted by pricing pressure outside of the U.S. VUMERITY first quarter global revenue was $128 million. We are pleased with VUMERITY's trajectory in the U.S. and are making good progress towards launching in up to 20 markets outside the U.S. this year.\nTYSABRI global revenue increased 3%. In the U.S., TYSABRI revenue benefited from favorable pricing that more than offset modest volume declines. Outside the U.S., we were pleased to see continued patient growth. Interferon global revenue declined by 23% due to the continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies.\nMoving now to SMA. SPINRAZA global revenue declined 9%. In the U.S., although revenue growth of 10% was driven by positive channel dynamics, we were encouraged to see new patient starts at the highest levels in over 2 years and a continued slowdown of discontinuations versus the prior quarter. Outside the U.S., the revenue decline was driven primarily by the timing of shipments in certain markets, competition and negative currency impacts, partially offset by strong initial uptake in China as this was the first full quarter since receiving national reimbursement in China. Global SPINRAZA revenue grew 7% versus Q4 of 2021, driven by solid sequential performance outside the U.S. as well as some seasonality dynamics in the U.S.\nMoving to our biosimilars business, revenue declined 5%, while volume increased, this was more than offset by pricing pressure and negative currency impacts. In April, we completed the transaction to sell our equity stake in our biosimilar joint venture. As a reminder, the economics for anti-TNF and ophthalmology programs will be substantially unchanged. In addition, we are preparing to launch BYOOVIZ in the U.S. in the coming months.\nWe expect a gradual launch with more meaningful revenue contribution starting in 2023. Overall, we expect full year biosimilars revenue to decrease versus the prior year due to pricing pressure in Europe. Total anti-CD20 revenue grew 3% with increased OCREVUS Royalties being partially offset by a continued decline in RITUXAN revenues due to biosimilar competition.\nFirst quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by a $275 million charge for ADUHELM inventory write-offs as well as approximately $45 million of idle capacity charges. Note that Eisai's share of these charges is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line.\nMoving now to expenses and the balance sheet. Q1 non-GAAP R&D expense was $552 million. Non-GAAP SG&A was $635 million, including approximately $80 million related to ADUHELM. Eisai's share of these costs are also reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. First quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $117 million, which includes reimbursement of approximately $182 million from Eisai, partially offset by $64 million of net profit-sharing expense related to our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis.\nIn the first quarter, we generated approximately $162 million in cash flow from operations, which was negatively impacted by the timing of certain payments. Capital expenditures were $58 million and free cash flow was approximately $104 million. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in debt, $4.8 billion in cash and marketable securities and $2.5 billion in net debt. We subsequently also received approximately $1 billion from the sale of our JV equity to Samsung Biologics. Additionally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the quarter.\nOverall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to invest in growing the business over the long term. Let me now turn to our updated full year guidance for 2022. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $9.7 billion to $10 billion. This revenue guidance reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar from January 1 through April 29, resulting in an estimated currency headwind of approximately $120 million, net of hedging activities. We are also reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $14.25 to $16 despite the $0.76 impact of ADUHELM inventory write-offs as well as an impact of approximately $0.35 related to the strengthening of the dollar that I just mentioned. Although our prior guidance did not assume either the inventory write-offs or the currency headwinds, we believe the additional cost measures announced today as well as better performance in our base business can largely offset these impacts. This financial guidance assumes continued declines in RITUXAN revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. This guidance also continues to assume the potential entry of TECFIDERA generics in the EU in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe expect to decrease revenue from these high-margin products as well as the ADUHELM inventory charges to reduce our gross margin percentage when compared with 2021. This guidance reflects the initial implementation of the additional cost reduction and productivity measures, which Michel discussed. These additional measures are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings in addition to the previously communicated initiatives already targeting approximately $500 million in annualized savings.\nThis brings total expected annualized savings to approximately $1 billion, a portion of which will be reinvested in strategic initiatives over the coming years. We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. Non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, which is a decrease from prior guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which is due to the additional cost reduction measures just mentioned, which we expect to primarily impact the third and fourth quarters.\nThis guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of April 29 will remain in effect for the remainder of the year, net of hedging activities and does not contemplate any further strengthening or weakening of the dollar throughout the year. We assume that we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion throughout the year. Please see our press release for other important guidance assumptions.\nSo in summary, we continue to execute on our core business objectives this quarter and are now focused on a set of near-term operational priorities, which we believe can drive value creation over time. We'll now open the call for questions.",

My name is Madison, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Financial Update. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Hencke, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Hencke, you may begin your conference.\n\nMichael Hencke\n\nHead of IR, Biogen Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Biogen's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the earnings release and related financial tables, including our GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today.\nOur GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2, and Table 4 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally. We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.\nI would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.\nToday, we will be discussing ADUHELM. ADUHELM is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with ADUHELM should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease that were studied. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with ADUHELM. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial or trials.\nADUHELM can cause serious side effects, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but can be serious. ADUHELM can cause serious allergic reactions. The most common side effects include ARIA, headache and fall. Please see full prescribing information and patient medication guide at aduhelm.com.\nOn today's call, I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Michel Vounatsos; Dr. Priya Singhal, Interim Head of Research and Development; and our CFO, Mike McDonnell. We will also be joined for the Q&A portion of our call by Alisha Alaimo, President of our U.S. organization. As a reminder, during the Q&A portion of the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. I will now turn the call over to Michel.\n\nMichel Vounatsos\n\nCEO & Director, Biogen Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will start by briefly reviewing our financial performance, and Mike will provide more details. For the fourth quarter, Biogen generated approximately $2.7 billion in revenue, representing a decrease of 4% year-over-year as we continued to experience the erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to the impact of generic entry.\nFourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings were $3.39 a share. We believe this performance reinforces Biogen's ability to execute well. However, given a number of challenges we have faced recently, we announced that we will implement cost reduction measures, which are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings, and Mike will provide additional details.\nLet me now say a few words regarding the proposed National Coverage Determination, or NCD, for the class of monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As currently written, the proposed NCD calls for coverage with evidence development or ECED, which will provide reimbursement only for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an approved randomized controlled trial.\nIn reaching this proposed recommendation, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, highlighted 3 key areas of focus for this class of therapies, all of which have implications for ADUHELM. First, CMS believes there are gaps in the data and the clinical benefit of these therapies. Second, CMS believes more information is needed about the potential risks of removing amyloid principally area. And third, CMS would like additional data to be generated on the underrepresented communities in which Alzheimer's disease is more prevalent. These are also areas of focus for Biogen with many important initiatives already underway.\nWe have committed to constructive engagement with CMS to address their concerns, and we agree with CMS that additional data may be helpful to continue to characterize the benefit risk profile for this class of therapies. Now that ADUHELM is approved by the FDA, we believe the most helpful data generation can really only be generated from greater drug utilization in real-world practice. We also agree with CMS that the final NCD decision should not lead to a duplication of ongoing activities.\nAs currently postured, however, we believe the proposed CD requirements will be prohibitive for patients, overly burdensome, costly to companies and duplicative of the data that will be generated from ongoing trials and the FDA's existing required post-marketing requirements. We believe the best way to address the concerns of CMS is to supplement the data from the ADUHELM Phase III studies. We generated data over 3,000 patients by taking a multipronged approach, leveraging the Phase IV inflammatory study and vision; our EMBARK redosing study, which has enrolled approximately 1,700 patients; the ongoing ICARE AD registry; the ongoing Phase III studies of other antibodies in the class; and other ongoing and anticipated real world data generation efforts.\nWe believe this extensive data generation opportunity will adequately address any open questions regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of amyloid beta luring therapies. On this note, we expect to begin patient screening for the ENVISION study in May of this year with the primary completion date anticipated approximately 4 years later. This is expected to be a global placebo-controlled trial aiming to enroll 1,500 patients with MCI due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's disease with confirmation of amyloid beta pathology.\nThe planned endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes at 18 months with a planned long-term extension for up to 48 months. We believe this study, combined with the other studies I mentioned, should address the questions raised by CMS. Therefore, we will continue to advocate for an NCD that provides rapid and equitable patient access by providing coverage only for the patients identified as most appropriate for treatment in our FDA-approved label, which generally aligns to our Phase III clinical trial population.\nWe also believe this multipronged approach will allow for more equal access in all communities. We have concerns that the restrictions of the proposed CD would unfairly exclude access for patients in other self communities and geographically remote areas. In contrast, we expect both Envision and our ICARE AD registry, which seeks to enroll up to 6,000 participants to obtain more representative data from those communities by aiming to enroll 16% to 18% of U.S. participants from Black and Hispanic population.\nIn summary, we will advocate for a final CD that tracks a better balance between patient access for an FDA-approved therapy today and the desire for additional data that can only be gathered over time and with higher levels of drug utilization in the real world. We look forward to discussing this consideration and working towards a final decision that is in the best interest of patients.\nBeyond the NCD last quarter, we presented additional data from the ADUHELM Phase III clinical trial showing the effect on downstream Alzheimer's biology and the correlation between plasma P-cell reduction and less cognitive and functional decline. In addition, we published the Phase III ARIA findings in JAMA Neurology.\nAs we look forward, we aim to expand both within and beyond neuroscience with a focus on 4 pillars to drive growth and value creation. First, we intend as a company to build on our strong foundation in neuroscience, where we currently have 26 programs in clinical development. Second, we have what we believe to be 2 compelling Phase III programs in lupus. This is a therapeutic area with a different risk profile, and we are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities in specialized immunology.\nThird, over the last several years, we have also built a very successful new business with our biosimilars. We recently announced an agreement to sell our stake in the Samsung Bioepis joint venture to Samsung Biologics with Biogen remaining in our current role as the commercialization partner for the Samsung Bioepis anti-TNF portfolio and ophthalmology programs.\nWe currently anticipate that this transaction will close in mid-2022. Once closed, going forward, we will have an expanded ability to pursue the biosimilars business on our own as we aim to bring more biosimilar products to more patients in more geographies. Mike will provide more details.\nAnd lastly, we are also focused on accelerating our efforts in digital health to support our commercial and pipeline programs while also creating opportunities for potential digital therapeutics. To this point, we have built a dedicated digital health portfolio, which includes the recently announced new collaboration with Terra Panacea with the aim of leveraging our significant database, but also machine learning, artificial intelligence to develop digital health solution that may improve patient care, accelerate drug development and further the understanding of underlying pathologies.\nOur progress across these 4 pillars provides us with the potential for 2 future waves of growth as we launch in new therapeutic areas and build new franchises. First, over the next few years, we believe we have a significant potential in Alzheimer's disease and depression, 2 large therapeutic areas with significant unmet needs. In Alzheimer's disease, we have a deep pipeline of clinical and preclinical assets, leveraging multiple modalities and targets, including both amyloid and tau with ADUHELM and lecanemab, Biogen and SI have 2 out of the 4 potential anti-amyloid antibody therapies that are either approved or in late-stage development.\nIn depression, we are collaborating with Sage Therapeutics on (inaudible), which we believe has the potential to provide a valuable new option for patients suffering from major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. We believe our second future waves of growth anticipated in the mid to late 2020s will be driven by a number of diverse therapeutic areas, including stroke, Parkinson's Disease and lupus with some of these programs already in Phase III. These anticipated future waves of growth will be supported by our diversified pipeline, which today includes 32 clinical programs, 10 of which are in Phase III or filed.\nAdditionally, outside of our core business, we are pleased to have recently exercised an option for mosunetuzumab, a late-stage investigational bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3 in development by Genentech for oncology and potentially other indication. Exercise of this option will provide Biogen with a profit share, while Genentech will lead strategy and implementation with an expected FDA filing in the near future.\nThis builds on Biogen and Genentech's long history of productive collaboration, which began with rituximab. Our focus in 2022 will remain on execution and agility as we expect a number of important milestones. This includes the continued launch of ADUHELM in the U.S., the launch of VUMERITY in the EU and our expected entry into the U.S. biosimilars market with Bioepis. We expect 5 data readouts, 3 of which are in Phase III; and the completion of 3 regulatory filings in Alzheimer's disease, depression and biosimilars.\nBefore I turn the call over to Priya for an update on our progress in R&D, I want to first say how impressed I am by what I have seen from Priya, both as the Head of Safety and Regulatory Science and most recently as our acting head of R&D. Her ability to lead, strategic thinking and her subject matter expertise gives me the utmost confidence in our ability to advance our pipeline while we work to name a permanent successor. Please go ahead, Priya.\n\nPriya Singhal\n\nSenior VP, Head of Global Safety & Regulatory Sciences and Interim Head of Research & Development, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to say what an honor it is to serve as Acting Head of R&D at Biogen. Biogen has a track record in developing life-changing therapies in MS and SMA.\nWith a deep and diverse R&D pipeline, Biogen aims to bring impactful medicines to patients suffering from neurological and immunological diseases characterized by significant unmet need. As this is my first earnings call within this role, I would like to review a few areas that I'm especially excited about.\nFirst, we believe that Biogen has a unique opportunity to lead in Alzheimer's disease, not only because we are advancing an industry-leading Alzheimer's pipeline, but also because of the proactive focus we have placed on continued data generation for aducanumab. This includes Envision, the planned post-marketing Phase IV study, the ongoing EMBARK redosing study and obtaining real-world data through the ICARE AD registry.\nWe believe data from patients treated with aducanumab in the real-world settings with greater drug utilization is the best way to complement the extensive clinical data generated on aducanumab to date in addition to the ongoing and planned clinical trials. We also continue to gain potential insights from the aducanumab Phase III clinical data regarding Alzheimer's disease biology and the treatment effect of aducanumab.\nOn this particular point, Biogen recently presented additional data from the ENGAGE and EMERGE Phase III trials at the annual CTAD meeting last November. The important analysis of this data showed that in addition to reducing amyloid blocks in the brain, aducanumab treatment also resulted in changes in downstream tau Alzheimer's disease biology specifically soluble hospital or PTL, as seen in both CSF and plasma.\nIn this analysis, we evaluated over 7,000 plasma samples from more than 1,800 subjects from the EMERGE and ENGAGE Phase III trials to investigate the effect of aducanumab treatment on plasma PTA 181. The results showed a time and dose-dependent reduction in PTA 181 over 78 weeks with aducanumab treatment in both Phase III trials. The reduction in plasma PTA 181 from baseline to week 78 in this analysis was significantly correlated with change in amyloid PET over the same time period and was also significantly associated with less clinical decline across all primary and secondary outcome measures, assessing cognition and function in both studies.\nThese findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aggregated forms of amyloid may mediate soluble tau force cortilation. With regard to our AD pipeline, we are excited about lucanumab, our other anti-amyloid antibody in Alzheimer's disease that is being developed in collaboration with Eisai.\nIn Phase II, lucanumab did not utilize a titration period, demonstrated rapid and robust reduction of amyloid blocks and showed an ARIA incidence of around 10%. We look forward to the Phase III readout expected in the second half of this year. Beyond our programs targeting amyloid, we are also pursuing a multi-modality approach focused on other targets in Alzheimer's.\nFirst, we have BIIB080, which is an ASO that we believe facilitates tau mRNA degradation and has demonstrated both a time and dose-dependent reduction of CSF phospho and total tau in Phase I. We anticipate starting the Phase II study of BIIB080 by midyear.\nSecond, we are also planning for the near-term initiation of a Phase I study for BIIB113, a small molecule inhibitor of Oglicnakase or OGA, an enzyme believed to catalyze the removal of oglic post-translational modification of tau protein. Evidence suggests that oglignulation of tow attenuates aggregation. By inhibiting OGA, we aim to increase the oglignulation of tau to potentially inhibit to aggregation and thereby slow clinical decline.\nHaving developed the first FDA-approved therapy to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's, we believe that Biogen is uniquely positioned with the right expertise, experience and access to modalities to lead in Alzheimer's disease. This is a complex disease requiring a multifaceted approach and continued investment as we work to build on the scientific learnings of ADUHELM and develop the next wave of potential Alzheimer's therapies.\nI would now like to talk about depression. I believe that zuranolone with a novel mechanism of action may provide an important new treatment option for patients suffering from major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. The reported clinical data generated to date from multiple clinical trials showed the following: first, in earlier studies, an improvement in depressive symptoms has been observed as early as day 3. Second, zuranolone has displayed a consistent safety and tolerability profile with no observed evidence of weight gain, sexual dysfunction, euphoria or increased suicidal ideation. Third, the SHORELINE Phase III open-label study showed that approximately 80% of patients who responded to the initial course of 50 milligrams of zuranolone needed at most 1 additional treatment total during their time in the 1-year study. Fourth, in the WATERFALL Phase III study, zuranalone reduced depressive symptoms in patients suffering from MDD both with and without elevated anxiety. Fifth, zuranolone has shown improvements in depressive symptoms in postpartum depression. For zuranolone, we look forward to 2 Phase III readouts this year, the CORAL study in MDD and the SKY LOCK study in PPD.\nThe next area I would like to highlight is stroke. Last year, we were excited by the results from the Phase II study of BIIB131, formerly known as TMS-007 in acute ischemic stroke. Administration of the current standard of care, pharmacological thrombolytic TPA, is limited to a short therapeutic window within 4.5 hours following the acute onset of stroke symptoms. This short time window is meant to mitigate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, which is the most concerning adverse event associated with PPA.\nIn the Phase IIa study of BIIB131, acute stroke patients were randomized to receive BIIB131 or placebo out to 12 hours from their last known normal. The primary objective of the study was safety. And of the 52 patients who received BIIB131, non-experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage compared to 1 out of the 38 patients who received placebo. This was despite an extended treatment window where patients, on average, received BIIB131 at 9.5 hours after the onset of acute stroke symptoms.\nAdditionally, BIIB131 showed a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the modified Rankin Scale, or MRS, a registrational endpoint of functional independence. Furthermore, the rate of recanalization or improvement of vessel blood flow in patients who had a visible vessel occlusion was approximately 58% at 24 hours,in those who had received BIIB131 as compared to 27% of patients who received placebo.\nWe believe BIIB131 may have the potential to be a best-in-class thrombolytic for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by extending the time -- treatment time window out to 24 hours with an appropriate efficacy and safety profile. We are currently evaluating the next steps in the development for BIIB131.\nIn addition to BIIB131, we also continue to advance a Phase III study for BIIB093 in large hemispheric infection based upon the effects observed on mortality and cerebral edema in the Phase II study. I would now like to turn my attention to specialized immunology.\nWe currently have 2 Phase III assets in SLE, including dapirolizumab pegol in collaboration with UCB and BIIB059, our anti-BDCA2 antibody developed in-house at Biogen. These 2 assets represent potential first-in-class molecules in SLE. BIIB059 also has the potential to be a first-in-class biologic in cutaneous lupus eridometosis, or CLE.\nCLE is a skin-based autoimmune disease that can be associated with severe scarring and dyspigmentation. In the Phase II LILAC study, the CLE part of the study also met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a dose response of BIIB059 on the percent change from baseline in the Class A score. Its standardized scale measuring CLE disease activity at week 16 in individuals with CLE.\nFurthermore, a higher Class C 50 response rate or number of individuals with a 50% or greater improvement from baseline in the Class C A score was observed in patients who received BIIB059 at week 16. Based upon these results, we are currently planning to also initiate a pivotal study for BIIB059 in CLE this year.\nNext, I will touch upon ALS. ALS has been a very key focus area for Biogen for many years. And we remain encouraged by the data from the Phase III VALOR study of tofersen, where despite missing the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline to week 28 in the ALSFRS, we believe there are trends tabling to person across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of biological and clinical activity.\nWe are continuing to collect data in the VALOR open-label extension, and we are actively recruiting for the ATLAS presymptomatic study. Many SOD1 ALS patients have received access to tofersen through the global expanded access program, which is available in countries where local regulations permit it and where we hope to secure long-term access.\nFurther, we are engaged with regulators to determine the next steps for the program. Aside from the areas I've highlighted, Biogen continues to grow and diversify the R&D pipeline, which now includes 32 clinical programs. New additions include the exercise of the option with Ionis on BIIB115, an investigational ASO with the potential for extended dosing intervals in SME as well as the recent initiation of a Phase I study in Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the nervous system and causes severe physical and learning disabilities with symptoms beginning in infancy.\nImportantly, I believe that 2022 will be a significant year for Biogen's pipeline given the number of important readouts expected, including the lucanumab Phase III in Alzheimer's disease, key readouts in neuropsychiatry for both zuranolone in depression and BIIB104 in schizophrenia and BIIB078 in ALS.\nIn closing, I believe Biogen has assembled an extensive pipeline of programs informed by generics, a deep understanding of disease biology, specialized modality expertise and digitalization. Therefore, I believe Biogen is uniquely positioned to shape the future of therapeutics in neurology and specialized immunology and make a difference in patients and their caregivers' lives. I will now pass the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McDonnell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll focus my commentary on fourth quarter results along with some discussion regarding the full year 2021.\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of $2.7 billion declined 4% versus the prior year at both actual and constant currency. Total revenue for the full year of $11 billion declined 18% versus the prior year at actual currency and 19% at constant currency. This decline was mostly driven by TECFIDERA generic entry in the United States.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $3.39. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $19.22. Total MS revenue inclusive of OCREVUS royalties in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion. Global TECFIDERA revenue in the fourth quarter was $486 million. U.S. revenue was $161 million.\nOutside of the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue of $326 million increased by 13% versus the prior year, with 7% growth in underlying patients. Lumerit fourth quarter global revenue was $125 million as compared to $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect Lumerit to continue to grow both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.\nTYSABRI fourth quarter global revenue of $513 million increased 8% versus the prior year, benefiting from positive channel dynamics in the U.S., and we were pleased to see continued global patient growth. Moving to SMA.\nGlobal fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenue of $441 million decreased 12% versus the prior year. In the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $150 million decreased by 6% versus the prior year, as we saw continued impact from competition. However, we were encouraged to see that discontinuations moderated somewhat versus Q3 of this year. U.S. SPINRAZA revenue increased 7% versus the prior quarter, inclusive of some favorable pricing and channel dynamics.\nOutside the U.S., SPINRAZA revenue of $291 million decreased 14% versus the prior year due to competition and pricing pressure. We continue to believe that SPINRAZA can return to growth over the medium to long term.\nTotal ADUHELM revenue for the fourth quarter was $1 million. Moving to our biosimilars business. Fourth quarter revenue of $221 million increased 12% versus the prior year, with increased volume partially offset by pricing pressure. Our Q4 biosimilars revenue benefited from a onetime price adjustment of approximately $10 million.\nLast week, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our equity stake in our biosimilar joint venture, Samsung Bioepis to Samsung Biologics or aggregate consideration of up to $2.3 billion. We believe this represents an attractive financial return given that our cumulative investment in the joint venture was $727 million.\nIt's important to note that we will continue to record revenue and costs associated with the commercialization of BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI with economics that will be substantially unchanged from what you have seen previously. So we are pleased with this transaction because we not only maintain the commercialization rights that we have, but we will also have an expanded ability to pursue additional biosimilars products on our own going forward.\nClosing of this transaction is currently anticipated in mid-2022, contingent on the effectiveness of a securities registration statement filed by Samsung Biologics and satisfaction of certain regulatory and other customary closing conditions.\nTotal anti-CD20 revenue in the fourth quarter of $414 million decreased 1% versus the prior year. Rituxan revenue of $153 million decreased 29% versus the prior year due to the impacts of COVID-19 and continued erosion from biosimilar competition. OCREVUS royalty revenue of $261 million increased 29% versus the prior year. As a reminder, the effective royalty rate for OCREVUS royalties resets each calendar year.\nFourth quarter gross margin was 76% of revenue, down from 83% in Q4 of 2020. And the reduction in gross margin versus prior year was primarily due to a $164 million charge for ADUHELM inventory and purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand.\nMoving now to expenses on the balance sheet. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $700 million, which includes a $60 million opt-in payment to Ionis for BIIB115 and a cost of approximately $50 million for the exercise of our option with Genentech for the biospecific antibody mentioned earlier. We will share any operating profits and losses for this program in the low to mid-30% range in the United States.\nNon-GAAP SG&A was $785 million, including approximately $155 million related to ADUHELM. Eisai's reimbursement of U.S. SG&A costs of approximately $45 million is reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. Fourth quarter collaboration profit sharing reduced our net operating expense by $67 million, which includes reimbursement of approximately $140 million from Eisai related to ADUHELM commercialization, partially offset by $75 million of net profit sharing expense related to our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis.\nDuring Q4 of this year, our effective non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 17%. During 2021, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock for a total value of $1.8 billion. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.8 billion remaining under the share repurchase program, which was authorized in October of 2020. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 147 million shares for the fourth quarter.\nIn 2021, we generated approximately $3.6 billion in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $258 million, and free cash flow was approximately $3.4 billion. We ended the year with $7.3 billion in debt, $4.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and $2.6 billion in net debt. In addition, our $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn as of the end of the year.\nOverall, we remain in a very strong financial position with significant cash and financial capacity to grow the business over the long term. Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2022. We expect full year 2022 revenue to be between $9.7 billion and $10 billion. This financial guidance assumes minimal ADUHELM revenue in 2022, continued declines in Rituxan revenue due to biosimilar competition as well as continued erosion of TECFIDERA revenue in the U.S. due to generic entry. This guidance also assumes the potential entry of TECFIDERA generics in the EU as early as the first half of 2022 as the outcome of the ongoing challenges to TECFIDERA market protection is difficult to predict. We expect the decreased revenue from these high-margin products to reduce our gross margin percentage as compared to 2021.\nWe expect full year 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS between $14.25 and $16. Our guidance assumptions are highly dependent on the final national coverage determination, which is currently uncertain. If the final NCD, which is expected in April, is not broader than the draft NCD, our anticipated results and guidance may be impacted. This guidance assumes that we will not have any write-offs of ADUHELM inventory in 2022, which is valued at approximately $225 million as of the end of 2021. This guidance also assumes reasonable levels of utilization of our manufacturing capacity dedicated to our Alzheimer's disease programs. If our manufacturing capacity is underutilized, we will incur incremental period costs, which are not reflected in our guidance.\nWe expect non-GAAP R&D expense to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, and our non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. This non-GAAP SG&A expense estimate includes approximately $400 million in support of the launch of ADUHELM, of which approximately $145 million would be reimbursable by Eisai and reflected in the collaboration profit sharing line. These R&D and SG&A expense estimates reflect the implementation of previously disclosed cost reduction measures, which are expected to yield approximately $500 million in annualized savings, of which approximately $350 million is expected to be realized in 2022.\nThese savings are expected to be achieved through various initiatives, which may include downsizing of our global Alzheimer's infrastructure the savings from which would be shared with Eisai and operating efficiency gains across SG&A and R&D. These savings are expected to be offset by approximately $200 million in additional investments in our pipeline and strategic initiatives. In the event of a final NCD that is not broader than the draft NCD, we anticipate taking further cost reduction measures, which are not reflected in our guidance to further align our cost base with our revenue base.\nSome of the savings from these further cost reduction measures would be shared with Eisai. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2022 to be between 15.5% and 16.5%, and we assume that we will utilize a portion of the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion throughout the year, although this will depend on a variety of factors, including our business development activities.\nForeign exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, are assumed to remain in effect for the year, net of hedging activities, we have not included any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions as both are hard to predict or any impact of potential tax or health care reform. I will now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing remarks.\n\nMichel Vounatsos\n\nCEO & Director, Biogen Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. In summary, 2021 was an eventful year for Biogen. ADUHELM is now the first FDA-approved treatment targeting a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease. But as we all know, this is a complex disease, which will require continued investment in research over the years to come. ADUHELM is an important first step, and we remain focused on advancing our leading portfolio with the goal of further addressing the remaining unmet needs for patients. We hope that over time, we'll be able to bring additional impactful treatment options, which will build on the scientific learnings from ADUHELM similar to the waves of innovation we have seen in oncology.\nBefore I conclude, let me touch on Biogen's strong commitment to corporate responsibility, climate, health and equity are deeply integrated challenges that demand bold action, and that's why we are working to advance a healthier, more sustainable and equitable world. Through our Signature initiative, Healthy Climate, Healthy Lives and other efforts, our goal is to create new ways of doing business that positively impact the way we live and the way we deliver for patients. We are proud that our leadership actions and transparency in this area has been recognized recently by the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, Corporate Knights Global 100 and Just 100.\nThrough this work, we aim to create shareholder value by meeting the needs of our patients, employees, the environment and the communities we serve. In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are committed to engaging with CMS and other stakeholders with the hope of finding an appropriate path forward for the patients in excess of ADUHELM. We will now open the call for questions.",

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Rick Dierker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I'll begin with some thoughts on the macro environment and then a review of our great Q3 results. Then I'll turn the call over to Lee McChesney, our CFO. And then when Lee is done, we'll open it up for questions. Starting with the broader environment, conditions remain volatile and the consumer backdrop remains mixed. Commercial -- is elevated in some categories and household finances are stretched as high borrowing cost and delinquencies weigh on discretionary spending, including big-ticket items like cars and housing.\nHowever, there is relatively low unemployment and higher priced personal care categories continue to do well. Against that mixed backdrop, our categories are growing at around 2%, which was pretty consistent with what happened in Q2 as well. We're performing better than that because of our great brands. Our portfolio with its balance of value and premium offerings continue to gain both dollar and volume share. Our innovation is performing well and all in all, our brands are made for environments like this.\nOn to the Q3 results, we had a fantastic quarter in a tough environment. Organic sales grew 3.4%, exceeding our outlook of 1% to 2%. Adjusted gross margin was up 10 basis points, also exceeding our outlook. Adjusted EPS was $0.01, which was $0.09 higher than our $0.72 outlook. Lee will take you through the rest of the numbers shortly. But first, some highlights about our brands. In July, we closed our recent acquisition, Touchland.\nTouchland is the fastest-growing brand in the hand sanitizer category in the U.S. It's the #2 hand sanitizer in the category with household penetration just under 7% and the category at 42%, indicating a lot of runway for growth. Teslin experienced strong growth in Q3, with consumption growing double digits and results exceeded our initial expectations. I'm even more optimistic about Touch land today than even a few months ago, a small but mighty team doing great things. Now I'm going to turn my comments to each of the 3 divisions. First up is the U.S. consumer business.\nOrganic sales increased 2.3% with volume growth of 3.7% being partially offset by 1.4% of price mix. Growth was led by their breadth mouthwash products, ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter and Trojan condoms, partially offset by declines in the vitamin business and water flossers. We grew share in 4 of our 8 power brands, specifically ARM & HAMMER, Fair breath Hero and Touchland let me provide a bit of color for a few of our important categories. I'd like to start off with the ARM & HAMMER brand in general. Consumers today want stability and brands they can trust. Our new campaign give it the whole darn arm reinforces the brand strength and reliability.\nThis is driving growth across the portfolio. 5 of the 6 categories we compete in with ARM & HAMMER are growing share on a year-to-date basis. Turning to laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent consumption grew 1.9% in contrast to a flat category. ARM & HAMMER share in the quarter reached 15%. Beyond share and more importantly, household penetration for the long term continues to matter. And in the quarter, ARM & HAMMER laundry expanded household penetration 0.7 points to an all-time high of 30%.\nIn fact, the only tier of laundry detergent that was positive consumption in the quarter was the value tier. This is a sign of the times as value was flat to declining in the previous 8 quarters, this is especially impressive as our actual promotional spending for laundry was lower year-over-year. Moving to Litter, ARM & HAMMER litter consumption grew 5.3%, while the category was up 5%. We saw heightened competitive promotions, especially in the lightweight segment by 1 competitor. Over to mouthwash, air breadth continues to perform extremely well, while the mouthwash category was down in Q3, their breath consumption grew 17%, and continues to be the #2 mouthwash with a 21.8% share.\nRemember, we believe there's a lot of runway here. Our household penetration for THERABREATH currently sits at 11% versus the category of 65%. I Hero once again outpaced the category with consumption growth of 5.2% compared to a flat acne category and remains the #1 brand in acne care with a 23.6% share. And like the THERABREATH story, we believe household penetration growth is key for this brand. It sits at 9% versus the category of 28%.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about our pipeline of new products. We even announced a few today. They're a key driver of our success. Their breadth is introducing a new line of toothpaste. We launched online with 3 variants in August, and they target key consumer needs of healthy gums, deep cleaning and whitening all combined with long-lasting fresh breadth. The brand's loyal users value its effective cleaning is distinctive fresh but not overpowering taste and we have a retail launch set for January 2026. We're very encouraged with the high-quality consumer reviews were seen. Meanwhile, Trojan, the #1 condom brand in the U.S. launched Trojan Goat, greatest of all Trojan, which is a non-latex condom featuring patent-pending Ultra Flex material that's soft, flexible, ores and colorless designed to enhance body heat transfer to deliver next-level intimacy.\nTurning to international. Our national business delivered sales growth of 8.4% in the quarter. Organic increased 7.7% due to a combination of higher volume price and mix. Growth was led by the Hero THERABREATH and BATISTE brands and was broad-based across many of our international markets. I was just in Argentina 2 weeks ago with our Global Markets Group and distributor partners, and there is a lot of excitement for the future.\nFinally, SBD organic sales increased 4.2% due to a combination of higher price and product mix and volume. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities in this business. As noted previously, we're undertaking a strategic review of our vitamin business, including streamlining our supply chain to strengthen the core business, new JV partnership opportunities and divestiture options. We're seeing -- we're seeing improved velocities in the core and line reviews are receiving positive retailer feedback on new products and long-term brand strategy. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion from this review by the end of 2025. Looking ahead, our full year organic growth outlook is 1%, the midpoint of our prior range. We expect full year adjusted EPS growth for 2025 to now $3.49 or $0.02 higher than our previous outlook to the higher sales and improved margins, including higher marketing spend.\nAs in past years, when we have stronger-than-expected business performance, we invest for the future. So we now expect marketing as a percentage of sales to exceed 11%, and these investments will continue our momentum into 2026. I'll close by saying that category consumption remains stable and our brands remain in a position of strength. We're gaining dollar and volume share across key segments of the portfolio, supported by a balanced mix of value and premium offerings. We're well positioned to navigate the current environment. The strategic actions we're executing will set us up for sustained success.\nOur go-forward portfolio has never been stronger. At the same time, we remain active in evaluating the right acquisition opportunities to further build our business. I'm excited to speak at Investor Day in January about some of the growth initiatives we have in development. With that, I'd like to close by thanking all of the Church & Dwight employees for executing well in a volatile environment. And now I'll hand the call over to Lee for more detail on the quarter.\n\nLee B. McChesney\n\nChief Finance Officer of Global Tools & Storage, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good day to everyone on this Halloween for Friday. Our Church & Dwight team members across the globe delivered a quarter to be proud of that highlights once against the many strengths of our portfolio and our team's capabilities. Let's jump into the third quarter and our outlook. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.81, up 2.5% from the prior year. The $0.81 was better than our $0.72 outlook, driven by higher volume and gross margin results favorable to our outlook. Reported revenue was up 5% and organic sales were up 3.4%.\nThe organic sales was broad-based across the globe with volume growth of 4%, partially offset by negative pricing and mix of 0.6% and beyond organic results, we were delighted with the encouraging start of Touch land as sales exceeded our initial projections. Our third quarter adjusted gross margin was 45.1%, a 10 basis point increase from a year ago and 110 basis points better than our outlook. Our results versus last year were driven by 170 basis points from productivity programs, 20 basis points from higher margin acquisitions 10 basis points from FX and 10 basis points from the combination of volume, price and mix. These factors offset 200 basis points of inflation and tariff costs. Moving to marketing.\nOur marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 12.8% in or 50 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year. And for the year, we are now targeting to exceed 11% of net sales as we leverage our improved sales growth to invest for the future. Q3 adjusted SG&A increased 20 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted other expense increased by $3.9 million due to the lower interest income compared to last year. And we continue to expect other expense for the full year to be approximately $65 million on an adjusted basis, reflecting the lower interest income following the Touch land acquisition.\nIn 3Q, our adjusted tax rate was 21.6% compared to 23.3% in Q3 of '24, a 170 basis point year-over-year decrease. And the expected adjusted effective tax rate for the year is now 22.5%. And now to cash. We delivered strong cash results in the quarter as cash flow from operations increased 19.6% versus last year to $435.5 million. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $67.2 million, a $58 million decrease from the prior year due to return to normalized capital spending in 2025.\nAnd finally, in the third quarter, the company repurchased an additional $300 million of shares, which brings our year-to-date share repurchases up to $600 million for our shareholders, certainly a third quarter full of accomplishments.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. Broadly, we continue to navigate well in an environment of economic uncertainty and as a result, have improved our outlook in several areas. For the year, we now expect reported sales growth of approximately 1.5% versus a prior year midpoint view of 1.0 as we expect Touchland's momentum to continue in the fourth quarter. We also remain on track to deliver 2025 organic growth of approximately 1%, the midpoint of our previous outlook, and we now expect full year gross mention to contract only 40 basis points versus 2024 based on the progress our teams are delivering from productivity programs to counter inflation and tariff headwinds.\nAnd as I noted earlier, the combination of a stronger sales and gross margin outlook allows us to increase our marketing investments beyond our prior outlook in 2025. For the year, we now expect an adjusted EPS of $3.49, which exceeds the midpoint of our prior outlook. And specifically for 4Q, we now expect reported sales growth of approximately 3.5% and an organic sales growth of approximately 1.5%. In 4Q, I note that our reported sales outlook include larger decline in sales from our discontinued businesses as these product lines run out of inventory.\nAnd for some context, we expect $30 million of lower sales or 200 basis points of drag in the fourth quarter versus last year from these discontinued businesses. And also note that our organic growth for 4Q was impacted by the prior year port strike and the negative consumption trends in our VMS business. In 4Q, our adjusted gross margin will contract approximately 50 basis points primarily from inflation and tariff costs. Marketing will be lower compared to last year. We expect an adjusted EPS of $0.83 per share, which is an increase of 8% versus last year's adjusted EPS.\nIn my final '25 comment the outlook really covers cash flow from operations. As noted in our press release, we've increased our outlook from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in consideration of our progress on several fronts. As our teams look forward, we are optimistic our teams across the globe have delivered significant accomplishments. We continue to fuel share gains. We've made strategic choices to exit brands in our portfolio.\nWe've acquired Touchland, which is off to a great start, and we've returned $600 million to our shareholders through share repurchases. A big thank you to our employees across the globe for leaning forward and executing through the first 3 quarters of the year. Very well done. Eric, let's move to Q&A.",

Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Richard Dierker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I'll begin with a review of Q2 results. I'll speak to the touch on closing, strategic actions and some thoughts on the macro environment. Then I'll turn the call over to Lee McChesney, our CFO. When Lee is done, we'll open the call up for questions.\nFirst, I'll begin with Q2 results. Organic sales grew 0.1%, exceeding our outlook of minus 2% to flat. Adjusted gross margin was down 40 basis points, also exceeding our outlook range. Adjusted EPS was $0.94, which was $0.09 higher than our $0.85 outlook. Lee will take you through the rest of the numbers shortly, but first, some highlights from the quarter. When we gave our outlook back in May, we were seeing category consumption data that was shown a deceleration from strong growth early in the year to turning negative in early April. The good news is that since then, things have begun to improve with categories finishing positive in April and Q2 category consumption for our largest categories, finishing around 2.5%. The macro environment has been volatile and uncertain with tariff policies changing frequently. The consumer uncertainty showed up in early Q2 when consumer confidence hit a 12-year low. Since then, consumer confidence levels have started to recover as tariff policy appeared to stabilize. Not surprisingly, given that backdrop, our second quarter sales finished slightly ahead of our outlook, which gives us confidence in achieving our full year organic outlook of 0% to 2%. Our brands continue to perform well in this dynamic environment. We continue to drive both dollar and volume share gains across most of our brands. Our balanced portfolio of value and premium products and our relentless focus on innovation continues to position us well for the future. International continues to take share across the globe. Further, we continue to grow the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching 23%. In July, we closed our most recent acquisition, Touch land is the fastest-growing brand in the hand sanitizer category in the U.S. and is the #2 and sanitizer in the category. Touchland experienced strong growth in Q2, outpacing the category and gaining share. We're excited to add Touchland as our eighth power brand and even more so excited to officially welcome the Touchland team to Church & Dwight.\nNow let's discuss the strategic actions we outlined last quarter to drive shareholder value, management team assessed each of our brands on a regular basis. As a result of these reviews, we often accelerate and increased investments in our strongest brands and move the speed to address opportunities for value creation. That review is what led to the strategic decision to exit FLAWLESS, SPINBRUSH and WATERPIK showerhead business.\nToday, we'll provide an update on our vitamin business. We remain focused on our revitalization efforts with multiple innovation and branding programs underway in 2025. while it's still too early to fully evaluate results, we can share at this time that we're seeing mixed results. There are some green shoots. We see our multivitamin business improving week over week, and our innovation has [ stained ] strong consumer reviews, and of course, we remain focused on executing our improvement actions. In addition, we are undertaking a strategic review of the business, including streamlining our supply chain to strengthen our core business, potential JV and partnership opportunities and divestiture options. The Gummy vitamin business continues to be a drag on the company's organic growth. The good news is the Gummy vitamin category grew almost 4%. And which is the third consecutive quarter of growth. The bad news is our consumption was down around 25% as our TDPs declined.\nNow I'm going to turn my comments to each of the 3 businesses and the improved results from our teams in the second quarter. First up is the U.S. consumer business. Organic sales declined 1% with volume growth being offset by negative price mix. Volume growth was muted by continued retail destocking in Q2. We continue to expect slight impacts moving forward. Consumption was positive in the quarter for the U.S. business with momentum improving and we grew share in 5 of our 7 power brands. Let me provide a bit of color for a few of our important categories. First, with laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER liquid latter detergent consumption grew 3.2% in contrast to 1.3% category growth. ARM & HAMMER share in the quarter reached 15%.\nMoving to Litter, ARM & HAMMER [ Litter ] consumption grew 3.4%, while the category was up 4.1% as we saw heightened competitive promotions. Nextremely is BATISTE, BATISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo. And while consumption was down almost 7% in the quarter, we're confident in BATISTE return to consumption growth in the future. There are a couple of factors contributing to consumption decline, such as competitive price increases, economic pressure driving trade down, and we had some supply issues that are now resolved. This year, we're launching BATISTE Light as a leading brand, our innovations continue to attract new users to the category to increase household penetration.\nOver mouthwash, THERABREATH continues to perform extremely well. While the mouthwash category was down in Q2, THERABREATH consumption grew 22.5% and and continues to be the #2 mouthwash with a 21% share. Remember, we believe there's a lot of runway here. Our household penetration for THERABREATH currently sits around 11% versus the category of 65%. HERO once again outpaced the category with consumption growth of 11.4% compared to the acne category growth of 1.5% and remains the #1 brand in acne care with a 22% share. Equally important as HERO continues to gain share in acne patches. And similar to the terabit story, we believe household penetration growth is key for this brand. It sits at 9% versus the category of 28%. HERO continues to launch innovative solutions and patches and is entering the growing body care segment in 2025 with the [ Motipatch body ]. Looking ahead, we're excited about our pipeline of new products, which remain a key driver of our success. In 2025, we expect continued innovation to power our growth and build on momentum, especially in several core categories where we're leading the way.\nNow turning to international SPD. Our International business delivered sales growth of 5.3% in the quarter, organic increased 4.8% due to a combination of higher volume, price and mix. Growth was led by HERO, THERABREATH and THIMFRESH and was broad-based with all of our subs delivering growth. We were able to grow share in all of our power brands in the quarter, which is a great achievement.\nFinally, SBD Organic sales increased 0.1% due to a combination of higher price and product mix offset by volume. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities in this business. Looking ahead, our full year organic growth outlook continues to be 0% to 2%, while category consumption has improved. There remains uncertainty around the U.S. consumer and global economy. We expect our Q2 brand share momentum to continue, supported by our new product launches, our distribution gains and sustained full year investment in marketing.\nAdjusted EPS, we continue to expect 0% to 2% growth, which includes the Touchland acquisition, the cost of the product recall and the wind down of the 3 exited businesses.\nI'll close by saying that category consumption is looking a bit better than 3 months ago, and our brands are strong. They're doing well. We're gaining both dollar and volume share across much of the portfolio. We have a healthy mix of value and premium offerings we're well equipped to navigate the current environment. The strategic actions we're taking will position the company well for the future, and we continue to be on the hunt for the right acquisitions. I'd like to thank all the Church & Dwight employees for executing well in a volatile environment. And now I'll hand it over to Lee for more detail on the quarter.\n\nLee B. McChesney\n\nChief Finance Officer of Global Tools & Storage, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good day to everyone. Well, as Rick just mentioned, we've just concluded a very productive quarter from our teams across the globe. As we shared during our first quarter call, we remain focused on what we control in the second quarter, and this positions us well as we look forward to the second half of 2025. Let's dive into the second quarter and our outlook. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.94, up 1% from the prior year. The $0.94 was better than our $0.85 outlook, driven by a stronger sales performance and some good resiliency with gross margin. Reported revenue was down 0.3% and organic sales were up 0.1%. The organic sales were on the high side of our May 1 outlook, and it reflects the improvements we saw in category growth and the strength of our brands.\nOur second quarter adjusted gross margin was 45.0%, a 40 basis point decrease from a year ago. Productivity and higher-margin acquisition, business mix drove 170 basis points of margin growth and offset a negative 140 basis points from inflation and tariffs, 40 basis points from the combination of volume, price and mix and 30 basis points from the ZICAM Orajel swab recall. I'd also note that a portion of our original tariff estimate about 20 to 30 basis points we expected in the second quarter shifted to the third quarter as the tariff rates and the shipment timing evolved.\nMoving to marketing. Our marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 10.4% or 30 basis points higher than 2Q of last year. And for the year, we continue to target 11% of net sales, in line with our evergreen model. We are encouraged with our share results in the first half of the year.\nFor SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 80 basis points year-over-year. And other expense decreased by $5.2 million due to higher interest income. And we now expect other expense for the full year to be approximately $65 million on an adjusted basis, reflecting the lower investment income following the Touchland acquisition. In 2Q, our effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 24% in Q2 of 2024, a 20 basis point year-over-year decrease. The expected adjusted effective tax rate for the full year continues to be 23%.\nAnd now to cash. For the first 6 months of 2025, cash from operating activities was $416.5 million, a decrease of $83 million versus last year due to working capital timing and lower cash earnings.\nNow capital expenditures for the first 6 months were $39 million, a $37.6 million decrease from the prior year. And we continue to expect CapEx of approximately $130 million as we return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025. And in the second quarter, the company executed a $300 million share repurchase and via open market transactions through an accelerated share repurchase program.\nOkay. Let's now turn -- spend a few minutes on our outlook. For the full year, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 0% to 2%, and which includes the addition of a Touchland acquisition and the impact of lower sales from the businesses where we're exiting. To quantify that for you, that's about $70 million to $80 million of Touchland coming in and $78 million going out for the businesses being exited. We continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 0% to 2%. The sales outlook reflects our brand and category growth momentum and reflects a balanced macro view around the uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies. We continue to expect full year gross margin to contract 60 basis points versus 2024 from elevated input costs and tariffs, the recall expense, unfavorable price and mix to outpace incremental productivity and higher-margin acquisition impacts.\nAnd looking forward, Touchland is margin rate positive, but for this year, the business exits mitigate that benefit. And we're maintaining our adjusted EPS outlook for 2025. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be 0% to 2%, which includes the key elements we highlighted after the first quarter, but also includes a Touchland, which is neutral EPS for 2025, the wind down of the 3 business exits, in the cost of the product recall. For 3Q, we expect reported organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 2%, adjusted gross margin contraction of approximately 100 basis points, primarily from inflation and tariff costs, and the lower margins of the exited businesses. Marketing will be higher sequentially compared to last year. And as a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.72 per share, which is a decrease of 9% versus last year adjusted EPS.\nCash flow from operations for the full year remains $1.05 billion. In July, we also expanded our revolver facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. In a combination of this cash flow and the expanded credit facilities provides us excellent flexibility. Our M&A team accordingly continues to pursue accretive acquisitions that meet our strict criteria, with an emphasis on fast-moving consumable products, similar to our recent acquisitions.\nTo conclude, back on May 1, we communicated our proactive set of actions to navigate 2025. And as Rick and I just highlighted, we've made great progress and we're focused on sustained execution for the remainder of the year.\nSo with that, we're happy to take your questions. So Eric, we'll turn it to you.",

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Rick Dierker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with some thoughts on the macro environment and review our Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Lee McChesney, our new CFO. When Lee is done, we'll open the call up for questions.\nAs you read in the release, we have several topics to discuss this morning, including Q1 results, portfolio changes, tariff management, U.S. consumer spending and the revised full year outlook.\nWith that, let's turn to how we performed in Q1. During our presentation at CAGNY in February, we stated we expected our organic sales growth to be at the low end of 0% to 2% range due to retail destocking and weakening consumer demand as it turned out, organic sales decreased 1.2%, falling short of our outlook. Retailer destocking accounted for a drag of approximately 300 basis points on organic growth. The good news is our strong brand performance. We gained share in 9 of our 14 major brands as our consumption outpaced category growth. 80% plus of our business grew volume share in the quarter. Contributing to our Q1 results is our success in the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching close to 23%.\nIn a few minutes, I'll contrast our Q1 consumption with category growth when I comment on the major categories. Regarding earnings per share, adjusted EPS was $0.91 beating our outlook by $0.01. Now let's discuss the strategic actions we outlined in the press release. Each year, our management team reviews our brand portfolio with the Board of Directors. And in concert with that review, the company completes a valuation exercise for each and every brand. As a result of that review, the company is pursuing strategic alternatives for the FLAWLESS, and Waterpik showerhead business, which means we'll be shutting down or selling these businesses. These businesses generate $150 million of net sales or around 2% of our total net sales, with below average profitability. We expect to take a charge in Q2 relative to this decision.\nThis decision will prune our portfolio, sharpen our focus on core brands, and mitigate a significant tariff exposure, which is the next topic I would like to discuss.\nTurning to tariffs. While the tariff situation remains fluid, the company is currently projecting a gross 12-month run rate tariff exposure of $190 million. The net impact of the portfolio decisions and a series of supply chain actions is expected to reduce our tariff exposure by approximately 80%. The supply chain actions include no longer sourcing Waterpik flossers from China for the U.S. market.\nOur ability to move with urgency to execute these changes as a testament to the Church & Dwight culture. I'm very proud of the company and the reaction that we've done here.\nNow I'm going to turn my comments to each of the 3 businesses. First up is the U.S. Consumption was positive in the quarter for the U.S. business while organic sales declined 3%, entirely driven by negative volume from retail destocking. So let's look at the trend line. In the U.S., consumer spending continues to sequentially weaken. For context, it's constructive to look back at our U.S. year-over-year category growth since around mid-2024.\nIn the second half of 2024, category growth averaged 25%. In Q1, our categories grew around 1.5%. March was flat and April was negative 1%. And remember, for context, over the last 10 years or so, category growth is typically around 3%. In addition to the consumer, retailers took inventory actions, which impacted our top line.\nNow I'm going to provide a bit of color for a few of our important categories. Let's start off with laundry detergent. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent consumption grew 3.4% in contrast to 0 category growth. ARM & HAMMER share in the quarter reached 14.7%. There's a similar story on unit dose. ARM & HAMMER unit dose saw consumption growth of 26.9%, which drove 120 basis point share gain to reach a 5.5 share. This is in contrast to a weak unit dose category, which declined 1.1%.\nNow moving to Litter, similar story to laundry, the category was up 1.9%, while ARM & HAMMER litter consumption grew 2.3%, which outpaced the category and share reached 24.9%. The gummy vitamin business continues to be a drag on the company's organic growth. The gummy vitamin category grew 4.8%, which is the second consecutive quarter of growth. The bad news is our consumption was down 19%. The plans that we shared with you on previous calls will begin to be visible in the market started in May. Those actions include new products and enhanced taste profile and new creative marketing. We'll update you on our progress on the Q2 call.\nNext step is BATISTE, consumption was down 5% in the quarter with share declining 3.4%. There are a couple of contributing factors. One is we were experiencing some supply chain issues that have since been resolved. In addition, a competitor had a significant price increase that impacted our dollar share. On a positive note, PTIs continues to be the global leader in Dryshimpoo, and this year, we're launching BATISTE Light. As a leading brand, our innovations continue to attract new users to the category and increase household penetration. Over in mouthwash, THERABREATH continues to perform extremely well. While the mouthwash category was flat in Q1, therapy breadth consumption grew 26% and is now the #2 mouthwash with a 20.3% share. Remember, we believe there's a lot of runway here as our household penetration for THERABREATH currently sits around 10.5% versus the category of 65%. HERO is the #1 brand in acne care with a 22% share and continues to drive growth. Hero grew consumption by 13%, outpacing a 1.1% decline in the category. HERO market share grew 280 basis points in the quarter. And similar to the THERABREATH story, we believe household penetration growth is key for this brand. Currently, it sits at 8.7% versus the category of 25%. The HERO continues to launch innovative solutions and patches and entering the growing body care segment in 2025 with the mighty patch body.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about our pipeline of new products, which remain a key driver of our success. In 2025, we expect continued innovation to power our growth and build on our momentum, especially in several core categories where we're leading the way. And we spoke about many of these at our Analyst Day in New York.\nNow turning to international and SPD. Our international business delivered sales growth of 2.7% in the quarter. Organic sales increased 5.8%, largely due to higher volume. Growth was led by HERO, THERABREATH and WATERPIK and was broad-based with all of our subs delivering growth. Finally, SPD organic sales increased 3.2% due to a combination of higher price and price mix and higher volume. This business continues to deliver, and we continue to be excited about the future.\nLooking ahead, our full year organic growth outlook is now 0% to 2%, driven by a weaker U.S. consumer. We expect our Q1 brand share momentum to continue, bolstered by our new product launches, our distribution gains and sustained full year investment in marketing. After considering the trend line that I shared with you, we do not see a catalyst for improvement in the U.S. consumer. Our outlook also reflects no bounce back from Q1 retailer destocking.\nFor adjusted EPS, we now expect 0% to 2% growth, which reflects the impact of lower sales and the impact of tariffs. I'll close by saying that despite a slowdown in category consumption, our brands are strong. They're doing well. We're gaining both dollar and volume share across much of the portfolio with a healthy mix of value and premium offerings and we're well equipped to navigate the current environment. The strategic actions we announced today will position the company well for the future, and we continue to be on the hunt for the right acquisitions.\nI'd like to thank all the Church & Dwight employees for executing well in a volatile environment. And now I'll hand it over to Lee for more detail on the quarter.\n\nLee B. McChesney\n\nChief Finance Officer of Global Tools & Storage, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good day to everyone. Before I jump into the quarter, I do want to say thank you to Rick and the entire CHD team for the warm welcome. I've only been here for a month or so, I've already seen what makes this company such a strong performer as the team is focused on execution. We are acting swiftly to address the challenging macro environment that nearly every company is facing today. With that, let's dive into the first quarter and our outlook.\nWe'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.91, down 5.2% from the prior year. The $0.91 was slightly better than our $0.90 outlook. Reported revenue was down 2.4% and organic sales was down 1.2%. The organic sales decline was due to lower volume of 1.4%, partially offset by positive pricing and mix of 0.2%. Our first quarter adjusted gross margin was 45.1% and a 60 basis point decrease from a year ago with improved productivity, positive mix and higher margin acquisitions being offset by the impact of commodity inflation, higher manufacturing costs and lower volume.\nLet me walk you through our Q1 gross margin bridge. We saw 160 basis points from productivity, a favorable 10 basis points from the combination of mix and price and a positive 10 basis points related to the acquisitions. Those factors were offset by the headwinds I just mentioned above and 20 basis points related to FX.\nMoving to marketing. Our marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 9.3% were 80 basis points lower than 1Q of last year. For the year, we are targeting 11% of net sales. And accordingly, we expect to continue our first quarter momentum and gaining market share. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the year-over-year volume change. Other expense decreased by $7.7 million, inclusive of lower interest expense, and higher interest income. We continue to expect other expense for the full year to be approximately $50 million on an adjusted basis.\nIn Q1, our effective tax rate was 22% compared to 19.9% in Q1 of 24%, a 210 basis point year-over-year increase. The expected adjusted effective tax rate for the full year continues to be 23%. And now to cash. For the 3 months of 2025, cash from operating activities was $185.7 million, a decrease of $77.3 million versus last year due to lower cash earnings and the sales timing impact on working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the first 3 months was $16.5 million, a $29.8 million decrease from the prior year. We expect 2025 CapEx of approximately $130 million as we return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025. Let's now take a few minutes to walk through our outlook. For the full year, we now expect our organic revenue outlook to be approximately 0% to 2%. Previously, that was 3% to 4%. The sales outlook now reflects the slower category growth and the retailer inventory reductions that we don't expect to recover.\nFull year gross margin is now expected to contract 60 basis points versus 2024. Previously, that was a positive 25 basis point outlook as we expect the tariff impacts persistent commodity input inflation costs to offset the incremental productivity. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be 0% to 2%, down from our previous view of 7% to 8%. This is primarily due to the lower sales outlook, and the tariff pressures. Cash flow from operations for the full year is now estimated to be approximately $1.05 billion due to the impact of our lower EPS and the onetime charges.\nFor 2Q, we expect organic sales of approximately negative 2% to flat and as a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.85 per share, a decrease of 9% versus last year. last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. As our outlook implies, we expect EPS growth to be weighted towards the back half of 25% through the marketing investment timing versus last year.\nAnd finally, as we noted in our release, this adjusted outlook as of April 1, 2025, excludes charges and the ongoing results for the FLAWLESS and WATERPIK shower business. Those charges are expected to be between $60 million and $80 million largely recorded in 2Q and 2/3 is expected to be noncash.\nWith that, Rick and I would be happy to take any questions.",

    "content": "Full Year 2024 Church & Dwight Co Inc Earnings Call and Investor Day\n\nFull Year 2024 Church & Dwight Co Inc Earnings Call And Investor Day\n\nCHDNYSEJAN 31, 12:00 PM\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everybody. Thanks for coming today. This is the 2025 Analyst Day for Church & Dwight. We got a big crowd with us today. We got the entire management team. We got a couple of casualties due to the flu that's going around.\nSo let's begin with the safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read that after class. And I'm going to -- here's the list of the people who are going to be here today. I'll present -- it's got Sateesh Chava from SPD, you've got Mike Reed from International; got Surabhi Pokhriyal for our Chief Digital Officer, it's the Rick and Matt show as usual. We've got Stacy Ramstad, who is our CMO; and Carlos Linares, he haven't heard from Carlos in the past, he is R&D and innovation for the company. .\nAll right. Long agenda here. I won't read it to. So let's kind of jump right in. But I'm going to start with 2025 is the 34th anniversary -- 35th anniversary of Church & Dwight being listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And you can see the chart there, if you adjust for stock splits, it was a butter back in 1990. And you can see we're well over $100 today. Here's kind of a fun fact. So if you invested $1,000 in Church & Dwight, 1990 when it was first listed, it'd be worth $114,000 today. So that's kind of a mark of a consistent company. And the fell on the lower left is the Dwight Minton. And Dwight, he came the CEO, I think in 1969. And he is the descendant of Austin Church of the Church & Dwight fame. So he's the last family member of the company to take -- to be a CEO. And he succeeded his dad who was CEO before him. So I'm the third nonfamily member who's CEO of Church & Dwight, and Rick will be the fourth, so fun fact.\nSo let's look back at 2024. As you all know, if you our story, organic sales growth. We beat our algorithm, all 3 businesses: U.S., international and SPD. We have 7 power brands represent 70% of our revenues and profits and 5 or 7 increased their market share. Our algorithm for our marketing spend is spend about 11% annually and we spent over 11% in 2024. Innovation is a big number for us this past year. So if we grew our growth 4% on a full year basis, half of that came from new products that we launched in 2024, and that's incremental growth year-over-year came from new products. And then online sales, you've been a bit of a standout among CPG companies for quite a few years. Our online sales over 21%, it's 21.4% for total company. What that translates to is if you have $6 billion in sales, we got $1.3 billion of that is order online.\nA few more things. We bought Hero a couple of years ago. That's been a great brand for us. We've expanded now launched in 40 countries. And now our job is to grow that brand in those 40 countries around the world. Japan is a big market, over 100 million consumers. We acquired a terrific distributor of ours. And Japan is a distributor that drove OxiClean to the #1 prewash additive and powder in Japan. SPD and you'll here from Sateesh Chava today. And that's now a perennial grower for us. I'm going to hear more about that.\nWe generate a lot of cash as a company, over $1.1 billion for 2024. And we had a lot of debt on the balance sheet, almost $1 billion of cash at year-end. And we're all dressed up to buy some businesses going forward.\nstrong performance. This is the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5- and 10-year chart for us. And just to give you an idea of the consistency of this company for many, many years, and it's really attributed to the culture and to the management team of Church & Dwight.\nWe are. Many of you are long-term holders, people who are here today are listening on the phone. So I'm going to run through things that should be very familiar to you. So the way we're split is 77% domestic, 18% international. For a long time, that international number was 17%, almost since I joined the company. So we're starting to grow that one a little faster. 7 power brands, that make up 70% of our revenues and profits. And you know we have an evergreen model. So this evergreen model is something that guides our view long term, not just for the coming year, but 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. This is what we're trying to drive -- how we try to drive TSR for our shareholders. So you see the 4% organic sales growth, it's 3, 8, 5 domestic, international, SP. Our gross margin, 25 to 50 basis points. The bright line for marketing is around 11% of sales. We try to get leverage on SG&A. So we try to grow the top line faster than SG&A grows. And we're trying to expand our operating margins 50 basis points annually. And that translates into 8% EPS growth.\nSo here is the formula. 5 things I'm going to cover. One, we got a balanced and diversified portfolio, right? So we got pretty much balanced between household and personal care. And SPD is essentially a foundational business for the company. It's where the ARM & HAMMER brand first arose.\nOkay. We're split pretty much 60-40 or I should say, 2/3, 1/3 between premium and value. Why is that important? It's important because we performed well in just about any economic environment.\nWe don't have a lot of exposure to private label. You can see that a little bit over 10%. That's been true for many, many years. And e-commerce has been a great story for us. We were probably fourth quartile back in 2016, and now we're first quartile with respect to our performance online. And as I said earlier, half of our growth -- organic growth in 2024 came from new products. And of course, that is so important to the equity of your brands is new innovation. So that speaks really well for the company. And we got a lot more common in 2025.\nAs far as acquisitions go, we're pretty strict about what we're going to buy, got to be a #1 or #2 brand. It has to be a gross margin that's at or above the gross margins for the company. We like businesses that are asset light, prefer to buy a business that is co-manufactured that we don't necessarily have to buy a plant. Number 4 would be, can we get synergies. We've got a very, very sophisticated supply chain to make damn or anything. So consequently, we try to get leverage in manufacturing or logistics. And then finally, it's got to have a long-term competitive advantage, meaning we don't buy something that's just going to be successful for the next 2 or 3 years. It's going to be successful 5 years, 10 years out.\nAll right. long history of growth through acquisitions. So if you look at 2004, we were a $1.5 billion company, you can see almost every year, we've acquired a business. We don't have every year up there, but just every we've acquired something. 2023 and 2024, a bit of a drought. I'd say, if you said when have you had a drought before. If you look at 2008, we acquired Orajel. 2012, we acquired the vitamin business. Between them, we bought some small businesses. But I would say that was the time -- last time when we had a drought of a couple of years, not for lack of trying, though.\nSo now Rick is going to come up and take you through a few more details.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. So this is probably one of the last times. I'm going to go through detailed financials with you guys. Okay. Q4 2024, we ended the year with momentum, right? We had 3.5% reported sales growth. Our outlook was 1.5% to 2.5%. It came in better than we expected. Our share gains for the quarter, [ 5 of 7 ] for the year, [ 5 of 7 ] of our brands per share, right? Those are the important brands that are driving the company. 4.2% organic came in better than we thought 2, 2% to 3% was our outlook. Gross margin came right where we thought it was. We called 110 basis points for the full year. That implied flat for the quarter. And then for EPS, we were up almost 19%. So just really strong ending to the year in the quarter.\nSo for the full year, 4% net sales growth, 4.5% organic sales growth, 3.5% for domestic, 9% for international and 7% for SPD. So just really broad-based growth across the company, across the divisions, back to 110 points of gross margin, you're going to see in a minute, we're back to 2019 levels, which is fantastic.\nMarketing, this is where we spent incrementally. We ended up at [ 11.4 ] So we spent significantly more than we originally thought. And this is really just again to have momentum as we entered in 2025. And then 8.5% EPS growth, and we generated $1.16 billion of cash. You're going to see in a minute. 2025, we think we're going to be right around the same number. So just generating a lot of cash. Our free cash flow conversion is around 115%, and that gives us a lot of optionality.\nSo look ahead. Matt did a great job of saying where we have been and where we are, a lot of things that are great about the We have confidence in our future, okay? This is really the outlook for the Evergreen model over the years to come. Matt walked through why that's healthy, why that's doing well. I'm going to walk through in a few minutes how household penetration is a huge opportunity for us in the U.S., right? THERABREATH house, THERABREATH Hero, of course, these fast-growing businesses. But litter and laundry are doing well. Some other brands are driving growth as well.\nMike will come up. He'll talk about the high growth rate that international business has. 8% clip is very impressive. We have high aspirations for that business over the foreseeable future.\nInnovation, Carlos will come and we'll talk about how we innovate. We've totally transformed over the last 5 or 10 years, how we innovate, going from one vector to more like 4 or 5 different vectors. And then Stacy is going to come talk about what we've innovated. And so the new products we have very excited about many of those year 2 as well for some of the big launches we had last year. And then Surabh will talk about our e-commerce growth and being digitally savvy. Our e-com growth, you saw the chart that Matt provided, 2% going to 21%. This is an advantage for us, and we're going to continue to drive that forward, not just domestically but globally.\nFocus on domestic and international M&A. M&A is a huge part of this company. So here's a new slide. This is back in the year 2001 or tiles and we had one power brand. It was ARM & HAMMER. We were $1 billion business. Fast-forward 24 years, and we're ARM & HAMMER is around a $2 billion business, right? Mid-single-digit CAGR over 20 years plus. That brand is known and loved by consumers across many categories. It's rare to have a brand that can play in so many different categories. And then that means we have $4 billion of businesses and brands that are not ARM & HAMMER. And that ability to identify, acquire, integrate and grow brands and businesses is a competitive advantage for us. And we're going to keep that and hold that dear, and we're going to continue to do that as well.\nOkay. Moving to the U.S. story. We are hiring a new U.S. President and a new so, but today, I am the U.S. President as well. So domestically, our algorithm is 3%, right? The company is 4, we do 3, 8 and 5. Okay. We have a long track record of growth organically in the U.S., and we have a lot of confidence in our future. 3.5% this year. Why do we have confidence in our future? We're leaders in growing categories. You'll see in a second. Our categories are largely green. We thrive in difficult environments. Why? Private -- low exposure to private label, but also household and personal care are balanced. And then our acquisitions have room to run.\nOur 7 power brands fuel our growth. Match a slide that said 70% of our sales and profits from those 7 brands in those 8 categories in 2025, it's closer to 75%. So these brands are driving the company.\nHere's the snapshot report card on the categories. So again, we're in the right categories. This isn't happenstance. We acquire businesses that get us into categories that we like the attributes of. Weighted average, 2.7% growth, largely mean in 2024. That's fantastic. And then we're one of very few companies that do this, but here's the scorecard from our brands. This is our share growth. And again, 5 of 7 grew in 2024.\nSo let's go to the individual businesses, Fabric Care. Our laundry business is growing at or above category averages, which is great, gaining share. In fact, we're at all-time share highs. If you look at the left side of the page, we're 5% 18 years ago. And today, we're at 14.5%. And why is that? Well, one thing that's working really well is our good, better, best strategy for ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent. And Orange model is our value brand. ARM & HAMMER with Oxy in the middle, which is our better offering. And then Deep Clean is our best offering, right? Consumers are picking up Deep Clean and there's tilt. The incrementality rate on a engines very impressive. Stacy is going to talk a little bit more about new products around Deep Clean, so stay tuned for that.\nCat Litter. Cat Litter is saying. We're growing at or above category rates. This is actually doubly impressive because a competitor was out of stock last year. And so we maintained -- largely maintained our share despite that, which is a great result.\nHardball is a big opportunity. This is a lightweight litter. And a year ago, we were [indiscernible] share. Today, we're around an 8 share, 7.5% share. If we get our fair share of the clumping litter category, that's about $100 million opportunity. And so we're really encouraged by the progress we've made on lightweight litter category.\nHero and THERABREATH. So Hero is -- first up Hero, the charts. It's 40% growth. It's driving the category. And we're not just talking about -- we are talking about total acne. So we have the #1 share in patch. We had the #1 share in acne as a larger category. We have a lot of room to run. Distribution has been fantastic. We have lots of distribution gains. We think there's more as we spread out on shelf, our TDPs will continue to go up. But more importantly, it's household penetration. 9% household penetration for Hero, 25% for the category. We're going to continue to invest our marketing dollars behind Hero to drive awareness.\nSimilar story for THERABREATH. THERABREATH, 40%-plus consumption. It's driving the category. And it's not just the #1 nonalcohol-mouth wash, it's actually the #2 overall mouthwash. All-time share highs, for the year, 17.5%, but same story is Hero. We a lot of room to run here to on distribution points. We've made some great gains. We think we're going to spread out even more on shelf in the years to come. You'll hear from Mike about Hero and THERABREATH for international. There's great momentum there as well.\nSo household penetration, we're a 10 share in households for THERABREATH, but look at mouthwash. 65% of households have a mouthwash. And so again, we're going to invest marketing dollars and innovation behind this category.\nAnd as you look at the trend line over a long period of time, that just shows that we're the #2 mouthwash and we've been the way for the last 3 or 4 months.\nAnd then BATISTE. BATISTE is a category and a brand that is -- has great growth, mid- to high single digits, and we're gaining share in BATISTE as well, hit an all-time share highs. You're going to hear innovation and even maybe some ad campaigns from Stacy, our CMO.\nVITAFUSION vitamins, this is a business that has declined a bit. But let's take us back is the category. The category doubled over the last 2 or 3 years, went from $1.5 billion to $3 billion. It's stabilized and is flat now for these last 3 years. What's happening now? We're down a bit. We're down double digits. The good news is the category is starting to inflect, right? That's a green shoot that's happening. And what are we going to do about it? We brought forward and rapidly, we broke glass in the organization, to move innovation at a very fast clip. So we're launching an entirely renovated portfolio. This goes across all of our SKUs in terms of new and improved formula, that's number one. Number two, we're launching our most powerful vitamins ever. This is Power Plus multibit. Stacy will go into a little bit more detail. And then third, there's a real need for sugar free in the category. And so many of our variants will be available sugar-free. So those are -- these aren't me-too innovations. These are going to be large investments and innovation, and we're going to support that with the marketing that it needs to be supported with. This is our -- in my opinion, this is what's going to help drive that business forward.\nAnd new products. So with that, I'm going to introduce Stacy, who is our new CMO, and she's going to tell you about what we have on tap for 2025.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nHi, everyone. How are you? I am so excited to be here and to talk to you about our new products. So we're going to have a little bit of fun, okay? So let's start first with a review of what has happened in 2024. Matt mentioned that our new products drove 50% of our incremental growth for the company. So the -- what you see here are 3 of our heaviest hitters. So let's talk first about Deep Clean, Win dirt and stink run deep. We want you to clean deeper, and you do this with Deep Clean, and our consumers absolutely did that in 2024. So Deep Clean established that best tier category but also drove incremental growth for the brand.\nSo next up, we have ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets. And this really marries the ARM & HAMMER clean with the convenience as well as the mass pre format of a Power Sheets. So this allowed us to tap into the fastest-growing segment in laundry. And last and certainly not least, we had ARM & HAMMER Hardball. ARM & HAMMER hardball is our technologically advanced hard ball lightweight litter. And so that makes cleaning your liter of breeze.\nSo what I love about this story is, one, there is a tremendous amount of runway with these items. So we're going to definitely invest in growing awareness and trial of these items, so we can drive incremental growth in 2025. But furthermore, we're going to expand on each of these in 2025. So I'm going to take you through some of that, okay?\nAll right. But before we get to our first innovating for 2025, let's take a look at the free and clear segment within the laundry category. This is a huge segment. It's $1.3 billion, and it has absolutely been skyrocketing over the last couple of years. Now we already have some products that fit within this space. But we have identified an opportunity to capture an additional over $20 million in incremental opportunity. So I'm going to talk you through how we're going to do just --\nAll right. So our first new product for 2025 is ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean. This is our free and clear detergent. And so as you would expect, this is catering to the consumer with more of a sensitive skin, and it's certainly free of all of what you would expect. But the real game changer with this item is that we are the only brand with the Skin Safe certification. And this is something that's very meaningful to consumers as it gives them the assurance on product quality and safety. All right.\nSo continuing with that theme, I'd like to introduce you to our ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets in a fragrance-free format. So this is what I call uncompromised clean. So this is dermatologists tested, it's free of dies and perfumes. But the real breakthrough is that this item has 50% more cleaning than the leading value brand because our consumers do not want to compromise their product choices.\nAll right. Last but not least, we have ARM & HAMMER Plant Power. This is our clumping litter. And what's the SCOOP. The SCOOP is this. We are bringing our hard ball technology into the natural segment. And this is why this is such a big deal. Consumers who buy natural, feel that it doesn't do as good of a job to control odors. And that's because many natural litters will use additives. And those additives lead to or brittle clumps. So with our hardball technology, we do not use additives in our natural version for superior clumping. So we really think that this is going to do very well in the natural segment. And I believe if we were to get our fair share, this could be over $30 million for this product launch. All right and that would be incremental.\nSo moving on and Rick some of my thunder here, we are going all in on VITAFUSION, and we have 3 new initiatives plan for 2025. And we really are moving at lightning speed to make this happen. We are first going to introduce a new and improved formula. People, this is going to take taste to the next level. So I want you to imagine a burst of flavor, a velvety smooth texture, this is with innovative heat-resistant formula and softer chew. So not only that, we've also given our multibyte kick with 10% more vitamin A, C and E. So really excited about this launch.\nAll right. What's up next? We've got VITAFUSION Power Plus multi-bit. This is our most advanced formula. We have formulated with 100% daily value or more of 10 essential ingredients. This is more than any other gummy in the market. And then we've supercharged our advanced formula for adult multis with calcium. We've given the women's multi a boost of choline. And last but certainly not least, we've given our men's multi boost of CoQ10. So really excited about getting this item into the marketplace. .\nAll right. This is another teaser slide. This is where we're going next. Sugar is the biggest barrier to prevent users from using gummies. And it's no surprise then to see that sugar-free gummies are really taking off in the last couple of years. So we plan to expand on our sugar-free segment and portfolio of products. So this year, we're launching Power as well as men's multi. When you add those 2 products to our suite of sugar-free items, this is going to represent more than 60% of VITAFUSION sales in a sugar-free variant. Because male mistake, consumers do not want to compromise. We want to give them that same grade update to the taste experience, but in a sugar-free formula. So we know this one is going to go over really well.\nAll right. Switching gears. Rick talked about Hero and how much Hero is a key contributor to growth for Church & Dwight. So it's no surprise. We're going to continue to innovate for Hero. And specifically, I'd like to introduce you to our Hero Mighty patch, body patch. So I may be able to speak to all of you, but body acne is a real pain in the butt. It's also a pain in the chest in the back and so forth. So it makes sense that we launch our largest patch. We call it our LL patch, which is over 3x the size of our next biggest patch, which is the surface patch. But again, the real game changer here is the notches that we've built into this patch. And so with these notches, it's for better adherence to your curved body parts. Also when you move, it adheres to your skin. So it stays put exactly where you want it and still gives you that same absorbing gunk within 6 to 8 hours are known for with our Midypatch, pimple patch. But now we can take care of that back knee and chest knee and so forth. So we're really excited about this item.\nSo the last new product that I have for you, and this is just for the first half of this year is I'd like to introduce you to BATISTE light dry shampoo. Because some days fall for a lighter dry shampoo like day 3 and day 4, but even more importantly, we know that nonusers do you not want white residue or that grid texture that they can get sometimes from a dry shampoo. So I'm going to say to you that this is a triple threat. Our BATISTE light dry shampoo has no white residue, a lighter feel and a beautiful soft, soft fragrance in our Mellon and matches and flavors. So again, consumers don't want to have to compromise. They're going to get the same great superior batted efficacy, but now in a lighter formula. So I'm really excited about this one.\nAll right. So I feel like I could not be leading marketing for Church & Dwight without showing you a spot or 2. So I do have 2 creative spots that are finished, they're ready to go. So you'll be seeing them first before anybody in the marketplace and we are launching BATISTE light dry shampoo with these 2 new spots. So if the people behind the scenes could play the video.\n[Presentation]\nAll right. So I'm going to leave you with this. This was just your teaser for 2025. This is what's launching in the first half of the year. Guys, we have more coming in the back half of the year. And so if I were you might be asking, so what's behind the magic that makes innovation, this innovation? And that, I'm going to say, is my intro for Carlos Linares, who's going to -- who heads up our R&D, and he's going to walk you through just exactly how this innovation comes to you all in the marketplace. So thank you. That's I've got for you.\nOkay. Thanks, Stacy. So a tough act to follow is the marketing and the ads. All right. Yes. So I'm here to talk to you a little bit about how we think about innovation and how we've kind of transformed innovation. And just a quick thing about myself, we haven't been in these forms. But -- so I've been doing R&D innovation for now close to 40 years. A big company, 20 years, Proctor, J&J and then the midsized companies in both Beauty + Home. So I came to Jurgen Day about 7.5 years ago, attracted by the brands, the culture and really kind of an invitation to innovate differently. So my kind of key message is to you as I go through this is, we have transformed how we innovate at Church & Dwight, I'll show you some of that. And it's also a unique approach that we've developed for Church & Dwight. So it is not a smaller version of what you may hear from some of our bigger competitors. It is unique and that's why we think it's sustainable.\nSo let me first talk about what are we doing to create differently? So Rick mentioned this before, we've gone from one innovation source in a sense to 5. And not only are they additive -- really, the challenge here is how do you make them complementary and not competing. And I think that's part of what we do differently at Church & Dwight. So let me kind of give you a couple of different levels of why this complementary connection is very different for us.\nSo when I joined the company, you kind of look at our portfolio and it continues to grow a lot of brands, all diverse brands, a lot of diverse categories. And yet, we're very proud of our revenue per employee. So that's a challenge when you look across the organization. So over time, we looked at it and the highs, how do you flip that model into an advantage into the strength. So our advantage today is we really want to connect a lot of these diverse dots, would you really lead to innovation, better than others do and be in ways that others can't because we know -- personally, I know what the big companies can and can't do, and they really can't break the silos the way that we can because of our size and our culture.\nSo let me give you a kind of a very concrete example. Last year, we introduced BATISTE sweat activated. And how do we get there? So if you go across brands and our categories, odor control, odor reduction is a common consumer need, right, whether it be oral care, launder, women's health, deodorants, you name it. That's a very common need. So rather than attack that individually by R&D department in a sense. We create these platform teams that go across and to rather create scale. So the idea is, hey, if you're looking at odor, talk to each other across the organization, and connect those dots better than others. And when we go talk to the outside world and our partners, we go to them as a company, not as an individual business unit. So BATISTE to a partner to identify some things from technologies that were really existing in other categories. And we were the first to bring them over into hair care. Others could have, but they never did because they're not really talking to each other, right? They're very vertical in how they do it. So that's kind of a bit of our with connecting these diverse competencies. And if you elevate that to these 5 innovation sources, it's kind of the same story. Other people could do this, but in most companies, they've got one kind of dominant work stream for innovation. We've got these and not really competing with complementary. So today, kind of end result is more than 50% of our pipeline is coming from these new innovation sources. So not only we are adding in terms of the contribution for the total pipeline, is actually now much better than it ever was before.\nSo kind of -- once you have a great robust pipeline in a sense, now it's about making choices. So this is our other unique way of looking at our Innovent across our categories, which is this very simple grid around science-based innovation versus business growth. But this is really driving our behavior when we have a good strong portfolio is how do you make them bigger, kind of the are so whether it be choosing where do we make the marketing investments, where do we leverage these across different channels, or what do we leverage across international? It's all about creating the once you find something that you really, really like.\nSo when you step back today, our innovation portfolio is more balanced than it's ever been before across all the types of innovation transformational innovations, which are what we call our blue box, it's the upper right-hand side. Stacy mentioned a few of those. We're very proud of all of those are there, sheets in particular. I've never seen a product where from early development all the way to long, consumers love them all the way through. We've never had a negative reaction to that product. It's really intuitive and loved.\nAnd we have got more coming. So Unfortunately, we're here at the beginning of the year. There are some things that we'll reveal later on in the year because it's too soon, but we've got a very strong pipeline coming.\nAnd the last thing is we've got bigger bets, and that's just kind of the top of this grid here. We've got a lot of products. Stacy has mentioned a few of these. I'm not going to go through the list, and then Mike is going to talk a couple of the a portfolio, too.\nOkay. Let's just talk results. So basically, if you look at all these together, We have now increased and accelerated our incremental net sales from historically was 1% to 1.5% to 1.5% to 2%. And our metric for innovation is in INS, right, incremental net sales. So it is not -- other people measure it differently. This is not gross sales. This is not -- this is post cannibalization. So we're not just looking at replacing our products. Every time we look at innovation, we're looking at, how does it grow and how does it add to the company's growth. That's why, as Rick and Matt mentioned last year, we were contributing half of the growth was pure incremental growth from innovation.\nAnd if you step back and say, okay, when we kind of started this in 2017 or so versus today, given the size of the company, that change from 1%, 1.5% to 2% is really almost a 4x in incremental dollars every year, right, because the company has grown to the towns become bigger every year. As we drive that, we're looking at 4x what it was 7 years ago. So -- and it's also -- it's working, but it's also sustainable, right? We think 2024 is our best ever, 2025 is continue momentum, you said you've heard a couple of these. But we truly believe that the model because of the way it's working for us, we think this is going to continue to contribute long term.\nAnd then one last piece to cover before I hand it over to Mike. Kind of our global footprint. We've got global -- 7 global centers, 4 of which are outside of the U.S. And you have very clear responsibilities. We have no overlap with too lean to have overlapped within our categories. So you see the big flags there are our 7 global centers. And then we also have 6 regional sites, which are kind of smaller ones. And this is really more about putting the basic, whether it be technical folks or regulatory folks to help Mike and his team grow across -- around the world.\nThe next thing kind of back to that connected story, all of these folks now if you look at typical R&D product, packaging development and so forth, regulatory people feeding the global structure, our plants, quality people and our innovation folks for marketing, they're all under one roof, they're one R&D organization. So that's why for us, that power of that connected team, the other thing that probably the big guys can do they're much more vertical. The smaller guys don't have that luxury either. So it's another one of its advantages. Everybody is now marching towards a really coming innovative engine, to be honest.\nSo as we look at this, we feel -- we've transformed R&D and innovation. But given where we're at today, we really feel confident that we're going to continue to do that going forward.\nAnd with that, I'm going to just Mike heading up our international team.\nGood afternoon. My name is Mike I lead our international division as well as our specialty group. And I'm delighted to have Sateesh Chava with us here today. So he will take us through the SPD business in a few moments, so I'll focus on the international story. As you know, our evergreen model for international is 8% organic growth per year. And just to ground everyone, we're about $1.1 billion in size. We operate kind of in two parts, but just under 2/3 of our business is through our subsidiary markets. We have 6 subs that we run Canada, U.K., France, Mexico, Germany and Australia. The rest -- the 37% we run through our GMG business is our Global Markets group. And we operate over 100 countries, and we work through almost 400 valued distributor partners around the globe. Support that with 5 regional offices, one in Shanghai, one in Singapore, one in Mumbai, London and offices continue to go and add resources in order to support the growth that we've got in respective regions.\n2024 is an outstanding year and certainly capped off with a great Q4. Our submarkets grew almost 5%, and our GMG business grew 19%. I'd point to a few things. Certainly, over the last couple of years, we've had increasingly better service levels. That's one key part of it. But more importantly is we've had really consistent growth across the market, strong portfolio management, and we've really leveraged some of our new acquisitions, particularly here on THERABREATH. They've been really strong drivers for us.\nMost importantly, if you look back a couple of years, but throughout the year, we've had really consistent growth across the quarter. So we're seeing broad-based growth across brands, across markets and across quarters. So just again, just to reinforce the momentum and the confidence we have in our plan and our strategy, we've seen some really constant growth, and we see that continuing moving forward.\nIf you look back over the course of the last 10 years, we had a little blip certainly during kind of COVID and some of those kind of tougher years. But kind of ex that, we've had really strong, consistent growth for a very long period of time, and we now have elevated our Evergreen model to 8%, which we're really confident in.\nThis came up earlier on. We have about 18% of our business is international, and that's still a front versus many of our competitors that have been on their international journey a lot longer than we have as a company. So this really gives us the kind of the opportunity and the momentum to keep on. There's a lot of runway, both from a geographic point of view and also from a brand expansion point of view. So we see this not as a bad thing, but actually has a real opportunity for us to grow, and we're growing at a really fast clip.\nI think most notably is our brand portfolio travels extremely well. And we leverage kind of 3 parts. One is we do leverage our U.S. power brands like ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, VITAFUSION, et cetera, those performed strongly across the globe in their respective categories. We also have a unique set of brands that are either internationally only or largely been built out of international. They're mostly OTC and personal care brands like BATISTE, THERABREATH, FEMFRESH, Gravel, et cetera. Those are really high-performing brands in many, many markets. And I think we're doing an increasingly good job of accelerating our acquisitions and getting them to market quicker and having the bigger part of our growth story, here on THERABREATH certainly are the 2 notable ones there.\nSpeaking of Hero, so the last time we were here locked about kind of how quickly we're going to roll out here to over 40 countries. In 2023, we moved to 12 pretty quickly where we could get registrations. We've moved to over 40% in 2024, we'll be in over 50 early in 2025. So this is the fastest we've rolled out a brand, as we've acquired from a U.S. business and taken it globally. And that will become the blueprint and the playbook for us on future acquisitions, but a really great job of getting this to market really quick. We're seeing really strong success as a result.\nSTERIMAR, which we haven't talked a lot about in the past is one of our biggest brands internationally. It's in over 90 countries. This year, we're celebrating our 50th industry, but really high CAGR growth for us. We have a very strong portfolio within the natural nasal hygiene space. This is a really important brand internationally that continues to grow and is a really important part of our portfolio. That's a little bit different than what you'll hear from the U.S. domestic team.\nStacy touched on the importance of innovation in BATISTE. We've certainly benefited that on our active SKUs will sweat and touch activated. They've been really incremental additions to our international portfolio, BATISTE is the world's largest dry shampoo brand, widely distributed and a really strong grower for us. But innovation is a critical part of that and we're seeing some really strong results in all our key markets.\nOXICLEAN has been a really great driver for us and a focus and it's not available in a lot of markets yet, but we'll continue to grow in terms of market expansion. But a 20% growth last year, and that's increasing our CAGR over the last few years. We are the #1 powder brand in both Canada and Japan. And we've just launched into the liquid agent in our Japanese market. So really exciting opportunity for OXICLEAN to continue that momentum. It's got a long runway ahead.\nAnd then finally, from a brand point of view, I just touch on Power Sheets. So we don't have liquid laundry in many of the markets around the world, but Power Sheets is something we have pushed into. It certainly gives us an opportunity to a new segment in many of the world's geographies. We got into 12 marks in 2024. We're going to be in more than 25 by the end of 2025. We're already #1 on Amazon in Mexico, and there's really good momentum where we've got distribution. So this will continue to be a focus, and we'll learn to see what we can do. We'll also pick up a good amount of the innovation pipeline from the U.S. market as well. So really great opportunity to lift and shift and see we can get some momentum in a category. We really haven't played in traditionally on a full scale.\nSo we've got lots of things we invested in and lots of confidence in where we're growing as a brand or as a division there. What I would point to is there's a few things here that's not an exhaustive list, but I think they're notable ones. In the middle of this year, we made an acquisition of a longtime valued partner in Japan, which is the graphical team. We see Japan scaling up over the next number of years as we add additional brands to the portfolio. We've implemented a major global ERP system. So it's easier for us to kind of work with on a global basis. And as we grow our partners and grow with us.\nWe widened our regulatory and IT infrastructure quite significantly, and that is kind of lines up with the regional offices we have around the globe. We've expanded our offices in Panama and Singapore as the team's widened and as the business grows. We touched a little bit on here on THERABREATH, really strong acquisitions for us. I think I would add just leveraging NPD from other markets, those 2 things combined have been a really big part of the growth story.\nAnd lastly, and Matt and Rick touched on it earlier we have put resources from an M&A perspective in both Europe and APAC in order to start to get into the deal flow so we can let international acquisitions, that would be in addition to leveraging any acquisitions we make from a U.S. perspective. So this is, as I say, not an exhaustive list, but a lot of investment, a lot of support going into international growth, and it's certainly responding. We have a long runway ahead.\nSo with that, I will pass over to Surabhi Pokhriyal\n\nSurabhi Pokhriyal\n\nChief Digital Growth Officer",
    "content2": "Good seeing you all today. Introduction Service. I lead all things digital, e-commerce, media and optimization for Church & Dwight. I'm super excited to represent our mythy batch of digital growth team at Church & Dwight. So this is the mythy batch I speak about. This is from our off-site where we were growing where the U.S. Olympic team rose that just tells you the kind of caliber we have not enrolling, but in digital for sure, and we row all in the north star direction of accelerating e-commerce and media for the organization. This is truly industry's best-of-breed talent that we have acquired in the company in recent years.\nLet's talk business. Matt and Rick both alluded to the percentage of our business that is from e-commerce today. It is 21-point-something percent, way up head shoulders and torso, from a lot of our competitors. We are, if not the top 10 style top quartile for sure, in all of CPG in terms of e-commerce. I do want to remind that we are not in the business of calculating how much of our business is from e-commerce. We just are present wherever our consumers present. And especially after COVID, the convenience of buying online, right, whether it is your 2 a.m. melatonin you need with your last miler or your Cat Litter box that needs to be delivered at your front step, the consumer just loves convenience, and we are riding that wave and making sure our products show up wherever they need to show up. So this is that incredible trajectory.\nAs you look at earnings from our retailers, even you will notice a lot of them have started publicly speaking to the amount of growth they see from e-commerce. So you can connect the dots there of where the retailers are getting bulk of their business and where manufacturers like us are make sure, we are getting a lot of our business as well.\nLet's talk share. So we have 7 power brands that you know of. 4 out of the 7 power brands have done incredibly well in 2024, where we are not just maintaining but growing share. I speak to the biggest one in particular, ARM & HAMMER Laundry. Laundry is a big part of our tank. It contributes a ton to the growth of the organization. So we won online share, not just in liquid laundry, but sheets, unit dose and set boosters. And that speaks a lot, right, because laundry is typically considered a category that is meant to succeed in brick-and-mortar. But how we manage here today? And just to qualify, online share does not just mean Amazon share for us, right? It means the t.com, walmart.com, kroger.com, all of that combined is where we are winning in all of these 4 brands.\nAside from the 4 of 7 brands where we are winning in share, 70% of the brands that contribute to 70% of the sales, we are winning in each of them in terms of online share, some notable ones being Zicam and Nir. Terabit, of course, you know how the nominal terabit and Hero have been to our story. Hero has been a digitally native brand, so it's doing much more successful, being much more successful as we gain bigger and bigger brick-and-mortar distribution.\nI'll class -- start this section just by regrounding us in terms of what our approach is, right? Like I said, we are here in this era of connecting content and commerce. You will note a lot of retailers trying to steam into trying to be more social and community builders for the community -- for the consumers at large. But a lot of social channels also have aspiration to be retailers. So the lines are blurring between where is content shown and where is commerce happening. And we want to stay at the intersection of both commerce and content. So that's our priority one.\nSecond, everyone's buzzing AI, I'm surprised I'm the first one on stage speak about AI, but I'm sure you are also following a lot of news on this. We want to look at AI, which is not a hammer looking for a nail, but which is there in terms of what's the business problem or context we are solving and how can AI enable us to that. I'll share a couple of examples, especially in marketing creative. And as you walk the halls, I welcome you guys to have more conversation on that.\nLastly, in terms of e-commerce global foot. Mike spoke clearly, how we are just 18% of our company's business comes from global today, little bit behind where our competition is. And there's a ton of aspiration we have, especially in expanding with respect to e-commerce. I'll share a couple of examples of how our new launches are doing amazingly well in every market that we launched.\nSpeaking to our first pillar with respect to content and commerce, right? You are super familiar how social has become what I call the third shelf of discovery, right? There's a physical shelf in store, there is a digital shelf that you go online and try to shop. And social is, sometimes you're not even trying to shop, but you do a lot of serendipitous to kind of shopping on social. So we are there at that moment of truth where the consumer discovers us while she's doing the endless scroll. We are super intentional about making sure we partner with both macro and key opinion leaders, influencers, who impact how consumers make their decisions today. You see a couple of examples here, be it the Alexa, Edgar or Toni, the Olympic gymnast and a lot of streaming shopping that we have been doing in China for years now.\nThe notable thing to see here is not just that 10 -- over 10 of our brands have the highest number of video views on Tiktok across all categories we operate in, but it's not just about views and followership. A lot of our content has industry-leading engagement rate. And what engagement rate means is the consumers are not just liking and following brands. They are commenting on our posts. They are sharing our posts. They're interacting and building community with us. So that's super meaningful for us because that's the long-term loyalty and intimacy that we want to create with our consumers.\nSecond, we are super careful that we don't want to leave media as a dead end, right? We want to make sure that once the consumer is inspired by seeing an ad spot either on TV or Tiktok, there's an ability for them to shop our products. So we are making sure that over 90% of every media that you see, be it YouTube, Tiktok, Instagram or anywhere else, we will lead you to a card in 1 to 2 clicks if you have the desire to shop our products.\nThis is an example of one of the AI initiatives we are leading. You know there's the concept of aspect ratio, right? You can shop on your 6-inch mobile phone, but you can also shop on your 16-inch television. AI is helping us make sure that creative is conducted in a way that there is less human touch involved and making sure that creative is valid both for the 6-inch screen and the 16-inch screen. So you'll see a couple of snippets here both for ARM & HAMMER. And our partners like Tiktok and Google make sure that it grade us to tell us how we are performing with respect to their expectations on showing up creative really well.\nSo AI is super important, not just in terms of showing up well on social creative, we also know that as the consumers shop for us online, you spend no more than 5 seconds in our kind of, what I call, low consideration categories. So if you land on Amazon or walmart.com page, we have to make sure that the 5 seconds you spend looking for ARM & HAMMER laundry sheets, we make the right first impression you are inspired to add us to the cart. So look at these examples, the score at the bottom left goes from 18.5% to [ 87 ]. All that means is this is AI helping us do eyeball tracking on look-a-like audiences to make sure that creative we put out has the maximum eyeballs on it in that 5-second time on the retailer And has done wonders for us because the more the creative is sticky, the higher chances are that the consumer converts and buys a product.\nFinally, speaking to the global front, Mike spoke eloquently to it. THERABREATH, mighty patch, Hero and Power Sheets have done a lot for us. These are what I call category disruptors and even category creators. We launched them in markets where there were no sheet existed and no acne patch has existed. And within 6 to 12 months, they ranked #1 spot in several online retailers. THERABREATH you'll notice an interesting retailer here. Not many might be familiar, but Olive Young in Korea is the #1 beauty retailer where THERABREATH quickly guarded a spot one. Similarly, Mighty pads across France, Germany, Mexico became #1 really, really quickly. So our products travel well, literally, quite literally.\nFinally, I'll wrap it up by saying our pace of growth on digital has been quite phenomenal industry-leading truly, but we are very focused on being clear on where to play and how to win on that. We have industry-leading e-commerce growth, but we are in Asian in true form making it as profitable as we can. So we are very choiceful about what we sell online, when we sell online and where we sell online. We have unprecedented online market share today, and we are on track to keep growing it.\nWe are also super conscious about best ROI on our media spend. I may not have mentioned, but about 82% of our marketing dollars today are digital media, which is why you see all the media and we struggle to give you TV -- print spot that we used to have back in the past. So we have to print them especially for these kind of events. So we have to make sure that our retail -- our media dollars stretch the highest, so the return on investment of that is super critical for us.\nIn terms of category leadership and digital penetration, like I said, having rapid market launches like we did for Hero, THERABREATH and Sheets is critical and launching them online first, gives us early dips into what the consumer is feeling and gives us an opportunity to tweak them as needed as we do broader brick and motor on those markets.\nWe'll do a lot more on AI and technology, both in martech and ad tech and we lean on both large and small third-party technology partnerships, and that's one big area of impetus for us in the coming years. As saying the best way to predict the future is to create it, and we are hard at it. Along those lines, there's a big business pivot we have in Specialty Products division, and I welcome Sateesh Chava to share more on that turnaround story. Thank you.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. My name is Sateesh. I'm the leader for our Specialty Products division. It's really my honor and excitement to share with you the B2B arm of the company. Because for many of you, maybe a question, why does a CPG company even have SPD? And I want to show you what we are doing and how we are contributing to the growth of the company and how we'll keep growing and be a growth accelerator for the overall organization.\nAs you all know, our Evergreen growth model target is 5%. So let's see how we did last year. Last year as a division, delivered over $300 million in revenue. It split 60% on our Animal Nutrition business and roughly 40% under our Specialty Chemicals division. But let's take a moment to look under the hood, what really is SPD, Specialty Products division.\nSpecialty Products division has 3 businesses. The largest business we have is Animal Nutrition. I can ask you around how do Church & Dwight into Animal Nutrition. It's very, very simple. We sell ARM & HAMMER, Hopefully, all of your user of our ARM & HAMMER, which is baking soda, you see samples here. Chemically, that's sodium bicarbonate. That same sodium bicarbonate, the company started feeding many, many decades ago to dairy cows. It helps with food digestion add better milk production. That's how we entered the world of animal nutrition. Now you fast forward, we are manufacturing both feed supplements, marketing and selling, but also pre- and probiotics. Now there are lots of that say they sell probiotics. So what's special of us?\nWe are truly unique. What we do, you can buy -- if you're running a dairy operations or a poultry farm, you can buy probiotics, everybody will ship you in a bag as the probiotics sample. But what we do -- we go to your operation. Let's say you're running a dairy farm. We'll come to your operation. We collect samples. We send those samples to a lab in Wisconsin, where our scientists analyze those samples, right against our library of probiotics. We have over 80.000 probiotic streams. And then we match that for your unique need and create a truly customized solution, and we sell that under brand. It's a great product that we are very, very proud of, and you're going to see more about it.\nOur second biggest business is performance product. This truly is the core of the company. Performance product is where we sell, again, ARM & HAMMER sodium bicarbonate. Remember the same baking soda I talked about. It's where are we selling it? Instead of selling in the half pound bag or a pound bag that you buy or you may buy at large box chains mid 5 pound, we sell at 50-pound bags, like you see on the screen here, or maybe up to 1,000 kilo, too. We are selling it for large B2B application, industrial, pool, but even life-saving application like hemodialysis. So it's truly amazing what sodium bicarbonate can do and the number of applications it has.\nThe third business that you may not have heard a lot about is our B2B business. This is where we take all the amazing brand the company has Church & Dwight. We customize their packaging, and we sell them for commercial and professional applications in different channels, from -- food services, hospitality. It's small, but I'm confident this business is a growth and you hear a lot more about, not just today but in coming years from us.\nSo SPD. I joined the company roughly 2 years back. And when I came and I analyze the results, as you can see, we have had inconsistent performance. So one of the very first thing we did as a leadership team, we looked at it and we said, what's our strategy going forward. We created a new vision for SPD and we launched a new strategy called SPD reimagine. So I'm very excited to say that if you look at our results from last year, launching the strategy, we had an amazing turnaround. It went from negative 8% in 2023 to plus 7% organic sales growth in 2024.\nNow how did we do that? As I said, we have an amazing group. We have a very talented team of individuals. But we did core pillars in our strategy. First, we divested the nonstrategic noncore assets. I think you heard about we shut down our which was a dairy supplement business in Q1. We exited our safety business in Q2. And what did that do? That allowed us to focus on portfolio optimization. Simply put across the 3 businesses, we could focus on brands that drive profitability and channels where we can do more higher profitable growth, and that really helped us.\nThen next, we shifted just like the broader company you heard from Mike International. International is a huge growth opportunity for SPD. And we are focusing on key countries, both in Eurasia, as well as Latin America. Last year, actually, we have a new sales leader, both for our Latin America business and for our Eurasia build. So we're very excited. The results we are seeing from that. And then we invested in marketing and innovation acceleration, and you all know, what did you invest? Again, when I joined, I was very surprised to see that we are part of a CPG company, and we had no in-house marketing, right? You heard from Stacy our CMO. So just like marketing is core for CPG, it's essential for B2B business also, from both the right brand messaging, brand presuming and doing the omnichannel marketing because the B2B customers are everywhere, just like we are.\nAnd what did that do? Here's a great example. I'm excited to share. We launched our Remember the probiotic I talked about, probotic. We launched 2 new products last year, called them Hatchell and So what are these products? So we have, as I said, over 80,000 strains of probiotics. Our scientists and our technical service team identified one of our poultry operators are having issues where the poultry chicken. They were dealing with billet issue, the Chicken con walk to get the water and the food where it is. And guess what this was called. Before our marketing team, this product was called Cortellis, enterococcus, score, something you allow it to be a PhD to understand what this product is. And this is where we rebranded it and we said, well, what does it do? Move well. Even I get it. When you hear the word move well, it's your chicken can move well. It can have a better quality of life and our production partners, they have higher productivity. These products, Hatch well and Move Well have been great success for us. And we're seeing a lot of engagement for our customers that are helping us grow again with our innovation elation and our portfolio optimization.\nInternational. International, we have a huge runway of growth. Last year, we grew 7% and now international represents 28% of our sales in our Animal Nutrition business. But we have gained -- we are continuing our product registration for our pre and probiotics. So Telia, Salmon, AMAX, our brands. And just as a we added 15 new countries. So we're rapidly expanding where we're going to enter with these countries and keep growing, hopefully, much stronger than the average market growth rate.\nSo to summarize, I'm very excited. Hopefully, you can hear that, that SPD is going to be, as Matt said, perennial growth driver. We're going to keep driving 5% based on spillers. We're focusing on the right brands that will drive the portfolio optimization. International is a key, and we're excited about the growth we are seeing there and building on the whole strong market team that we have created and innovation acceleration. So it's going to really lead the way.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to our CEO, Matt Farrell.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Many of you know, I've been with the company for 18 years. And one thing that's remarkable about Church & Dwight is its consistency, and may wonder, how does that actually happen? And what we're known for is execution. And what that means is we do what we say we're going to do. That's the difference between a company that's consistently successful and one that is not. So you come to -- there's lots of between the sports and business. People roll their eyes when they hear them. One it is true is that the team that have the best players win. So when you're investing, you're investing in people. This Analyst Day, it's the time of year you get a peak under the hood. You see some of the leaders of the company, and they come up and kind of talk. I have the pleasure of working with these people every day.\nWe have exceptional leadership in this company. These are understated people, who we go massive technical skill. And it's not just at the top, it's throughout our plants, it's in our laboratories, it's in our sales offices. It's throughout the company. And a lot of companies will say things like that and you kind of would be checking you're looking at your phone. But if you're trying to figure out why is this company so successful for so long. That's it. It's the culture of this company, the kind of people we attract, the kind of people we recruit to the company. And many of you know, I'm going to be leaving here in April 1, April fool's Day. And -- but this company is in such great shape starting at the top with Rick and the management team that you've seen here today and the strength that we have throughout the company. So it's a good time for me to walk off the field.\nSo I want to move on to how we run the company. If you've owned our stock for a long time, if you can check your for now. But we have 5 operating principles, right? You've heard this before. And that's the thing about Church & Dwight. Many of the things you hear from us, you've heard last year, the year before, you're down here, the stock exchange, you hear it at CAGNY. That's because we have an operating model, and we stick to it, and we execute it. Again, back do you do what you say you're going to do. It's a personal commitment that we feel that a company in to each other. We said this is what we're going to hold off this coming year. So you heard a lot about our brands, about leveraging our brands. We've got great brands around the world. Second thing is friend of the environment. A little bit about that. That's very important to not just to our employees, but it's also important to our consumers. It's important to our retailers. And we have a long heritage, and we're really starting back in the 19th century. You've heard me talk about bird before I'm going to show them in a minute. But I always take a little bit of time to talk about our heritage shares. If you look at early 20th century, we were using recyper. We were the first to take phosphates out of liquid laundry detergent. We've been planting trees since 2017. We pointed millions of trees that takes CO2 out of the atmosphere. Remember all that from fifth grade, right, photosynthesis.\n100% of our global electricity is by green energy. And then we started we signed up for in a we have the projects to take CO2 out of the atmosphere because we use a lot of CO2 when we're making Baking soda. There's one of those bird cards that we put in, in our yellow boxes. And if you -- I don't know if you can read it well, but it is useful birds of America and at the very bottom is for the good of all, do not destroy the birds. And for those of you who are interested, you can still buy these. These are the original bird cards, they are available on eBay. So buy now. This is an advertisement for eBay. I just want to tell you, I know so many of you are very enthusiastic about the ARM & HAMMER brand. This is something we want to look into.\nAll right. ESG, everybody gets measured on ESG. You can see we got great scores consistent with '22, '23, '24. Third thing to talk about is leverage people. We have a really lean shop. We've always had a really lean shop. Why is that important? It's because it forces you to prioritize. They want to work on the stuff that matters. So consequently, we have the highest revenue per employee of any of our peer group. So we got $6 billion in sales. We got 5,500 employees. So we got over $1 million of sales per employee. And as Surabhi took us through, we're world-class when it comes to e-commerce. And we got there because we put our minds to it. We knew we were bottoming a barrel in 2016 and now we're ahead of the pack. We really believe in a simple compensation structure. So everybody kind of knows where they are at all times. We don't get involved in EVA or some of the other -- these complicated esoteric measurements, the straight up net revenue, gross margin, cash, EPS and strategic initiatives, 20% each. And it's unusual for a company to have gross margin as part of incentive comp.\nWhat that does is promote financial literacy. When it's going to hit your pocket book, you're going to say, hey, what is gross margin, how do we get a and that's just going to galvanize as a company. And the ways we get it, good to great. We like to joke within the company is the book everybody has heard of, but nobody's read, but that is the name of our continuous improvement program.\nSupply chain is a bedrock when it comes to finding ways to save money new products. We try to launch new products that have a higher gross margin than the ones they're replacing. And then when we buy a business, we try to find a expand our gross margins as well.\nNow you've heard us talk about being asset-light. That's very, very true. We want to buy businesses that don't have plants. But for a long period of time, our average CapEx as a percentage of sales is 2%. And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is about -- it's close to 30% of our finished products right now are made by third parties. So that also helps continue to be asset light.\nAnd finally, leverage acquisitions. You do those first 4 right, you get good returns. If you're good at acquisitions, which we are, which Rick took you through earlier, we're good at identifying targeting, acquiring and integrating. And you can blow it on any one of those 3. You pay too much, we don't integrate it, a disaster can happen.\nAll right. You've seen this slide before, long history, a bit of a drought '23, '24, but not for lack of trying, and now Rick's going to come up and take you through the 2025 outlook .\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. So let's turn to 2025 outlook. We announced today that we're going to have a top line expectation of 3% to 4% organic, 25 basis points of gross margin expansion. You'll hear we have a little bit higher than historical inflation, more like 3% versus 2%. Marketing 11% plus, probably in the range of 11% to 11.4%. So it's incremental because we're driving share gains, leverage SG&A and 7% to 8% EPS growth. And we expect to generate, again, $1.1 billion or so -- CFO.\nSo we have a long track record of this growth, 2.5% to 3.5% is our outlook. But if you look at the track record, it's 6%. Why is that? It's M&A? We historically also do M&A.\nOrganically, expectations 3 or 4, 10-year average is 4%. And that 3% to 4% is largely volume driven, and that's the case for not just 1 year or 2 years, but for over a decade, it's our history. It's volume-driven growth. I mentioned this earlier, gross margin expansion in 2025, 25 basis points. It gets us right back to 2019 levels. We believe we have more room to run as we have this productivity program that's a muscle, similar to how Carlos described the NPD innovation process. We have -- it's analogous to how we do productivity. And we also have some fast-growing acquisitions that have higher than corporate margins.\nSpeaking of margin, I'll talk about 2025 really quick. Volume and mix largely give you a little of a benefit of 30 basis points is our expectation, a drag of 150 basis points and then said by a large degree to productivity. That's what gets us to the 25 of expansion. And costs, I mentioned this earlier, but it's probably 40% or so from a commodity-based perspective, and that's ethylene and resins are up and natural gas is up. But more so, it's also depreciation for new capacity. It's putting in a new 3PL in the Northeast. It's other higher cost for our partners, co-packers, as Matt mentioned.\nMarketing spend, 11% plus, is the expectation in 2025. And then SG&A is leverage. Leverage while making events to for what matters in terms of building capabilities, e-com, international. And then we've had a long track record of high single-digit or even double-digit EPS growth, and we expect 7%, 9% or 7% to 8% in 2025.\nAnd we put this in the release as well. There is some phasing, right? We're supporting some innovation with market in the front of the year. We have a little bit higher revenue growth in the back part of the year. And so that's why there's a little bit more fees growth in the second half.\nThis is my favorite slide as a CFO and it's probably still going to be one of the favorite slides in the future. And why is that? It enables us to do a lot of things. 115% free cash flow conversion means we can go do capital allocation, right? Cash flow matters more than most. And we get there a few different ways, but one of the ways we get there is we have a strong, tight way we manage working capital. We've gone from 52 days down into the 20s. We expect this to further improve as we look forward. And our balance sheet has never been stronger, 1.5x debt to EBITDA. And that means we have -- this is the highest number we've ever had on this page, too, over $6 billion of firepower. This is dry powder do M&A. This is fantastic. And this leads to whether is our use of free cash flow. What's our capital allocation? Well, number one is M&A. Because we haven't done a deal in the last 12 months or 24 months, doesn't mean we're not in really hard at looking at deals. And I would tell you that the ELT spends a lot of their time looking for the right deal. The number one value-creating opportunity is looking for the next business or brand to buy, but we're going to be picky and fussy as we go through that process. Number two is CapEx. Number three is NPD. Number four is debt reduction, although that's hard to do when you've prepaid all your debt. And so now we just have fixed debt. And so we're waiting for a great acquisition to go borrow some more 1 day and then return cash to shareholders.\nMatt covered this. This is -- we're not a capital-intensive company. This matters when you look at free cash flow conversion. And then finally, dividend increase, a long track record. I don't know what's longer than long, but 124 years is decades, a century or more of paying a dividend, credibility, consistency. That's what Church & Dwight is nowhere.\nNow before I ask everybody to come up, I do want to acknowledge that we have a huge amount of confidence in our future, okay? And you heard it from each person today. whether it was Mike on International, Surabhi on Digital, I talked to the U.S. business, I talked about our outlook for M&A. And the nuance there is just not in the U.S. We're looking at M&A both domestically and international. A year ago, when Brian was here who happens to be sick today, we told you that his team increased by 300%, right? So he went from 1 person to 4 people. So we have people in Europe. We have people in Singapore and Asia. So the focus on live and well.\nI also want to acknowledge Matt. And Matt has been here for 18 years, right? And we just did a quick montage of New York Stock Exchange. He embodies the culture of this company, okay? We are where we are because of Matt Farrell to a large degree. Like you just heard him talk about people, you just talked -- heard him talk about leadership. We are unique and different and Matt is a big reason why.\nHere's a quick look back. So management company back in 2006, a $2 billion revenue company. Now it's a $6 billion on. Market cap was $3 billion. Now we're $26 billion. But more than that, he's added capabilities, right? Capabilities like e-com, like pricing, things that we do that we take for granted. One of the great things about our culture, we're not insular. If there's something that we see that we think we can go after. We're going to run as fast as we can with speed and urgency in order to execute it. A lot of that, again, Matt certainly did that.\nSo with that, I'll invite everybody else up, and we'll take questions."

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding other things the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, who's our CFO and Head of Business Operations. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. So Q2 was another solid quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported sales growth was 3.9%, which beat our outlook of 3.5 and that was thanks to strong results across the board from domestic international and Specialty Products.\nOrganic sales grew 4.7%, which exceeded our 4% Q2 outlook with volume accounting for a very healthy 3.5% of our growth. Adjusted gross margin expanded 150 basis points. At the same time, we increased marketing spending, and we gained market share in the majority of our categories. Adjusted EPS was $0.93, which was $0.10 higher than our $0.83 outlook. Now as a quality quarter, and Rick will take you through that later, the results were driven by higher-than-expected sales growth and gross margin expansion.\nAnd we continue to grow in the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching 21.2%. Now I'm going to turn my comments to each of the 3 businesses. First up is the U.S. consumer business with 3.8% organic sales growth. Volume growth was 3.3%, making this the fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth in the U.S. As you read in the release, Church & Dwight had the highest dollar consumption growth among our top 10 peers and 5 of our 7 power brands gained market share in the quarter with a few hitting all-time highs.\nNow let's look at a few important categories in the U.S. Innovation is a big contributor to our success this year. And as I comment on the categories, I'll highlight the success of our new product launches. I'm going to start with laundry detergent. So ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent consumption outpaced the 1.6% category growth and achieved an all-time high record share in the quarter of 14.8%, which is up 20 bps. ARM & HAMMER Unit Dose, ARM & HAMMER scent boosters and extra liquid laundry brand, all grew faster than their categories and also grew share in the quarter.\nRegarding new products, we have launched 2 new products into the detergent category, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean and ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets, the first, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean is our most premium laundry detergent entering the mid-tier of liquid laundry. ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean accounted for 40% of ARM & HAMMER's liquid laundry detergent consumption growth in the quarter and is highly incremental to the ARM & HAMMER franchise.\nThe second new product is ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets which is a laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER was the first major brand to offer this new unit dose form in the U.S. the last year in August. Since expanding the launch of this product into bricks-and-mortar retailers this year, we have seen high consumer interest in the form. Our ARM & HAMMER Power sheets has proven to be highly incremental to both the sheets category and the total laundry detergent category, and we are seeing repeat rates increase. We feel great about the future prospects for this product and form.\nNow I'm going to talk about Litter. ARM & HAMMER Litter grew consumption 6% in Q2, which was almost double the category growth. Our new lightweight ARM & HAMMER Hardball Clumping Litter is outperforming our expectations as our share of the lightweight category has grown from 4.5% in Q1 to 8.2% in Q2. This is important because lightweight accounts for 16% of the Clumping Litter level category, and so we expect Hardball to continue to grow in the coming quarters.\nTurning to Personal Care. The gummy vitamins business continued to be a drag on the total company organic growth in Q2. The gummy vitamin category declined 1.9% in Q2, which is an improvement from the 5% category decline in the past 2 quarters. The bad news is our consumption was down even greater. We were down 10.9%. We continue to move forward with our plan to stabilize our gummy business through new packaging, upgraded formulas to improve the consumer experience, new forms like chewables and greater marketing investments that we've talked about with you in the past.\nHowever, the improvement is taking much longer than we anticipated. Next up is BATISTE. BATISTE continues to strong consumption growth with consumption up 14.5% in Q2, growing share to 47%. BATISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo and innovation is very important to the success of this brand. So listen to this. This year, we launched BATISTE Sweat activated and BATISTE Touch Activated dry shampoos. These products are bringing new users to the category. And already, these 2 new products account for a 2% share of dry shampoo and Sweat Activated is the #1 new product in the category.\nOver in mouthwash, THERABREATH continues to perform extremely well. THERABREATH is the #1 alcohol-free mouthwash and the #3 brand in [ total mouthwash ] with a 17% share. This year, THERABREATH entered the antiseptic segment of the category with the launch of TheraBreath Deep Clean Oral Rinse.\nIt's important to note that antiseptic represents 30% of the $2 billion mouthwash category, and our launch into antiseptics accounted for 100 basis points of our 400 basis point year-over-year market share gain in total mouthwash. So that's a great indicator future of the antiseptic launch. HERO continues to drive the majority of growth in the acne category and has grown to become the #1 brand in the acne category with a 20% share. HERO continues to launch innovative solutions and patches combined with adjacent consumer needs. An example would be the recently launched Dissolve Away Daily Cleansing Balm.\nNow a few comments about private label. Regarding private label, the good news is our weighted average private label exposure is relatively stable. We have seen notable private label share gains in gummy vitamins, where private label gained 2 share points, achieving a 16.7% share, which is back to pre-COVID historical highs. This has also contributed to our difficulties in that business. In the Litter category, private label share has increased sequentially in the last few quarters from 13.1% in Q4, 13.3% in Q1 and 13.5% in Q2.\nSo current levels are historical highs. The good news is that it's a different story for us as ARM & HAMMER Litter continues to gain share in spite of the private label strength. I'll close my comments on the U.S. by saying that although consumption has been strong through the first half of the year, we did experience a slowdown in June and July. And for context, and you read this in the release, our categories averaged 4.5% dollar consumption growth through May of this year.\nBut since then, it has been closer to 2%. Now this is not entirely a surprise as we expected a deceleration as year-over-year pricing rolled off. However, unit consumption also saw a deceleration from the first 5 months to what we saw in June and July. So it appears that the consumer maybe getting extended and is making choices around spending habits. While we have only seen this trend for the last couple of months, we expect that categories are likely to grow at a slower pace than we experienced in the first half of the year.\nAnd as you know, our balanced portfolio of value and premium offerings performs, I should say, is well suited to changes in consumer buying patterns. Turning now to international and Specialty Products. Our international business delivered organic growth of 9.3% in Q2. This was driven by strong growth in the subsidiaries as well as our Global Markets Group, and just a few call outs. We had strong growth in Canada, Mexico, Germany and our Global Markets Group. And finally, Specialty Products. Organic sales increased 3.9% and that's 2 quarters of solid organic growth for this business.\nWe're confident that this division will achieve a 5% organic sales growth this year, which would hit our evergreen growth target. I want to wrap up my comments by reiterating that the company is performing well, all 3 divisions delivering strong growth. I want to thank all the Church & Dwighters out there for doing such a great job each and every day. And now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some more color around the quarter and full year outlook.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.93, up 1.1% from the prior year. The $0.93 was better than our $0.83 outlook and is a high-quality beat, primarily driven from higher-than-expected sales growth and gross margin expansion. We'll walk through the details of the P&L. But this was a strong quarter with 8% growth of profit before tax versus the prior year, excluding the tariff benefit.\nOther important highlight for the quarter was the majority of our brands gained share. Reported revenue was up 3.9% and organic sales was up 4.7%. Organic sales was driven by volume of 3.5% and positive price/mix of 1.2%. Volume was the primary driver of organic growth, and we expect volume growth to continue for the rest of the year. And as Matt mentioned earlier, this makes 4 consecutive quarters of volume growth.\nOur second quarter gross margin was 47.1%, a 320 basis point increase from a year ago, reflected a onetime benefit on a favorable ruling and rebate related to historical tariff payments. Excluding this impact, adjusted gross margin increased 150 basis points due to productivity, volume and mix, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge.\nGross margin components are as follows: positive 80 basis points impact from price volume/mix and a positive 120 basis points from productivity. This was partially offset by a 10 basis point drag from currency and a 40 basis point drag from inflation. Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $20.2 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 10.1% or 100 basis points higher than Q2 of last year and led to share gains.\nFor SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A increased 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to international R&D and costs related to the GRAPHICO acquisition. Other expense decreased by $7.8 million, primarily due to lower outstanding debt and higher interest income. For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 17.9% in 2023, which is significantly higher than a year ago due to a high level of stock options exercised in Q2 of '23.\nWe continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%. And now to cash. For the first 6 months of 2024, cash from operating activities was $499 million, almost $500 million, a decrease of $9 million with higher cash earnings offset by higher working capital. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately [ $1.08 ] billion. Capital expenditures for the first 6 months was $76.6 million, a $13.4 million increase from the prior year as capacity expansion projects proceeded as planned.\nWe expect 2024 CapEx of approximately $180 million as we complete the majority of those investments that were initiated in 2023, and we continue to expect CapEx to return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025 and beyond. And now for the full year outlook, as Matt mentioned, strong financial performance in the first half of the year and strong categories and share gains. As we move into the second half, consumption growth has moderated in many categories as the consumer remains under pressure.\nConsequently, we are tightening our organic revenue outlook and now expect or getting sales growth to be approximately 4%, at the low end of our prior 4% to 5% range. Reported sales growth is expected to be approximately 3.5%, which also reflects a drag from currency and the impact from divestitures. We continue to expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of 8% to 9% growth, but now at the low end of the range.\nIn round numbers, the sales call down would normally be offset by the gross margin raise at the EPS line. However, we have 2 other factors for the change. Number one, as you saw in the release, full year SG&A is now expected to increase as a result of higher spend for GRAPHICO. That drag went from $0.01 to $0.02 as we make incremental investments. And then number two is dry powder in the event categories get more promotional in the second half.\nTurning to gross margin. We now expect expansion of approximately 100 to 110 basis points, up from our previous outlook of 75 basis points of expansion. We continue to expect an increase in manufacturing costs to be more than offset through productivity, mix and higher volume. We continue to expect marketing as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11% as we continue to grow share across many of our brands.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.",

Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call up for questions.\nQ1 was another solid quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported sales growth was 5.1%, beating our outlook of 4%, thanks to stronger results across the board from domestic, international and specialty products. Organic sales grew 5.2%, which exceeded our 4% Q1 outlook with volume accounting for a very healthy 70% of our growth.\nGross margin expanded 220 basis points. At the same time, we increased marketing spending in the quarter and gained market share in the majority of our categories. Adjusted EPS was $0.96, which was $0.11 higher than our $0.85 outlook. The results were driven by higher-than-expected sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate.\nWe continue to grow in the online class of trade with online sales as a percentage of global sales now reaching 20.5%. In March, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire GRAPHICO, our Japanese distributor for approximately $35 million. We expect the acquisition to close later this year. GRAPHICO's annual sales are approximately $38 million. The business is based in Tokyo and has 59 employees.\nSince 2008, GRAPHICO has partnered with Church & Dwight and driven OXICLEAN to be the #1 powder prewash additive in Japan. The acquisition is expected to contribute to greater expansion of our business in Japan and the greater APAC region.\nWe intend to leverage the capabilities of the graphical team to bring additional Church & Dwight brands to Japanese consumers. Now I'm going to turn my comments to each of the 3 businesses. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business had 4.3% organic sales growth, 3.3% of that was volume driven, making this the third consecutive quarter of U.S. volume growth.\nFive of our 7 power brands gained market share in the quarter and private label market share in our categories remained relatively stable. Now let's look at a few important categories in the U.S., starting with laundry. ARM & HAMMER liquid large detergent consumption was flat while the category grew 2%. Many of you may recall, we had pulled back on promotional activity in Q4, and that continued into early Q1.\nAs our promotional activity normalized, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry saw share gains late in the quarter and the brand has continued to perform well in April. Now elsewhere in laundry, ARM & HAMMER unit dose and ARM & HAMMER scent boosters both grew faster than their categories and grew share in the quarter. Our extra liquid laundry brand, which is our extreme value offering grew consumption 6.3% and increased market share to 3.8%.\nRegarding new products, we have launched 2 new products into the detergent category, ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean and ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets. The first ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean is our most premium ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent entering the mid-tier of liquid laundry and delivering a superior claim at a price consumers can afford.\nThe second new product is ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets laundry detergent, which is launched -- which was launched online in August of 2023. ARM & HAMMER was the first major brand to offer this new unit dose form in the U.S. Now due to its online success, Power Sheets is now available in select brick-and-mortar retailers. Power Sheets continues to grow online. It now has 9,000 reviews with a 4.5 rating, and both Deep Clean and Power Sheets are off to a great start in 2024, and we're excited about the early results we are seeing.\nNow over in Litter. ARM & HAMMER litter grew consumption 5% in Q1, which was in line with category growth. Our new lightweight ARM & HAMMER HardBall clumping litter is now expanding nationally after a successful in-market test in 2023. We expect this new letter to help ARM & HAMMER capture a greater share of the lightweight litter category.\nTo give you a couple of facts here, Lightweight Litter today accounts for 16% of the clumping litter category. Our share of lightweight clumping litter has grown from 4% to 6% since year-end 2023, but that compares to our 29% share in regular weight litter. So still a long way to go. Turning to Personal Care BATISTE continues to see strong consumption growth with consumption up 19% in Q1, growing share to 47.5%.\nBATISTE continues to be the global leader in dry shampoo. We are meeting consumers' desire for long-lasting results with the launch of BATISTE sweat-activated and BATISTE touch-activated dry shampoos. And so far, consumers are posting excellent reviews for both of these new innovations.\nNow our mouthwash. THERABREATH mouthwash and HERO continue to perform extremely well. THERABREATH is the #1 alcohol-free mouthwash brand and is now the #3 brand in total mouthwash with a 16% share. THERABREATH recently entered the antiseptic segment of the category with the launch of THERABREATH deep clean oral rents, which represents 30% of the category.\nHERO continues to drive the majority of growth in the acne category and has grown to become the #1 brand in the larger acne category with 19% share. HERO continues to launch innovative solutions and patches combined with adjacent consumer needs, such as the recently launched Dissolve Away daily cleansing bomb.\nNow there are 2 businesses, gummy vitamins and WATERPIK that created a drag on total company organic growth in Q1. First, WATERPIK. The good news for WATERPIK is consumption for our water flosser business is healthy. However, [ flush ] of shipments were affected by retailer inventory adjustments in the first quarter. This, combined with lower showerhead consumption accounted for a 1% negative drag on organic revenue growth but we expect this to be transient.\nThe second is gummies, which also created a 1% drag. The gummy vitamin category declined 5% in Q1, which was actually worse than our expectations for the category and our consumption was down even greater, down 12%. We continue to move forward with our plans to stabilize our vitamin business through changes, through packaging, messaging and greater marketing investments that we've talked about with you in the past.\nI will close my comments on the U.S. by saying that overcoming the drag from these businesses still -- and still posting a 5% organic sales growth for total company, just illuminates the strength of our portfolio.\nTurning now to international and Specialty Products. Our international business delivered organic growth of 8.8% in Q1. This was driven by strong growth in the subsidiaries, just a few callouts, especially Mexico, Germany, U.K. and France. And we also had growth from our Global Markets Group. And finally, Specialty Products. Specialty Products organic sales increased 7.2% primarily due to record sales in our Eurasia business as SPD continues to expand globally.\nI want to wrap up my remarks by reiterating that the company is performing well with all 3 divisions delivering strong growth. And I want to thank our global employees for their great efforts each and every day. Now we rarely raise our full year outlook. Now we rarely raise our full year outlook after only 1 quarter. But given our fast start, we raised our outlook for gross margin and EPS growth, and we have confidence in our new full year forecast.\nAnd now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some more color around the quarter.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.96, up 12.9% from the prior year. The $0.96 was better than our $0.85 outlook, primarily driven from higher-than-expected sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate. Reported revenue was up 5.1%, and organic sales were up 5.2%. Organic sales were driven by volume of 3.7% and positive product mix and pricing of 1.5%. 70% of our organic growth was volume driven. And as Matt mentioned earlier, this makes 3 consecutive quarters of U.S. volume growth.\nOur first quarter gross margin was 45.7%, a 220 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to productivity, volume, mix and pricing, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs. Let me walk you through the Q1 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive [ 130 ] basis points impact from price volume mix and a positive [ 130 ] basis points from productivity. This was partially offset by 10 basis points from currency and 30 basis points from inflation.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was up $29.7 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 10.1% or 150 basis points higher than Q1 of last year and led to share gains. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $20.9 million, a $2.2 million decrease primarily due to lower outstanding debt and higher interest income. We now expect other expense for 2024 to be approximately $80 million.\nFor income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 19.9% compared to 24.4% in 2023, a decrease of 450 basis points due to a high level of stock option exercise in Q1 of 2024. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%. And net of cash. For the first 3 months of 2024, cash from operating activities increased to $263 million, a decrease of $10.1 million with higher cash earnings, offset by higher working capital.\nWe now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1.050 billion, up slightly from our previous $1 billion outlook. Capital expenditures for the first 3 months were $46.3 million, a $21 million increase from the prior year as capacity expansion projects proceed as planned. We expect 2024 CapEx of approximately $180 million as we complete the major capacity investments that were initiated in 2023, and we expect capital spending to return to historical levels of 2% of sales in 2025.\nAnd now for the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year 2024 reported an organic sales growth to be approximately 4% to 5%. We now expect full year EPS in the range of 8% to 9% growth. This is up from our previous 7% to 9%. And is inclusive of costs related to the exit of the MEGALAC business as well as graphical transaction costs. We now expect full year gross margin to expand approximately 75 basis points, up from a previous range of 50 to 75 basis points.\nGiven our outstanding Q1 margin expansion of 220 bps, this outlook implies moderate gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect an increase in manufacturing costs to be more than offset through productivity, mix, higher volume and carryover pricing. We continue to expect marketing as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11%.\nSG&A is now expected to be flat as a percentage of net sales compared to 2023, reflecting the investments we are making in our international and e-commerce infrastructure and costs related to the GRAPHICO acquisition Matt discussed earlier.\nFor Q2, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of approximately 3.5%. Organic sales growth of approximately 4%. We had a really strong April from a consumption perspective. So some might be expecting a higher organic growth outlook. Our 4% outlook reflects higher coupons and trade promotion in support of new products. We're fully lapping 2023 price increases and more lapping a year ago distribution gains for HERO.\nMoving on to the rest of the P&L. We expect moderate gross margin expansion in the quarter in Q2 as we have less of an impact from carryover pricing. Increased marketing spending to support our innovation pipeline, higher SG&A expense and a significantly higher tax rate of 24% compared to the prior year of 17.9%, which benefited from a high level of stock option exercises. This represents a roughly $0.07 drag on EPS. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.83 per share, down 10% versus last year adjusted Q2 EPS.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.",

    "content": "Q4 2023 Church & Dwight Co Inc Earnings Call & Investor Day\n\nQ4 2023 Church & Dwight Co Inc Earnings Call & Investor Day\n\nCHDNYSEFEB 2, 12:00 PM\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nIt's a little bit like the Academy Awards. We're going to be hearing cutlery and clinking of plates and whatnot. All right. Thank you. Welcome, everybody. This is our 2024 Analyst Day, and we got all of our sell-side analyst friends in the room and lots of major shareholders. So let's begin.\nWe have a safe harbor statement. Encourage everybody to read that after class. And I'm going to start out with who's with us here today. We have virtually the entire management team, one of the best-looking management teams in CPG. I'm sure you'll agree. And we've got kind of a packed agenda. I won't read it to you, but got a number of people coming up, are going to talk to you today about financials, our new products, digital and also our international story.\nSo here's a quick look back to 2023. So we had a great year for reported and also organic growth, our reported 9% and organic 5%. And we had gross margin expansion of 220 basis points. You can hold the applause for a minute. We had all-time high shares in a lot of our major brands, share gains. Marketing spending historically has been around 11%. We almost got all the way back to 10.9%. And we generated $1 billion in cash from operations. And finally, as you know, we've been investing in capacity for laundry, litter and vitamins and also adding to the capabilities of the company.\nAnd here's our TSR. We show this to you every year, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, especially what matters to our shareholders. 2022 was an abysmal year for us and we've recovered 2023. And we got a lot of confidence going forward, which you're going to walk out of the room here today thinking this is that. We've got a lot of confidence in our ability to grow in the U.S. You see that we tweaked our evergreen model in our press release, so we're expecting 3% growth in the future in the U.S. International, we've tweaked that there to say we expect 8% growth internationally going forward.\nWe have a wonderful lineup of new products in 2024, but we've been consistent in our innovation for many, many years. We're becoming more and more digitally savvy. So one of the markers for that would be what percentage of your sales is online? And the answer is 20% of our sales is purchased online. That's over $1 billion in sales. The new evergreen model is very healthy. I'm sure you're going to leave here today thinking that. We've got really strong fundamentals going forward.\nSo who are we? We're a $6 billion company, largely U.S. You see 78% domestic and 17% international. Specialty Products is our original business from back in the 1840s. Historically, we've talked to you about 14 power brands, and those 14 power brands account for 85% of our revenues and profits. But today, as you saw under our release, in the future, we're going to narrow our communication to investors and shareholders and analysts to 7 of those 14. And those 7 are ones that are in larger categories, and we also believe they have a lot of potential for our global growth.\nSo those are the 7, THERABREATH, VITAFUSION, HERO, of course, ARM & HAMMER, our biggest brand, WATERPIK, BATISTE, and OXICLEAN. And they account for 70% of our revenues and profits. So I'm going to run through what our winning formula is. First off is we have a very balanced and diversified business. We have low private label exposure, great innovation as you're going to see here today, and we are an acquisitive company. For many, many years, we've said the highest and best use of our cash flow is to buy brands.\nAll right. Here's the balance. We're pretty much 50-50 between household and personal care. As far as value versus premium, historically, it's been 40-60 between value and premium because of the growth of THERABREATH and HERO that shifted a little bit, but it's still pretty solidly around 40-60. Low private label exposure, this is on a weighted average basis, it's around 12%, and it's been like that for many, many years. Category-leading innovation. Barry Bruno is going to take you through a lot of the innovation group, things we're launching in 2024.\nAnd we have a long history of acquisitions. So if you went back to 2004, we had $1.5 billion in sales, and now we almost have $6 billion in sales in 2023. And our acquisition criteria is very specific so we're very fussy about what we're going to buy. They have to be #1 or #2 brands, they need to have high-growth, high-margin brands, fast-moving consumables, asset light. We have to be able to bring something to the party and leverage our supply chain, our internal capabilities, and they have to have a long-term sustainable competitive advantage.\nAll right. So we've got 7 of those power brands today and more to come. And here's our -- I'm just going to wrap it up here just to remind you. Balanced portfolio, I think it's really key to the long-term success of this company. Low private label exposure. We don't have new exposure that some of our peers do. Innovation is the reason why our brands are so successful and the reason why our brand equity grows year-over-year. And finally, we're an acquisitive company and we do it well. But I'm going to bring up Rick now to take you through the financials.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to talk to you about the quarter, the full year, which we finished really strongly, and also our outlook and our evolved evergreen model. So first, the quarter. Our outlook was 5% from a net sales growth perspective. It was 4% organically. We came in at 6.4% and 5.3%, so just better in the top line all around. Gross margin, we just had expansion. We came in at 260 basis points expanding versus a year ago. And then EPS was up. So just green arrows all the way.\nFor the full year, similar story. We had 9% as an outlook for the top line and 5% for organic. We came in at 9.2% and 5.3%. Gross margin, we had expected to be up [ 2 10 ], we were actually up [ 2 20 ], as Matt mentioned. And then EPS reported and adjusted are both better than we expected. Cash flow, $1 billion was our outlook and we came in at $1,030,000,000 so just strong cash flow all the way around.\nAll right, so just I'm going to spend some time on the evergreen model. So for many, many years, we've been going through, and I begin and end almost all my presentations with the evergreen model because that is the fact, the backdrop for the company. Organic net sales of 3%, gross margin expansion of 25 basis points, flat percentage for marketing higher dollars, and then we leveraged SG&A by [ 25 ] and that's how we got to [ 50 ], and that led to 8% EPS growth. And that's what we've been saying year after year after year. And we're evolving it today. And we're going to say 4%.\nFor the last 10 years, if you look back at our history, we've been growing 4%. But we're saying we have confidence in the future and we're going to continue to grow at 4%. I'll get into that detail in a second. But the divisions would be 3% domestic, [ 8% ] international and 5% for SPD. Gross margin, we also think that this is the time that we are accelerating on productivity. Inflation is starting to moderate, and we have some fast-growing acquisitions that we've done that are helping, that are tailwinds to gross margin. Marketing, same story, flat percentage but higher dollars. And as we grow faster, that just means we're going to invest even more dollars in marketing to help gain share and to help grow our brands.\nSG&A we're going to leverage, maybe not as much as in the past but still leverage. And in that number, we're now investing largely behind international and largely behind e-com, and we'll get into that detail in a second, too. So operating margin still expands 50 basis points and industry-leading growth of 8%. That's the new model.\nSo let's just go through the detail a little bit on organic. What gives us confidence? Well, we're in fast-growing categories, and Barry will show you, as we talk about those 7, they're extremely fast growing. We want to take share and we do that through marketing, through innovation, and we've done that year after year after year. THERABREATH and HERO, recent acquisitions, are fast-growing and international growth is accelerating to 8%. On the gross margin side, again, productivity is outpacing inflation. We have higher-margin acquisitions on the marketing side, and is going to talk about it. We're getting good ROIs in our spend. That transition is helping. And then we have higher dollars as we grow the top line.\nAnd then SG&A, we're putting in systems all over the world. Put in a China ERP system, we're putting in an ERP system for our GMG business based out of Europe. All these investments are embedded in our numbers. We also are building capabilities around the world, regulatory, back office to support this fast-growing business called GMG within our international. And then analytics and e-commerce, those are capabilities we want to build.\nOkay, moving to 2024. So I just talked to the new evergreen model. The outlook is actually a step-up from that. The outlook is 4% to 5% on the top line. It's 4% to 5% organically, excluding MEGALAC, excluding currency. Gross margin up 50 to 75 basis points, so to step up again from our evergreen model. SG&A is leverage, operating profit expansion is higher than our evergreen model, [ 60 to 80 ] Tax rate is a little bit higher and EPS growth of 7% to 9%, and our cash from operations is $1 billion-plus.\nNow we do have some timing within our EPS outlook. So the first half is essentially flat, and the second half is where all of our EPS growth is coming from. Why is that? Well, we're purposely moving marketing spend from the second half to the first half because we have one of the biggest new product introductions in major categories in our history. And Barry is going to walk you through what each and one of those are. But we're excited about that. We're going to go ahead and spend the money upfront to drive trial, drive awareness to do that.\nAnd then the second point is we had a great first half in 2023. The first half of last year was a strong comp to compare against. We had 11% EPS growth last year in the first half. How do you think about -- or how do we think about EPS growth? Well, 8% to 10%, if we strip out the MEGALAC, again, we're not excluding MEGALAC. It's included. These are the shutdown costs. These are the stranded costs. So adjusted EPS growth before MEGALAC is 8% to 10%. MEGALAC impact is a 1% drag. That's why we get to 7% to 9%. If you think about the tax rate, that's also a headwind of about 2% for operating performance. So we're really strong operating performance is what I would want to leave you with for 2024.\nLet's look at our track record. Ten years of growth. Last year, net sales growth grew 9.2%, one of our strongest years ever, and we're going to have 4% to 5% growth on top of that growth in 2024. Organically, long track record again of above 4%. So the median for 2024 is 4.5% or the average. And we're going to -- that's better than our 10-year average better than our new evergreen model. So to have 4.5% or so above the 5.3% is, again, growth on top of growth.\nAnd it matters where that's coming from. In years past, before all the COVID noise and all the pricing and the inflation, we're a volume-driven company. 100% of our organic growth was really from volume. Many companies right now are talking about the return to volume. We've already returned to volume. The last 2 quarters consecutively, we have volume growth. We expect that in 2024 as well. About 2/3 of our growth we expect to be volume-driven growth in 2024.\nOn gross margin, this is a slide to spend some time on. So we had a fantastic gross margin expansion, 220 basis points in 2023. That got us to 44.1%. Our eyes are on our high of 45.5% back before COVID, the 2019 number. If we hit the middle of our 50 to 75 basis point outlook, then that means we have 80 bps remaining to get back to that kind of pre-COVID number. Now we also have tailwinds from acquisitions that we didn't have back then. But our eyes are firmly on recovering back to 45.5%. And that's also why we have confidence and raised our gross margin outlook for the next few -- for the future.\nHere's the bridge. So this is always the detail that folks want to see. 2023 price/volume mix as expected, very strong tailwind from price. In 2024, not as much. We have some carryover price, but it's not the driver. Manufacturing costs for a headwind of 240 basis points last year. We expect that to be closer to down 130, down 140, about $85 million. It was about $125 million in 2023. Acquisition is a tailwind in 2023. We don't expect to have acquisitions in 2024 from carryover impact on gross margin. Productivity programs up [ 150 ]. That was one of our best years ever. It was our best year ever for our productivity program. And then in 2024, we also expect to have a really strong productivity program.\nGross margin change would then be 220 in 2023 and then 50 to 75 in 2024. I'll spend a minute on manufacturing costs. Inflation is still there. I would say it's moderating. So maybe a few months ago, I would have said inflation, I would say it's moderate inflation. And the nuance in 2024 is a small piece of that is commodity-related. And whether it's resin prices or natural gas or sugar, those costs are up. But the bigger part for Church & Dwight is some of the costs and investments we're making in capacity. So the new depreciation on the capital that we've put in.\nWe added a new distribution center. We're outsourcing international supply in some cases until we can bring it in-house. We have higher third-party manufacturing costs and higher labor costs. So that's the bigger makeup of the pie, largely capacity driven as we grow into it.\nMoving to marketing. So 11% with 4% to 5% net sales growth, this is an investment of $35-or-so million. So this is real incremental dollars year-over-year to help drive the top line and share. SG&A, we continue to believe we're going to leverage SG&A. And I walk through even in the future evergreen model, leverage of 25 basis points to 0. So those investments behind international and e-com are key. And all that leads to great consistent strong EPS growth over time, double digit in many cases, or high single digit, and we have a great outlook in 2024.\nTurning to cash flow. So cash flow is what we believe drives value. And our free cash flow conversion, which is free cash flow divided by net income, is industry-leading. So for 10 years, our average was 119%. In our recent history, because we're making huge capital investments on CapEx, that number is down but still right in line with the industry or maybe even a little bit better. But we expect that to continue to inflect positively.\nOur cash conversion cycle. This has been a track record at Church & Dwight. We've taken our cash conversion cycle from 52 days down into the 20s. We had a spike up this year largely because of acquisitions. But again, that's going to work its way back down over time. Strong balance sheet, one of the strongest positions we've ever been in. So we ended this year at 1.8x levered. We expect to end next year closer to 1.6x.\nAnd this chart is updated. So even from a few months ago, back in September when we presented at Barclays, our financial capacity is about 20% higher. And why is that? It's because we're generating even more EBITDA. It's because we're generating and paying down cash at such a rate we're paying down debt as well. And so those things are just, again, virtuous cycles when we look at doing acquisitions and deals to grow our business. So number one, far and away for capital allocation is M&A and we're laser-focused on M&A. Number two is CapEx for organic growth and our Good to Great program. Number three is new products. Number four, debt reduction, and number five, return cash to shareholders.\nWe're not a capital-intensive company. We spiked up in 2022, 3% on the way down in 2024, and we believe we'll be at 2% of sales back to normal in 2025. Then finally, we have -- we announced this morning in the press release, we have a 4% dividend increase right in line with our capital allocation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Barry to talk about the domestic division and new products.\n\nBarry A. Bruno\n\nEVP of International, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everybody. I think Rick likes when I go right after the dividend slide to remind me I've got an obligation to keep it going, so 123 years strong and some more good quarters ahead. So I'm Barry Bruno. I'm responsible for our U.S. business. I'm going to talk a little bit about our categories, the U.S. consumer and what I think is some really great innovation that we've got in our key categories going forward.\nI'm going to start with a slide I left you with last year, which was we've got great confidence in our future. If you look at the categories in which we compete, and I'll show you a look at the old power brand and the new power brand categories to break them out for you, we're not only leaders in those categories. We're driving growth in those categories. We thrive in difficult environments. You've seen our value percentage of our portfolio. I'll take you through how, on ARM & HAMMER in particular, we bring consumers in tough times, we keep them, we trade them up.\nAnd then acquisitions have a ton of room to run, HERO and THERABREATH have been absolutely home runs, and they're in the early innings of that story still, and I'll show you what that looks like. So this slide was getting a little complicated, right? This is our old 14 power brand prior look, 17 categories. As we got into new categories, the chart got longer and longer. You can see which in '23 we're growing, mid-single-digit growth, high single-digit growth, pretty strong. But when you look at the new look of our 7 power brands and these compete in 8 categories, just as a reminder, ARM & HAMMER competes in laundry and litter, of course, 7 brands, 8 categories, incredibly strong growth, right? 11% in '21, 18% in '22 and then 16.9% on top of that. And we're driving a lot of that growth and I'll show you that in just a little bit. But these are exciting healthy categories to be in.\nMatt talked about these a little bit, too. So our portfolio has changed a little over time. So we're 63% premium, 37% value, still incredibly valuable to us in tough economic times as we bring consumers in and low private label exposure of 12%. And then the third reason for confidence is about these new acquisitions, right? When we met with you over the last 2 years talking about THERABREATH and HERO, it's been about our ability to build distribution to bring these to more and more consumers, and you can see the success that we're having. THERABREATH up 57% in terms of distribution last year and lots of room to run to catch up with the big guys, and HERO is another great story as well, up 200% last year and tons of room to keep growing.\nAnd that's just in MULO, that's in measured channels. If you look at it from a numerator standpoint, mouthwash is in 63% of U.S. households today. THERABREATH is only in 7%. And you can see the growth we're making from 1% to 2% to 3% to 4% to 7%, great growth, but there's a ton of households where we're not in just yet. And so there's room to run there. And HERO is the same story. HERO almost didn't exist 5 years ago with a 0.2% household penetration, up to 6.4% today. You can see the rate of growth accelerating. So whether you measure MULO or you measure numerator households, tons of room to run on acquisitions.\nSo let's look at some category and consumer dynamics now. We're going to start with our largest brand, ARM & HAMMER and one of our largest categories, fabric care. And the look back is a pretty compelling story of growth from a 5% share to an all-time share high, 14.4% last year on top of an all-time share high in the prior year. And all of that growth has been driven, as we've talked with you, about being anchored in the value tier of the laundry detergent category. That's about 30% of the category.\nBut I'm happy to be talking today about ARM & HAMMER Deep Clean, our most powerful formula and our first entry into the mid-tier segment. To give you some idea, that's about 27% of the category. The mid-tier, we haven't played there today. And we're thrilled about this new formula that's going to be launching in Q1 in 2024. And just to break it out for you so you can see our architecture, we've got our core ARM & HAMMER products. Those are our better products, ARM & HAMMER plus OXICLEAN, sorry, ARM & HAMMER Good, ARM & HAMMER plus OXICLEAN Better. And now with Deep Clean, our best formula and the best anchor in our architecture.\nAnd we are telling consumers about this new formula starting very soon, and I'll play one of the spots. We call it dig deep to show you how we're bringing awareness to the category and the brand.\n[Presentation]\nSo that's just 1 way we're spending some of the incremental marketing that Rick talked about earlier. But fabric care is so important to us, we're not done with Deep Clean. We're also happy to be talking about ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets, laundry sheets, not dryer sheets. We're the first mainstream brand to bring this form, new form of unit dose to market. We launched it in Q4 of last year online. We quickly grew to the #2 detergent sheet on Amazon, and we're expanding it into bricks-and-mortar this year. It's a great new form of unit dose.\nAnd there's a lot of education that needs to take place when you've got a new form, so let us show you how we're using one of our army of influencers to educate consumers about this great new form of unit dose. Let's play the spot.\n[Presentation]\nOnce is enough. You can tell she's excited about it. We are too. I just dropped my son off at college a few weeks ago and laundry sheets were one of the first things that I made sure I packed for him. Far more convenient than unit dose for -- than liquid for sure. So staying with ARM & HAMMER, moving over to cat litter, now another important multibillion-dollar category for us. You can see that the category is healthy, right? It was up 11% last year. It's been a consistent grower for a long time. During COVID, there were increased pet adoptions, then there were multiple rounds of price increases, 11.7% growth. ARM & HAMMER contributing to that growth, up 11.8% last year.\nWhen you're growing faster than category, you're gaining share, of course. We were up to a 24.8 share, almost a 25 share of the category. And you can see we've been a consistent growth over time from 23.6 up to 24.8. And one way that we're keeping that growth going is through new products, ARM & HAMMER Hardball is what we're talking about today. We're changing the lightweight litter experience. We think it's lightweight perfected, ultracompact strong clumps, 60% lighter than our base product today, plant-based, and it was one of the strongest-performing litter new product launches at Walmart last year. So we're expanding it nationally this year.\nAnd why are we so excited about lightweight? Well, today, we've just got a 4 share in the lightweight subsegment versus our 25 share overall. So getting our fair share equals $100 million opportunity in retail sales. So we're squarely focused on growing and gaining share in this important subsegment of the category. And we'll share how we're doing that via a piece of advertising right now, which is cats watching humans on the Internet. So a little bit of a different play. Let's play the spot.\n[Presentation]\nI swear we test all of our advertising and our cat-obsessed consumers love it, so it's helping to bring awareness to this great new product.\nAll right, switching gears to something slightly different, dry shampoo. BATISTE dry shampoo has been an absolute tear. The category is healthy, up 15.6% last year. As the leader in the category, we were up 16%. A combination of new products and advertising has absolutely driven continued growth for us. And you can see the share story is the same here, whether we're talking about litter or fabric care or BATISTE, we're hitting all-time share highs. We hit a 46.3% last year. We're up 9 share points in the last few years, so incredibly strong growth continues here.\nAnd again, the theme is the same. We're keeping it going with new products that we're supporting by advertising. Now we're talking about BATISTE Sweat and Touch Activated, our newest innovation in dry shampoo. They use bursting bead technology that have been in skin care before but never in dry shampoo, so they do -- they offer a burst of fragrance with every touch or drop of sweat for up to 24 hours of freshness. Those are launching starting now in Q1, both forms. And we think they're pretty futuristic. So we've engaged some help from the future to tell the story about this new product. Let's play the spot.\n[Presentation]\nSo I have a lot of fun with BATISTE as we approach a 50 share in the category and keep innovating and investing. VITAFUSION. It's a slightly different story when we talk about VITAFUSION vitamins. So once made VITAFUSION unique, our gummy form, our great taste, our wide assortment has now become really prevalent in the VMS category. There are over 60 vitamin players in the gummy form right now, and that's just in bricks and mortar. There are over 100 if you were to look at online players.\nSo ultimately, there's been a share decline but you've seen it's gone from 23.9% down to 12% in the category. The gummy category has just about doubled during that time, and you see a real inflection back in Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 during COVID. But obviously, the share decline is going to stop. And we're making the investments required to do just that because our consumers and our customers depend on us to do that. We're the #1 gummy player still Amazon, at Walmart, at Walgreens and all the players you see listed here. And we've got the highest household penetration in the gummy form.\nBut we've got to turn it around. And so we're investing in new product upgrades, to our base formulas, to new packaging that pop better at shelf. We're taking that new packaging into new displays to get off-shelf display. We've got new advertising to support it. And we're launching new forms beyond gummies in 2024 with the whole goal of stabilizing the business, stopping that share decline and getting back to growth in 2025.\nNow I'm going to close out talking about just a few acquisitions. So I'll start with THERABREATH, and I think this THERABREATH is pretty well known. 85% growth last year, right? Incredible growth, driving category growth of 12.8%. So healthy category, again, driven by THERABREATH where we're now category leaders. And you can see the share growth is absolutely playing out. This is in the total mouthwash category. We've gone from a 2 share to a 13 share in the alcohol-free portion of the category where we play, 26 share category leader.\nAnd actually a fun fact in January, alcohol-free for the first time is larger than the alcohol segment of the mouthwash category. So we are continuing to gain share and grow dramatically here. And it's a similar story where we've got a great new product, introducing THERABREATH Deep Clean, our first alcohol-free antiseptics 30% of the category today, we don't play there at all. Deep Clean is our first foray there. Kills 99% of germs with no burn because there's no alcohol and it's dentist-formulated launching in Q1. I don't have any great advertising to share with you here because the team just got back from L.A. last night, but we'll have it for those of you who are going to be at CAGNY as it supports our launch in Q1.\nAnd last but definitely not least is a little brand called HERO. And it's not so little anymore. You can see that it's absolutely driving category growth. We're up 72% last year, drive category growth of 20%. And when I say little, it was a 0.2 share 5 years ago. Right now it's an 18 share all-time category, high-end category leader in acne care. And we're absolutely keeping it going innovation in both our patch form. We're a leader with over a 50 share today. And in acne-adjacent skin care, where we're launching Dissolvaway, our daily cleansing bomb. So patch innovation, combined with skin care innovation equals lots of good growth yet to come.\nSo let's talk about patches for just 1 more second because the form is still not all that well known in the U.S. We've got the first national campaign called -- your mighty patch bringing awareness to this great new form, let's play that spot.\n[Presentation]\nAgain, the form is new so we're pioneering in the industry, launching the first new advertising nationally to bring awareness to this forum. So the summary is great momentum, right? You heard about all-time share highs in laundry and cat litter, on BATISTE, in mouthwash and in acne care. We've got great new products. We're supporting with more advertising. And ultimately, that brings us back to the algorithm that we were talking about earlier. You see we've raised our target to 3% for the U.S. And we're absolutely confident we can achieve that.\n7 out of the last 10 years, our U.S. business has been growing faster than 3%. And we're absolutely committed to continuing to do that going forward. One way we're doing that is via digital and e-commerce. And so Surabhi Pokhriyal is going to come up now to talk about how we're going to keep that great growth going. Thanks.\n\nSurabhi Pokhriyal\n\nChief Digital Growth Officer\n\nSurabhi Pokhriyal, I'm the Chief Digital Growth Officer here at Church & Dwight. So quick context setting because I know all of us are consumer goods users but not always fancy. Some geeky things might happen here so keep me honest as I present to you. I want to say that we are not in the business of getting consumers to shop online. We are simply in the business of being where the consumer shops, and that happens to be online more often than not.\nWith that said, 70% of purchases in the U.S. specifically are digitally influenced. What that means is every time you pick up that 6-inch device out of your pocket, look up your iPad, you are making purchase decisions not just to buy online but walk to the store, look up a review online and make that purchase. That's what digitally influenced means. Also, we are in the era of channel-less commerce. So the consumer is very fluid between buying in brick-and-mortar store, buying online or making that 2 a.m. order to get the product delivered to the door, maybe sheet.\nSo it's important to segregate how the physical shelf is very different from the digital shelf. The physical shelf is set once a year, maybe twice a year and it is set it, forget it. The digital shelf like this time-lapse video shows you changes by the second. So our tactics really have to cater to the online world in a very different manner.\nLet's talk some numbers, and Matt broke the thunder for me. We go from 220 in under 7 years, right? That's the kind of e-commerce penetration we are seeing for our categories. It's important to say here that we have seen a sustained post-COVID momentum in almost all of our categories where the consumer wants who has decided and chosen convenience doesn't want to give it back. Think about getting your letter subscribed and showing that up every month on your door versus having to lug it from the store.\nOf course, we are incessant about all-time share highs like Barry was speaking. In the online world also, we have new metrics where we say we aspire to be, in online share, at least equal or higher versus brick-and-mortar. And we have had some fantastic success, as you see here, 6 out of our new 7 power brands have grown in the share in 2023. And these are some all-time high share. Names, ARM & HAMMER, both laundry and litter, THERABREATH, NAIR and SPINBRUSH. It's important to understand. Now these were the results, like the what. Now I will speak a little bit to the how.\nAs Rick was mentioning, a lot of our media spend in the last couple of years has pivoted to digital, right, simply as the consumer has gotten on to more digital consumption, which is 80% today. But more than that is as we have more tactics to measure the efficacy of our media, we are having more and more ROI on every dollar that we put so we get maximum stretch out of our dollar so that we don't just meet the consumer at that moment of truth to get better returns on that dollar spent.\nSo broadly, right, I'm going to speak about the consumer connection in that zero moment of truth, whether the consumer meets us in an out-of-home advertising, on a YouTube video, or an Instagram influencer. But we add to it the incessant and the hallmark of Church & Dwight that is beautiful executional excellence. So I'll share with you some examples of how we execute.\nThese are some digital plus out-of-home advertising. What you will note here is each of them you might have seen in your own feeds. Sorry, back. Each of these you might have seen in your own feeds. What we try to do is we want to make content that is authentic to the platform. So when you see a YouTube advertisement or a Pinterest or a TikTok advertisement, it doesn't feel like an ad creative. It feels like a creative that was meant for that platform, and that's why it generates more thumb-stopping connection with the consumer.\nInterestingly, I'm sure AI is a buzzword all over the place. One thing that we are noting is there are some use cases of AI, especially in MarTech, where the creative that you see on the left from our brand NAIR usually, we might have story-boarded and created that over 5, 6 days. With the help of technology and with the right human oversight, these kind of creatives can now be created in under 5 hours or so. And we try to scale those creatives in what you see on the right, in a very large surround sound mode. So like I was mentioning, we have fit-for-platform, TV creative, social creative, retail media creative as the consumer buys online and search, all of that comes in a surround sound cohesive manner so that your martech-enabled creative goes far this right to the point of purchase.\nSocial. Social is what I call as the consumers engage in doomscroll, the endless scrolling. These are some creatives, which are truly, I believe, authentic, thumb-stopping, they are snacky content. We are no longer in the era where we would make a 60-second TV commercial, cut it down to 6 seconds. We want to and we do make commercials that are fit from platform 6 seconds. And like we say, on TikTok, we don't make ads, we make TikToks so that's the kind of creative we have. All of this creative is amazing. But as we get the consumer from inspiration to purchase, we have to make sure we have 1 click-to-cut because we know every time the consumer has to click more times, we lose 90% of that traffic. So from inspiration to purchase, it has to be a single click, and that's what drives a lot of our online revenue.\nAnother interesting pivot we have seen, especially in the last 2 years, usually, we would do go-to-market and go brick-and-mortar first and go large. We have slightly changed that model, especially for some launches like ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets and Hardball, where we would launch online first, get initial category and consumer insight, all that rich data, all the ratings and reviews Barry was mentioning, do audience testing on the different social platforms. A, we test the product detail page, the content that you see. And once we are satisfied by making it good online, we make it big in brick-and-mortar. That's exactly what we did with Hardball. That's what we are doing with ARM & HAMMER Sheets.\nWe noticed that on sheets, the consumer is looking for not just a sustainability message of good for you and good for the planet. They are looking for the clean that they trust in ARM & HAMMER. And that's what we learned online, and then we take it to brick-and-mortar in a large way. So in summary, in terms of metrics and aspirations, like I said, we are not in the business of getting consumers to shop online, but we are where the consumer is and online is a lot of growth for us, so we will be very passionate about growing online sales and share growth.\nTo clarify on share, we don't just look at pure-play, that is Amazon and Chewy. Online share is measured across Amazon, Chewy, walmart.com, target.com, kroger.com because that's the universe of where e-commerce happens in the country and globally. We are also more tech powered and human-guided related to the and ad tech investments that we are making. And the next step, the 2.0 and online for us is we are going to be more focused on efficiency and profitability ongoing to make fit-for-channel kind of products that make sense for us in the online world.\nSo I just want to say, in ending, we have come a long way from digital being a capability builder for Church & Dwight to digital now being a true business and growth driver for the company. So with -- on the topic of growth driver, I'll give it to Mike Read because international is also a huge growth driver for us. Thank you.\n\nMichael G. Read\n\nEVP of International, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. My name is Mike Read, I lead our international and our SPD business. So let me just start with the international story. As Rick mentioned earlier, we have upgraded our evergreen model so what used to be 6% organic growth, we now moved to 8% organic each year. So an exciting step for the division. If I break that down a bit, we're about $1 billion in size. There's kind of 2 parts to it. We have 6 subsidiary markets that go direct to retail. It's about 63% of our total business, Canada, U.K., Mexico, Australia, France, and Germany. The remaining 37% is through our Global Markets Group. So we operate in about 100 different countries. We partner with 400 value distributor partners around the world.\nSo our Global Markets business has been our fastest growing over the last few years and will continue to do so. And just to make that kind of point, if you go back to 2009, the international division has tripled in size. And during that time, the Global Markets Group has doubled in importance. So we see that trend continuing well. While we've had strong growth in our subs, we do expect GMG to continue to outpace that.\nIf I just give a summary of 2023, a very strong year. We had a breakout quarter in Q1, almost 12% growth, followed by 6.1% in Q2, 7.3% in Q3, and we finished strongly with 9.0% in Q4. So a full year organic of 8.5%. We had strong growth across all our subsidiary markets and double-digit growth across our GMG region as well. So across the board, really strong results. And that just shows the 6% to 8% evergreen model change.\nIf you look back over a number of years, other than the sort of setback from last year, we've had pretty consistent growth across a number of years and pitching above 8% in 2023 at 8.5%. I think the good news is relative to our peers, we're still very much underdeveloped. So we have about 17% of our sales as a company comes from international. We are very much in growth mode. Many of our peers are in the 59% to 60% range, so a long runway ahead. But what's most encouraging about that runway is we've got a portfolio that travels extremely well as do our acquisitions.\nSo we've got a combination of U.S. power brands like ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, VITAFUSION that travel very well, and that's complemented with a strong personal care and OTC portfolio headlined by BATISTE, STERIMAR and FEMFRESH. So brands that aren't necessarily commercialized in the U.S. that are playing important roles for the international division.\nI think most notably though is acquisition has been a really big part of the growth story within international. If you go back to a few years back with the acquisition of WATERPIK, that's one of our biggest brands internationally. And we're thrilled with the addition of THERABREATH and HERO. So just rolling both those brands out globally, both are on track and actually making a big splash already with lots to come. So we're really excited about adding those 2 pieces to the portfolio.\nIf I just sort of summarize sort of 3 key things to think about from an international perspective, Rick talked about some of the investments that we're making, particularly in our GMG group, but we are putting a lot of infrastructure process, IT to just shore up and be able to support the growth that's coming from our Global Markets Group. We've also added a lot of capabilities around portfolio strategy, revenue growth management, and as Surabhi mentioned, just really upskilling our digital e-commerce capability. And certainly, the acquisition additions and just getting on the front foot on both those acquisitions are the focus areas for international.\nAll right. So over to Specialty Products. So the Specialty Products division, we are holding our evergreen model at 5% growth. If you just break that into kind of 2 main parts, we have an Animal Nutrition business, which is about 2/3 of the business. You see sort of the impact of MEGALAC. The rest is Specialty Chemicals is about a $320 million business. If you kind of unpack that a little bit, a tough year in 2023. We're down minus 8%. Most of that is MEGALAC-driven. So if you take MEGALAC out, we're actually in positive growth, and the Animal Nutrition business was in stronger growth than that.\nMost importantly is we're still very focused on building out our portfolio and supporting prebiotics, probiotics, nutritional supplements across a wide range of species, dairy, cattle, swine, poultry. So nothing really changes. MEGALAC's coming out but the rest of the portfolio is strong. We have high growth ambitions for it. And most notably, we're focused on international similar to the consumer in -- so if you go back to kind of 2015, we are less than 6%. We're now at 17%, which is in the parallel of our consumer business, last year, grew 25%. So really strong growth internationally as well. So with that, I'll pass back to Matt Farrell.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.",
    "content2": "People who are long-term shareholders have a pretty good handle on this. You understand the brands and the growth rates and the margins and all that kind of good stuff. But the long-term shareholders have, I think, a better understanding of the importance of the culture in the company. And the culture of Church & Dwight is described in our annual report, and it's -- you can read it. It says we're a blue-collar organization. That doesn't mean -- that's not a dress code thing. This is -- we're just gritty people.\nA lot of high aptitude people. There's a lot of people that join our company that come from big CPG and get kind of tired of the big company thing and want to go small and we consider us so small. As we say, we're blue collar, we're high aptitude and we're underdogs. There's a lot of the people we compete with that are much bigger than we are. But beyond that, for the last 5 years, we've been getting into predictive analytics. So we go -- you're sitting in meetings at Church & Dwight, everybody wants to know, what are the facts, get the facts.\nThe next thing is Surabhi described is becoming digitally savvy. We've embraced that and it's throughout the company. And one of the things we said in our release and today is that, hey, we're going to be putting more money into this, that we're going to spend more money in e-commerce, both for people but also technology. And just to kind of round out what our culture is like we do embrace diversity. That's a super important and teamwork is super important. And finally, we're risk takers because as companies get bigger, they often want to pull back and you make decisions in groups and consensus, and that slows things down. And often, you don't make the best decisions.\nBut that's the element you're never going to read about in the sell-side analyst report. You might get it privately but you're not going to read it in a note. But that's one of the things that you're investing in, and that's one of the things that makes the company go. And if you think about 2022, we pancaked in 2022, right, minus EPS. Hadn't happened in 20 years. But the company is just so creative, clever, resilient that we said, hey, that's -- we're going to turn that around in 2023 and we have.\nThere are a few more things about how we run the place. First, I'll just -- I won't read them all to you but I'll kind of bomb through. Leverage brands. We've talked about the brands already. Now a friend of the environment, that's important to us as people and just as human beings but it's also important to the consumers. So if you talk to younger consumers, they're really interested in brands that want to be sustainable. So we've embraced that. And if you look at the laundry sheets, that is the most sustainable form of unit dose. It was in a cardboard box, there's no plastic.\nAnd it's just a little bit corny, but if you go back to the 19th century, hovering on the left part of this slide, we were putting pictures of birds in baking soda boxes, not baseball players but birds. And the card said, save the birds, save the planet. So this company wasn into environment before anybody could spell sustainability. Then more recently in 2021, we've made a commitment to science-based targets. And in 2023, we started investing in those. So we're putting our money where our mouth is in capital programs. And those capital programs, they're focused on removing, putting less CO2 into the atmosphere.\nBecause up until recently, what we've been investing in is trees to take the CO2 out of the atmosphere, but now we're going to reduce the amount that we actually pump out of our plants. And we get recognized for that. This is lots of rating agencies around the league that rate companies. But you can see we've been recognized BBB and now we're AA for the last couple of years.\nNumber 3 is the people. So I gave you a little bit of thumbnail with respect to the culture of the company. But we're like super productive, and I think this is a really underappreciated metric. So we generate over $1 million per employee in the company. And generally, you're going to see that with start-ups. And we were very proud of this. And like I said, we're -- if you talk to anybody that's coming up on this stage today, they'll all say we don't have enough people. And we do that deliberately because when you have fewer people, fewer really good people, you prioritize to only work on the stuff that matters. And again, that's part of the culture.\nWe have a really simple compensation structure, familiar net revenue, gross margin, and EPS, cash flow, but also strategic initiatives. We want to make sure that on an annual basis, we're also looking to the future and the types of strategic initiatives we have are with respect to the environment, DE&I, how well we're integrating acquisitions. Also, are we investing in international and also our e-commerce area, so there's 5 components to the strategic initiatives.\nAnd gross margin expansion, you saw we changed our evergreen model. Now we're saying we're going to expand faster in the future. And that rains money. And then you can spend that money back on marketing and back on SG&A and again, international and e-commerce. And when that's part of your incentive comp, if you're an employee, you're asking yourself, \"Okay, how can I get it? How can I participate?\" And here are some of the ways that we run after it. One is Good to Great, which is the name of our continuous improvement program. I always like to joke that, that's the book that everybody has heard about but nobody's read.\nThe next 1 is supply chain optimization. And this is just investing in our plants, automation, et cetera, new products, you want to launch new products that have a higher gross margin than the gross margin of the products that they're replacing. And then finally, acquisition synergies. When we buy businesses, that's one of the levers we have to improve the businesses that we buy, so our procurement supply chain, et cetera. But also, it's helping our gross margin going forward because of the mix.\nAll right. Number 4 is leverage assets. This is something else we pay a lot of very close attention to. So it is kind of a pretty slide, and we say 2% of our -- 2% of sales is generally what we think is our sweet spot for investing in CapEx, but we play close attention to the relationship of our cash earnings to our property, plant, equipment and working capital because we believe that every company is a machine. In the machine, you need to invest in assets, both property [indiscernible] net working capital and the relationship with the cash earnings, so that matters.\nOkay, and finally, if you do those first 4 really well, you're going to have a good company, you're going to get good returns. But if you put on top of that good acquisitions, and that is the skill of this company, if you look at all these acquisitions we've done over so many years, almost 1 per year, we [indiscernible] in 2023. We did look at 4 deals this past year but we're very fussy about what we're going to buy. So we've gone from $1.5 million to $5.9 million and a lot of that was through acquisitions. And I went through these before. We're very fussy. We stick to these. And with 7 big ones today with the opportunity to be even bigger, but more to come in the future.\nAnd just to kind of wrap up here, strong organic growth in '23, strong organic growth in '24. We're seeing 4% to 5% gross margin expansion again back to back. This new product pipeline is the best in my 17 years with the company. And then international is the future for us. You saw we're only 17% of our sales. Most of our competitors are 40% or higher. That's the future. And then e-commerce of 20% of our sales are ordered online today. We believe by the end of the decade, it will be 30%. So we got to get ready for that.\nAnd then finally, we generate lots and lots of cash so we're always on the hunt for new brands. And we're going to bring the whole crowd up here now so we can play the band. All right."

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in details in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of Q3 results. And I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. When Rick is wrapped up, we'll open the call up for questions.\nSo let's begin. Q3 is the fourth consecutive quarter of solid results beginning with Q4 2022. Reported revenue was up 10.5%, which exceeded our 8% outlook. Organic revenue grew 4.8%, also exceeding our 4% outlook. It's worthy of note that our global consumer business posted 5.8% organic growth, which exceeded our expectations. Going the other way, our SPD business accounted for 1 point of negative growth.\nGross margin expanded 270 basis points and marketing as a percentage of sales increased 80 basis points to 11.5% of sales. Adjusted EPS was $0.74, which is $0.08 higher than our $0.66 EPS outlook, and that result was driven by higher-than-expected sales growth and the gross margin expansion. It's important to call out the 2.7% positive volume growth in Q3. It's the first in 8 quarters, and our expectation is that positive volume growth will continue in Q4 to finish out the year.\nBut we continue to grow in the online class of trade. 17% of our global sales were purchased online in Q3 compared to 16% in the year-ago quarter. Just a few comments on the economy. Unemployment remains low in the U.S. and in most of our major international markets. Unemployment is a stat that we closely watch.\nRegarding the health of the consumer household, balance sheets are more stretched as savings are lower and credit card debt is higher. Student loan repayments are restarting. Mortgages and auto loans are more costly. Why? Because of higher interest rates and higher oil may lead to higher gasoline prices. So a higher cost environment leads to trade down as consumers look for the best value, especially in our household categories. And we are well positioned for this trade down given that 40% of our portfolio is value products.\nNow I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business posted strong 5.5% organic sales growth of which 3.6% was volume-driven. 7 of our 14 power brands held or gained market share in the quarter. And for context, the brands that grew share represent 65% of our U.S. sales.\nPrivate label is another stat that we closely watch. The good news here is the weighted average private label market share in our categories is stable. Now I want to look at a few of the more important categories in the U.S., starting with laundry. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry continues to see consumption growth driven in part by the continued trade down to value brands and by media support behind our new Give it the Hammer advertising campaign which celebrates the great value that ARM & HAMMER offers in tough economic times.\nARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent held share in the quarter as the category grew 5%. We're now at 14.3% share and extra. Our extreme value offering grew consumption 6.1% and increased market share to 3.8%. Regarding new products, we launched a new unit dose form of detergent, ARM & HAMMER power sheets laundry detergent as the first laundry detergent sheet from a major brand in the U.S. Power sheets is a convenient new unit dose form of detergent that delivers an entirely new laundry experience. It is mess-free, it's lightweight and eliminates plastic bottle waste while delivering the trusted ARM & HAMMER a powerful planning performance that consumers have come to rely on and love.\nWe launched the product online in August. In September, Power Sheet was the #1 laundry detergent item during Amazon's September Prime Day event. So we're off to a great start with this innovation, which will roll out even more broadly in 2024.\nNow litter, ARM & HAMMER litter also continues to perform extremely well with 11% growth outpacing the category, which was up 8% and growing share to almost 25%. Now consumers continue to choose ARM & HAMMER litter offerings. We have steady demand for our premium litter offering, which is a black box. But our orange box, in particular, is driving the growth as it offers a great value for the cost-constrained cat owner. Our new ARM & HAMMER hardball lightweight clumping litter is off to a solid start as distribution expands in the lightweight segment where we are underrepresented today.\nTurning now to personal care. BATISTE grew consumption 14% in the quarter, as we continue to build dry shampoo awareness and drive household penetration. The dry shampoo category and BATISTE have room to run as we continue to invest to build awareness and drive trial especially through sampling.\nHERO, which was acquired last October, captured the #1 market share position in the total acne treatment category. In the acne patch subcategory, Mintipatch is over 50% share. Retail distribution continues to grow, and we still have room to run as we expand across all classes of trade. The Hero team is doing a spectacular job growing this business. There continues to be a great deal of buzz here at Church & Dwight around the Hero brand and its future growth potential.\nSimilarly, THERABREATH, which was acquired in 2021, is performing extremely well and has been gaining share at a rapid pace. In Q3, THERABREATH breath took over the #1 share position in the non-alcohol segment with almost a 29% share. Distribution of THERABREATH has more than doubled since the acquisition date and we expect this brand to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight.\nRegarding a couple of businesses that depressed our results last year, WATERPIK continues to stabilize with Q3 coming in close to plan similar to Q2. And WATERPIK all channel consumption actually was up slightly in Q3. Turning to gummy vitamins. While Vitafusion was close to our expectations in the first half. Our consumption was down 11% in Q3 and partly due to distribution losses at many retailers due to our supply issues in 2022. And our job now is to win back retailer confidence and then regain lapsed consumers.\nNext up is international. Our international team is doing a great job delivering organic sales growth of 7.3% in Q3, driven by broad-based growth in most of our subsidiaries and our Global Markets Group, Volume contributed 2.3% of the growth, and this was led by Sterimar nasal hygiene and OxiClean. Both Sterimar and Hero are gaining distribution across our international markets, and we expect more to follow.\nAnd finally, Specialty Products. Organic sales decreased 10%, but this is largely due to 1 product line called MEGALAC, which is being hurt by inexpensive imports. Excluding MEGALAC, the remainder of SPD delivered positive growth of 2%. I'm going to wrap up by saying we just closed out a strong October and we expect positive volume growth for a second consecutive quarter in Q4. We raised our reported sales outlook to reflect the strength of consumer demand for our products, while maintaining our full year EPS outlook.\nNow when we are performing well going into the fourth quarter, it's an opportunity to invest in the business. This is a long-standing practice of reinvestment at Church & Dwight and is well understood by our long-term shareholders. We take a long view with respect to the health of the business.\nOur business model is working. Our value offerings are performing well as our premium offerings. Innovative new products are contributing to our growth and we have one of our best new product lineups coming in 2024. Acquisitions are on track and significant cash generation positions us to continue to add TSR-accretive brands to our portfolio. And now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some color on Q3 and the full year and the investments we'll be making in Q4.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter adjusted EPS was at $0.74, down 2.6% on the prior year. As Matt mentioned, the $0.74 was better than our $0.56 outlook, primarily due to higher-than-expected sales growth and gross margin expansion.\nNet sales were up 10.5% and organic sales were up 4.8%. Over half of our organic growth in the quarter was driven by volume. The total consumer business was up 5.8% organically. Our third quarter gross margin was 44.4%, a 270 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to improved pricing, volume, productivity and the impact of the Hero acquisition, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs.\nLet me walk you through the Q3 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive 140 basis points impact from price/volume mix, positive 120 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 160 basis point impact from productivity, partially offset by a drag of 150 basis points due to inflation.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was $27 million, up year-over-year Marketing expense as a percentage of sales was 11.5% or 80 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A increased 310 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher incentive comp from improved business performance, SG&A related to the Hero acquisition and investment spending.\nOther expense all-in was $21.8 million, a $2.4 million increase due to higher average interest rates. For the full year, we now expect other expense of approximately $95 million. For income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.1% compared to 20.2% in 2022. And an increase of 390 basis points as the prior year rate included the benefit of a nonrecurring state tax reduction. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 22%.\nAnd now to cash. For the first 9 months of 2023, cash from operating activities was $795 million, an increase of $261 million due to higher cash earnings, including the positive impact from recent acquisitions and improvements in working capital.\nTurning to the full year outlook. We now expect the full year 2023 reported sales growth to be approximately 9%, up from our previous outlook of 8%. We continue to expect organic sales growth to be approximately 5%. We now expect full year reported gross margin to expand 210 basis points, up from 200 basis points.\nThis is an encouraging trend as we continue to move closer to restoring gross margins to pre-COVID levels. We continue to expect a double-digit percentage increase in gross profit in full year 2023.\nLooking at inflation, we continue to expect around $120 million of higher manufacturing costs in 2023. This is well below what we have experienced the last couple of years. While many commodity prices remain below prior year levels, resins and oil-based commodities are a bit higher. We continue to expect full year marketing as a percent of sales to be 11% and we continue to expect full year SG&A to be higher in both dollars and as a percent of sales compared to 2022.\nSG&A is expected to be higher than our previous outlook driven by incremental R&D investments, higher incentive compensation given our strong performance a bad debt reserve related to 1 specific customer situation. As in past years, when we have strong business performance, we invest for the future, our investments will focus on driving future growth with higher marketing dollar investment R&D investment, including clinical studies and accelerating product registrations in international markets as well as driving efficiency, including investments in automation and technology.\nWe continue to expect full year adjusted EPS growth to be approximately 6%. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the step up of marketing that we've been talking about and higher SG&A. We continue to expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1 billion.\nOur full year CapEx plan is now expected to be approximately $230 million as we continue to make capacity investments, and we expect to return to historical levels of CapEx and about 2% of sales by 2025.\nMoving on to Q4. We have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of 5% and approximately 4% for organic, with volume contributing 1% or better. Organic growth rate in Q4 reflects positives from HERO, litter and there breadth and negatives from not repeating some low-margin laundry promotions.\nWe expect gross margin expansion significant increase year-over-year in both marketing and SG&A and marketing is expected to be in excess of 14% in Q4. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.63 per share, a 2% increase from last year.\nSo to summarize, a strong 9 months of the year behind us, we saw the inflection point of volume growth as expected, and we are spending on marketing and investments to build momentum for 2024 and beyond. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take questions.",

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of Q2 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick has wrapped up, we'll open the call up for questions. Q2 was an excellent quarter for Church & Dwight. Reported revenue was up 9.7%, exceeding our 7% outlook. And this is thanks to strong results from several brands, including our 2 most recent acquisitions, HERO and THERABREATH. Organic sales grew 5.4%. This exceeded our 3% Q2 outlook. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points and marketing as a percentage of sales increased 130 basis points. Two items that are worthy of note. First one is 18% of our global sales were purchased online compared to 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. And second, private label is stable in our categories, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.92, and this was $0.14 higher than our $0.78 EPS outlook. And that result was driven by higher sales, higher-than-expected gross margin and a lower tax rate. Now I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business had 6.3% organic sales growth and 6 of our 14 power brands held or gained market share in the quarter. And for context, the brands that grew share represent 65% of our U.S. sales.\nNow I want to look at a few of the more important categories in the U.S., starting with laundry. So laundry is a real success story in Q2. Church & Dwight closed out the quarter as the fastest-growing overall laundry detergent, liquid detergent, unit dose detergent and scent booster manufacturer in both dollar and unit share. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry continues to see strong consumption growth, driven in part by the continued trade down to value brands and in part by media support behind our new, Give it the Hammer master brand advertising campaign. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent grew share by 90 basis points in the quarter, so we're now at 14.5% share. And Extra, which is in the extreme value segment of the category, grew consumption 7.2% and gained 20 basis points of share in Q2.\nARM & HAMMER litter also continues to perform extremely well with 12.6% growth outpacing the category and growing share. Consumers continue to choose ARM & HAMMER litter offerings and our orange box, in particular, offers great value for the cost constrained cat owner.\nTurning now to Personal Care. BATISTE grew consumption 12% in the quarter as we continue to build dry shampoo awareness and drive household penetration. While Trojan delivered share growth and increased share to 68.3% in Q2. HERO, which was acquired last October, grew year-over-year consumption by 66%, gating 4.7 share points to achieve a 17.2% market share in the total acne treatment category. The number of retail distribution points has tripled since we acquired the brand, and we still have room to run as we expand across all classes of trade. The HERO team is doing a spectacular job growing this business, and there continues to be a great deal of excitement at Church & Dwight about the HERO brand. Similarly, THERABREATH, which was acquired in 2021 and is performing extremely well with 100% year-over-year consumption growth in the quarter. THERABREATH grew share of 5.6 points year-over-year to a 13% share of the mouthwash category, the mouthwash category grew 14% in the quarter, and THERABREATH accounted for 50% of the category growth. Distribution of THERABREATH has more than doubled since the acquisition date. So THERABREATH is now the #2 non-alcohol mouthwash brand and the clear #3 in total mouthwash. And we expect this brand to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight. Regarding a couple of businesses that depressed our '22 results, WATERPIK is stabilizing, with Q2 coming in close to plan, and this is similar to Q1. While Vitafusion was close to our plan in the first half, our consumption was down in Q2, 9%, partly due to distribution losses at some retailers due to our supply issues in 2022.\nThe good news is the gummy category was up 1% in Q2 after 3 successive down quarters. And our job now is to win back retailer confidence and then regain lapsed consumers. So we expect both businesses, this is WATERPIK and Vitafusion year-over-year to be flat net sales, so although not hurting us in '23 versus '22.\nNext up is international. Our international team is doing a great job, delivering organic sales growth of 6.1% in Q2, driven by broad-based growth in every 1 of our 6 subsidiaries in all 5 regions of our Global Markets Group. And finally, Specialty Products. Specialty Products organic sales decreased 6.5%, but this is primarily due to lower volume in the dairy business as lower-priced imports returned to the U.S. market. I'm going to wrap up my comments right now by saying consumption on our consumer products businesses are strong. A return to volume growth is expected in the second half. In fact, July is off to a very strong start. Our value offerings are performing well, as are our premium offerings, acquisitions are on track. And because we had an excellent first half, and we have a strong outlook for the second half, we are in a position to significantly increase our marketing spend. Last year, we pulled back on marketing due to our fill rate issues. When we started 2023, we intended to increase our marketing from 10% of sales in 2022 to 10.5% of sales in 2023 and then 11% in 2024. So we now intend to ramp up marketing to 11% of sales this year in 2023 and in support of our brands and new product launches as business gets back to normal. And now I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some color on Q2 and the full year and other investments that we'll be making in the second half.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody.\nWe'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.92, up 21% to the prior year. As Matt mentioned, the $0.92 was better than our $0.78 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products and higher-than-expected gross margins as well as a lower tax rate. Net sales was up 9.7% and organic sales were up 5.4%. Almost half of the reported revenue growth year-over-year was HERO. Organic sales were once again driven by pricing in Q2 with volumes slightly down. That slight decline was better than expected and turning to the second half, we continue to expect a return to volume growth. Our second quarter gross margin was 43.9%, a 270 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to productivity pricing and strong contributions from higher-margin acquisitions that are offsetting inflation. This result exceeded our expectations for the quarter as we saw a greater impact from productivity programs, a better product mix driven by our recent acquisitions.\nLet me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive 280 basis points impact from price/volume mix, positive 120 basis points from acquisitions, a positive 160 basis point impact from productivity and 10 basis points from currency, partially offset by a drag of 300 basis points due to higher manufacturing costs. For the balance of the year, we expect this trend to continue.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was $29 million, up year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 9.1% or 130 basis points higher than Q2 of last year. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all in was $24 million, a $9.1 million increase due to higher average interest rates. For the full year, we now expect other expense of approximately $100 million. We do not have any looming long-term debt refinancing. In fact, other than the $200 million left in our term loan, August of 2027 is the timing of our next maturity.\nFor income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 17.9% compared to 24.1% in 2022, a decrease of 620 basis points driven by a higher tax benefit from stock option exercises, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 22%. And now of cash for the first 6 months of 2023, cash from operating activities increased to $509 million due to higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital.\nTurning to the full year outlook. Given the strength of our Q2 results and our confidence for the remainder of the year, we're raising our outlook for sales, gross margin, EPS and cash flow. We now expect the full year 2023 reported sales growth to be approximately 8%. And organic sales growth to be approximately 5%. Given the strength of the business, we see opportunities to make incremental investments in our brands and capabilities in future quarters. We now expect full year reported gross margin to expand 200 basis points. Compared to our previous outlook, we see commodity cost favorability, higher productivity and faster growth from our higher margin recent acquisitions. While we have seen some pockets of lower inflationary pressure, since our prior outlook, we continue to expect net inflation for the year. For perspective, we expect $120 million of manufacturing cost increases in 2023, much better than the $290 million we saw in 2021 and the $250 million in 2022, but still elevated from historical levels.\nSpeaking of history, if we look back at history from 2010 to 2019, we typically had 2% of COGS as inflation. During the COVID impacted years of 2020 to 2022, we saw an 8% of COGS impact. And in 2023, we're seeing about a 4% inflation rate. So currently, we see commodities like ethylene down 20% year-over-year. However, going the other way, we see soda ash, up 50%. Soda ash is now used with lithium for lithium carbonate, which is then used in lithium batteries and solar panels. This demand spike, combined with pressure on the supply side. So for example, China is the largest supplier of soda ash globally and has had intermittent supply issues, and that's causing upwards pressure on price.\nSo the point is we're not in a deflationary period as of yet. Wrapping up gross margins, we have made a lot of progress. However, for the full year, we still expect to be about 200 basis points below our pre-COVID margin levels. So a lot of opportunity over the next few years. We intend to increase marketing as a percent of net sales to 11%. This is great news as we previously anticipated getting back up to 11% in 2024 and the fact that we're able to get there sooner than initially anticipated will position the business well for the future.\nWe expect SG&A both in dollars and as a percent of sales to increase compared to 2022. The increase in SG&A is expected to be larger than what was assumed in our prior outlook as the strong business performance increases incentive compensation and as we make strategic investments. As in past years, when we have strong business performance we're investing for the future. These investments are focused in 2 areas: First, growth with higher marketing investments and R&D investments around MPD as well as accelerating product registrations in international markets. Second would be efficiency, investments in automation and technology. We now expect full year EPS to be approximately 6%. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance includes a step-up of marketing that we're talking about in higher SG&A. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $1 billion. Previously, we expected to be $950 million. The $50 million increase is driven by higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $250 million as we continue to make capacity investments, and we expect to return to historical levels of 2% of sales by 2025.\nStrong performance in the first half of the year drove 12% EPS growth as a result of accelerating investments, we expect second half EPS growth to be flat. And for Q3 specifically, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of 8%, approximately 4% for organic and gross margin expansion.\nWe also expect a significant increase year-over-year in marketing spend as well as SG&A. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.66 per share, a 13% decrease from last year's adjusted Q3 as investment spending is weighted more towards Q3. So to summarize, a strong 6 months of the year are behind us, a return to volume growth in the back part of the year and a lot of momentum as we move into 2024. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take questions.",

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is wrapped up, we'll open the call for questions.\nSo Q1 was a solid quarter. Reported revenue was 10.2%. Organic sales grew 5.7% and exceeded our 1% Q1 outlook. Of the 10.2% reported sales growth beat our outlook of 4%, thanks to stronger results from several brands, including Hero, THERABREATH, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER litter and exceptionally strong sales growth in our international business. The other good news is that the vitamin business and the WATERPIK business hit their Q1 sales plan, and were right on expectations.\nAnd finally, it's also fair to say that we had a degree of conservatism in our original Q1 outlook, both top line and bottom line. Our Q1 top line growth reflects the strength of our brands, both premium and value and also our focus on execution. The combination of consumer demand and improved case fill, which is now over 93% in the U.S. is resulting in strong revenue growth.\nSomething else that is noteworthy, we had flat volume growth in Q1, which is an encouraging sign after declining volumes in the last 6 quarters, and we now expect volume growth in our full year net sales outlook.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.85, which was $0.10 higher than our $0.75 EPS outlook. And that was driven by higher-than-expected sales in the U.S. and especially in our international business, which posted 11.6% organic growth. In Q1, global online sales as a percentage of total sales was over 16%, and we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 16%.\nNow private label shares remained consistent with historical weighted averages. Both domestic and internationally, private label is stable in our categories.\nAnd now I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. The U.S. consumer business had 5.5% organic sales growth, and 8 of our 14 power brands held or gained market share in the quarter. Now I want to look at a few of the important categories in the U.S., and I want to start with laundry.\nIf we look at the big picture, value laundry detergent grew 9%, while premium detergent declined 3%. So the trade down to value detergent continues into 2023. During Q1, the liquid laundry category grew 3.6%, while ARM & HAMMER grew 9.3%. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent grew share by 80 basis points in the quarter to 14.3%. So with more consumers migrating to ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, we have the potential for a long-term benefit to the ARM & HAMMER brand similar to the last recession.\nNow over in litter, the category grew 12.7%, while ARM & HAMMER litter grew 13.5%. So we gained market share in the quarter. We did see a trade down from our premium ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter to our ARM & HAMMER value litter, which is in the orange box. So consumers are staying in the ARM & HAMMER franchise. And our Give it the Hammer advertising campaign, which halos met the many categories that ARM & HAMMER competes in is resonating with consumers.\nNow in dry shampoo, the dry shampoo category was up 11.8% in Q1, driven by BATISTE consumption, which was up 20%. We now enjoy a 46.2% market share in dry shampoo.\nIn the condom category, the condom category was up 4.1% in Q1, while TROJAN consumption was up 5.3%. There again, we gained 80 basis points of market share, thanks to our new TROJAN BARESKIN RAW condom and the success of more targeted marketing.\nOur most recent acquisitions, THERABREATH mouthwash and Hero are performing extremely well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December of 2021, had just a great quarter with 70% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share 6.8 points to 22.5% of the alcohol-free mouthwash. And as promised when we bought the brand, distribution of THERABREATH has doubled since we acquired it in December of 2021. THERABREATH is now the #2 non-alcohol mouthwash brand and the clear #4 in total mouthwash. We expect this brand to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight.\nNow ZICAM, this is a December 2020 acquisition, also delivered strong results this quarter. ZICAM is the #1 brand in the cold shortening segment with a 78% share.\nNow to our latest acquisition, Hero, which grew year-over-year consumption by 43.5% and gained 1.6 share points to achieve a 9.1% market share in the total acne treatment category. And distribution has expanded by 50% since the October acquisition date. And as we said in the release, there continues to be a great deal of excitement around Hero -- about the Hero brand and especially the Hero team.\nFrom our oldest brand to our recent acquisitions, our brands are driving category growth. I'm going to give you a few examples. ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, which has a 14% share of the liquid laundry category drove 35% of the category growth. In the dry shampoo category, BATISTE has a category-leading 46% share, but contributed 75% of the category growth. And in the mouthwash category, THERABREATH makes up 11% of the total category but delivered over 50% of the growth in mouthwash.\nNext up is international. Our international business delivered organic growth of 11.6% in Q1, driven by strong growth in the subsidiaries and double-digit sales growth from our Global Markets Group, and that was quite balanced across all of our global regions. And the growth was headlined by BATISTE, vitamins, FEMFRESH, WATERPIK and Gravol. And as far as the consumer goes, similar to the United States, unemployment remains low in our international countries where we have subsidiaries. However, in many of these markets, particularly in Europe, the consumer is facing inflation in energy and food, but so far, consumption has remained strong.\nIn China, while it is a relatively small market for us, we are experiencing stronger growth in Q1 and remain optimistic about the full year apart.\nAnd finally, Specialty Products. Specialty Products organic sales decreased 5.9% primarily due to lower volume in the dairy business as low price imports returned to the U.S. market.\nI want to wrap up my remarks right now by saying consumption is strong. Our value offerings are performing well as are our premium offerings. Acquisitions are on track. We're ramping up our marketing this year in support of our brands and new product launches. And we expect to have the opportunity to invest even more behind our brands in future quarters.\nAnd now, I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you some more color on Q1.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.85, up 2.4% the prior year. The $0.85 was better than our $0.75 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products, and higher-than-expected gross margins. Reported revenue was up 10.2% and organic sales were up 5.7%. About half of the reported revenue growth year-over-year was Hero. Organic sales were once again driven by pricing in Q1. However, as Matt mentioned, the fact that volume was flat, was encouraging and gives us confidence that we will return to volume growth later this year.\nMatt covered the segments, so I'll go right into gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 43.5%, a 90 basis point increase from a year ago, primarily due to improved pricing, productivity and the impact of the Hero acquisition, net of the impact of higher manufacturing costs.\nLet me walk you through the Q1 bridge. Gross margin was made up of the following: positive 160 basis points impact from price/volume mix; positive 120 basis points from acquisitions; a positive 160 basis points from productivity; and 10 basis points from currency, partially offset by a drag of a 360 basis point impact due to higher manufacturing costs, including inventory charges related to discretionary brands primarily flawless. For the balance of the year, we still expect sequential improvement in gross margin year-over-year expansion throughout the year.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was up $20 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 8.6% or 70 basis points higher than Q1 of last year. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 90 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $23 million, an $8.6 million increase due to higher interest rates.\nOur expectations for interest rates for the remainder of the year remain unchanged from our prior guidance. We do not have any looming long-term debt refinancings. In fact, August of 2027 is the timing of our next maturity.\nFor income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.4% compared to 23.2% in 2022, an increase of 120 basis points. We continue to expect the full year rate to be approximately 23%.\nAnd now to cash. For the first 3 months of 2023, cash from operating activities increased to $273 million due to higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. We now expect full year cash flow from operations to be approximately $950 million. Previously, we expected $925 million. The $25 million increase is driven by higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital. Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $250 million as we continue to make capacity investments, and we expect to return to historical levels by 2025.\nAnd now for the full year outlook. Given the strength of our Q1 results and our confidence for the remainder of the year, we are raising our outlook for sales, EPS, gross margin and cash flow. We now expect the full year 2023 reported sales growth to be approximately 6% to 7% and organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%. We now expect full year EPS in the range of 2% to 4% growth.\nGiven the strength of the business, we see opportunities to make incremental investments in our brands and capabilities in future quarters. We now expect full year reported gross margin to expand approximately 120 basis points. And as we expect pricing and productivity to more than offset inflation.\nOur full year inflation expectations remain unchanged from our previous outlook. Gross margin is expected to benefit from pricing, pack size changes, longer concentration and the full year impact of the higher-margin Hero business. As you read in the release, 2 items of note that are aiding our margin recovery are new litter pricing that went into effect on February 1 and the latest round of concentration for laundry. We intend to increase marketing as a percent of net sales to 10.5%. We continue to expect SG&A both in dollars and as a percent of net sales to increase compared to 2022 as the company's incentive compensation plan returns to normal levels in 2023. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes a step-up in our level of marketing investment as well as higher SG&A.\nFor Q2, we have a strong outlook and expect reported sales growth of approximately 7%, organic sales growth of approximately 3% and gross margin expansion and higher marketing spending. The math would show a sequential decline in sales growth, but it's easy to explain. First, distribution pipeline fill for Hero and THERABREATH accounted for 1% of growth in Q1 that will not repeat in Q2. The other is around quarterly comps and how that impacts the current year.\nFor the domestic business, there was a large improvement in case fill in Q1 to Q2 last year, which leads to a tougher comp in Q2 of this year compared to Q1 last year. As an example, our international business in Q1 in 2022, organic growth was 0 and in Q2 it was 6.5% in 2022. As a result, adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.78 per share, a 2.6% increase from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take questions.",

All right, I'll call everybody to attention. Hey, we haven't been together for a few years. The last number were down here was January of 2020. So it's been 3 years. It's really great to see so many familiar faces in the room. We've got a great show for you today. I'm going to start off with the safe harbor statement. I encourage everybody to read that when you have some time. And here's who is here from management today, which have virtually the entire management team. So when we're done with the presentation, everybody will come on up, fill the stage, and then we can do Q&A.\nAll right. We've got a pretty packed agenda. Some of it will be familiar to you, but these are all the things we think we want you to walk out of the room knowing more than when you walked in the room. All right. So I want to start with a look back at 2022. So as you all know, we had significant inflation this past year. We had $250 million of increases in COGS year-over-year '22 versus '21. And how we reacted to that, we increased prices both in '21 and in '22. And in some cases, we raised prices more than once. You saw that in laundry and also on litter. We have really great success this year with several of our brands. As you can see on the page here, ARM & HAMMER litter laundry detergent and BATISTE at all-time highs, recked shares. And then if you look at some of our more recent acquisitions, and that would be ZICAM THERABREATH and [HERO] acquired in 2020, '21 and '22, all had double-digit growth and all-time high market shares. And then finally, we know we've experienced a black swan event over the past few years. We know there'll be others in the future. So we've done a lot of work in '21 and '22, spent a lot of money, a lot of effort getting ready for the next one. And then finally, we ended the year strong.\nSo what you see on the slide here that the categories that we're in grew consumption, 13 out of 17. And just as kind of a leave behind, these are the 17 categories that we compete in. So you can take a look at this after class is which categories went up and which categories did not. All right. Now here's a slide that we show every year, and this is a very different slide than we've seen in the 16 years that I've been with Church & Dwight. So the first 15 years with Church & Dwight -- every year, we've had significant TSR. And in many, many years, it's been double digit. And this year, we went backwards. And that's a disappointment to me, it's a disappointment to the management team, to the Board and our shareholders. And so granted, we have that disappointment. But now we're just going to brom ourselves off, take our sows up. We got a great company. We've got great brands, and we're looking ahead with optimism to and we plan on starting another 15-year streak starting in 2023.\nAll right. So why do we have so much confidence in our future. First off, we'll go left to right U.S. So Barry is going to come up in a little while and talk about our plans for the U.S. business and why we expect growth in the future. Mike Reid is going to come up and talk to us about international for a long time. International has been growing at 6% annually. That, by the way, is our model. And he's going to tell you why we believe that to continue in the future. innovation as well. Barry is going to talk about innovation. We're a very innovative company. It's been a big contributor to our top line growth for many, many years. And Barry is going to take you through one innovation, in particular, which is hard ball new leader that we're launching this year, we think could transform the litter category. [Serebbiis] going to come up. She's our Chief Digital Officer. He's going to talk about how digitally savvy we've become on our plans for the future. And finally, the Evergreen model. everybody in the room, particularly long-term holders. We're very familiar with our evergreen model, 3% top line, 8% bottom line growth. That model is healthy long term. We have strong fundamentals in 2023, we think we'll return to that model in 2024.\nAll right. So now who we are. So we're a $5.4 billion company. You can see how we split. We're largely a U.S. business, 77% domestic, International and our Specialty Products business, which is our legacy business is a business that the company was founded on, it's about 6% today. So we have 14 power brands. Those 14 power brands make up 85% of our revenues and profits. One brand you won't see up there today is flawless. That's a business that we bought 4 years ago. It obviously didn't turn out the way we had expected as disclosed in the release. But as I said, these 14 power brands drive 85% of our revenues and profits. So here's our formula. We have a balanced and diversified portfolio. I'll take you through some stats in a minute. We have low private label exposure. The weighted average exposure is 12%. And innovation, Barre, is going to take you through a little while, and we are an acquisitive company. We generate lots and lots of cash and the first destination for our cash is a TSR accretive acquisition. So here's some of the diversity stats I want to share with you. So we're 40% value, 60% premium. For as household and personal care split, it's about even 46% household, 48% personal care. And here's our weighted average private label exposure. And this is over a long period of time. It's generally around 12%. That really hasn't changed that much recently. There are the 5 categories that we're most exposed to. You can see on the chart there, see how the private level has moved up and down over time. But it's generally stable even in this environment. And as far as consistent innovation, this is the lineup a lot of the new products we're going to be launching in 2022. The upper left, you see hard ball. I think you're really going to be excited about that when you hear about it later today.\nAll right. We have a long history of growth through acquisitions. If you look at -- go back 2004, $1.5 billion. We've added almost $4 billion to our top line, and a lot of that is through acquisitions. You can see they're all laid out through the bottom. Almost every year, we add a new brand. And in the year 2000, the only brand we had was ARM & HAMMER. So with 13 of our 14 power brands have acquired -- been acquired since the beginning of the century. And most of those brands are #1 and #2 in their category. And we have very clear acquisition criteria. Got to be #1 or #2 in their categories. Notably, they need to be high-growth and high-margin brands that are fast-moving consumables. We've added fast-moving consumables because of our experience with FLAWLESS. Asset-light -- so we're a company that doesn't invest a whole lot in plants. We like to buy businesses that are already made by third parties, by co-packers. And we like to be able to leverage our considerable supply chain. And then finally, it needs to have a long-term competitive advantage. All right. So the short story is, we have 14 brands today. We hope to have 20 tomorrow.\nAll right. And I think that's it for me. I'm going to pass it over to Rick.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Head of Business Operations, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Matt. So we're going to go through quite a few things, Evergreen model, how we finished 2022. We're talking about 2023, and we'll also talk about capital allocation and cash flow. So first off, this is how we begin and end most presentations. This is our organic evergreen model. So we start off with 3% of sales growth. We have gross margin expansion. Of 25 basis points. We have marketing that's usually flat on a percent of sales but higher dollars. We leverage SG&A to get to 50 basis points, and then we expand EPS by about 8%. That is our long-term algorithm. So in Q4, what happened. So in Q4, we had a better-than-expected quarter. We were 300 basis points better on reported sales. Half of that was organic. Half of that was a little bit of FX and then the [HERO] acquisition did better than expected. So thumbs up on reported sales growth thumbs up on organic sales growth. Gross margin was a contraction. That's what we expected. And we've stair-stepped better throughout the entire year in 2022, and we expect that to continue in 2023. Adjusted EPS was $0.62 at the high end of our range, and then cash from operations, I'll talk about on the full year, but we significantly beat our cash flow projections as well. For the full year, we came in around 3.5% reported sales growth versus 3%, about 1.5% versus 1% on organic, and then gross margin was way down. And you heard Matt say, $250 million of year-over-year inflation was the driver behind that. Adjusted EPS was $2.97, high end of the range. And then reported EPS was down 49% or $1.68 and that was really the flawless noncash impairment. And then cash from operations was $885 million versus our outlook of $800 million, and that's really strong cash earnings and improved working capital, primarily inventories were coming down back in line especially for our discretionary businesses, which was good to see.\nOkay. Moving to 2023. So we try to simplify the outlook. We have the detailed outlook on the next page, but this is a chance just to take a step back and say, how are we doing. Our outlook is 0% to 4% the midpoint is 2% EPS growth. Before we get into the investments on marketing, SG&A and the impacts below the line, our core adjusted EPS growth is 10%, double digit. So we're really pleased with how strong the business is performing. We've chosen to make investments in brands and people. And so we're increasing our marketing spend up to 10.5% of sales, and that's about a $30 million investment or a 3% drag on EPS. Incentive comp normalization, and we didn't have a very good incentive comp year this year, back to par is about $30 million or so, and that's another 3% drag. And then interest and taxes is a 2% drag. Here is a detail of the financial outlook. So 5% to 7% reported sales growth, 2% to 4% reported -- 2% to 4% organic sales growth that is in a entities the HERO acquisition. The detail for organic is for the divisions is 2% to 3% for the domestic division, 3% to 5% for international and SPD at 5% to 6%. Gross margin for the first time in a long time expands by 100 to 120 basis points. That is exciting for us, right? We've had a stair step down over the last few years. This is a road to recovery, and we'll get into the details in a minute. Marketing that's the investment I talked about. SG&A is higher, and we'll talk through that. Operating margin is flat. And then other expense, we're calling out as a drag of $110 million. We're $35 million higher on interest expense next year because of hero debt, and we have some variable debt that has rates going up. Effective tax rate is 23%, and then the EPS growth is 0% to 4% and cash is strong, up 5% or so to $925 million.\nHere's a track record of reported sales growth. I don't think we've shown this slide before. We usually just show organic, but we thought we'd show both. So over the last 10 years, we've averaged 6% and of reported sales growth. And in 2023, we expect no different 5% to 7%. Organically, here's the 10-year track record. Our average is around [4]. Our organic model -- Evergreen model is [3], and our range in 2023 is [2 to 4]. Now one of the most important things about organic sales growth is how you get it. And I'd say if you look back at the last 8 to 10 years, most of our growth is volume growth. Historically, our Everbridge model was 3%, then we would have 3% volume growth and pretty much flat on pricing. 2022 is a little bit of an aberration, all the pricing that's happening all over the industry because of all the inflation that's happening all over the industry. But you can see in Q3 of 2022, we had really the low point for volume growth. And we have improvement in Q4. We have further improvement, although negative in Q1, further improvement, although negative in Q2, and then we inflect positively in the back half of 2023 is the expectation. Now moving to gross margin. So 100 and 120 basis points. Why do we believe that we can expand. Inflation is moderating. We still have inflation, it's just moderating. Productivity programs are doing well. margin-accretive acquisition, that's CRO, and we're improving our case fill in a big way. So you can see that 41.9% goes to around at the midpoint, 43% and if you look at the track record, 45% is kind of where we were. And so we have room to run over the next few years. And here's the detailed gross margin. This is the bridge in 2022, we were down 170 basis points, and there is a massive headwind because of inflation. In 2023, we think yes, we still have inflation down 240 basis points, but price volume mix, plus productivity offset inflation for the first time in a long time, and then we have help from our acquisition. So that's how we're up 110 basis points year-over-year.\nOn marketing, so a similar story. We have full year marketing support. We have better product supply. We're going to get to [10.5%]. If you do the simple math, and look at our high water mark back in 2020, it was around 12%. Now remember, we took price these last 3 years, and we don't raise marketing dollars just because we -- the price of the widget went up. So 12.1%, effectively, if you strip out the price increases is around 10.7%. So between 10.5% and 11% is equivalent to that 12%. So by stair stepping up to 10.5%, we really feel good about the support we have for the brands. is higher, and it's higher for a few reasons. HERO has stand-alone SG&A. That business is off and running and doing a great job, $30 million of normalization for incentive comp and equity. And then number three, I also want to leave this group with our long-term evergreen leverage targets remain in place. We have a stair step up in 1 year, but the behavior doesn't change going forward. And we've had consistent strong adjusted EPS growth, low double or high single-digit growth for a long time is the track record. Last year, we took a step back down 1.5%, but we're taking a step forward this year in and we expect that to have further steps forward as we move along. There is a first half, second half story. First half EPS is expect them to be down. Why? Because we had continued choppiness of our discretionary brands. We've kind of telegraphed that last quarter. We said for the next 6 months or so, we have continued happiness for those discretionary businesses like water pickles and even vitamins as we're lapping Omicron impacts. International supply challenges return to normal promotional levels and higher marketing dollars, have higher marketing spend year-over-year in the first half than the second half. And then the second half is impacted by improved productivity, improved global supply. We have volume growth. That was that chart I showed you earlier. Moving on to cash flow. Our free cash flow conversion for many, many years has been industry leading, on average, around 120%. And this past year, we're around 97%. Why is that? Because of the CapEx investment we're making in capacity, laundry, litter vitamins. And then in 2023, we'll also expect free cash flow conversion to be in the [90s]. How do we generate cash? Well, part of it is how we manage working capital. We've got from 52 days cash conversion cycle all the way down to 19 days. So overall, just extremely happy on how we've leveraged our balance sheet and improved our working capital. We took a stair step up in 2022 because we had elevated levels of inventory, primarily for our discretionary businesses. But as I -- as you heard in the Q4 release, we've improved those inventories. We still have more room to go, but we've improved those inventories. And then we have a really strong balance sheet. So we ended the year at 2.1x in 2022, and we're going to -- we expect to end the year at 1.7x. So we have plenty of firepower to do an incremental dealer deals. We have enough room to go up to $3.2 billion of a deal and stay and maintain our investment-grade rating.\nOkay. Just talking about capital allocation. Number one, we always talk about TSR acre M&A. We want to do the HERO deal. We want to do the THERABREATH deal again and again and again, those businesses are great. Those are the fast moving consumer goods that we're focused on that Matt just mentioned. CapEx organic growth. We'll talk more about that in a minute, NPD, debt reduction and return of cash to shareholders. So this is the capacity slide. laundry, litter, baking sorter vitamins, all have capacity projects in place, technology, sustainability, all those things help drive our organic growth. But overall, we're not a capital-intensive company. Look at a long track record for Church & Dwight. We're around 2% of sales. And in 2022, we took a step up to 3.3% as we started the investment cycle for laundry, litter and vitamins.\nIn 2023, we'll be around 4%, 4.5%. And then in 2024, we expect to stay a step down and then in 2025, we return to historical levels. That's our expectation. And then finally, our dividend increase, right? We had a 0% to 4% EPS outlook, and this is the high end of the range. We've been paying a dividend for many, many years, 122 consecutive years. And then finally, I'd like to turn it over to Barry, who's going to talk through MPD and how the U.S. consumer business is doing.\n\nBarry A. Bruno\n\nExecutive VP, CMO & President of Consumer Domestic, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Rick. Everybody, good afternoon. Nice to be back live with you here. I'm Barry Bruno. I lead our U.S. business, and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about our categories, our brands, a little bit about innovation and then a new marketing campaign. We call it give it the HAMMER. You might have noticed that when you walked in as we've wrapped the building in Orange today. So pretty good work there that I hope you like as much as we do. I may be biased as I lead the U.S. business, but I think our future is pretty bright. We're leaders in growing categories. I'll show you deeper what's going on in those categories in just a little bit, but we're #1 or #2 player in categories which are growing and healthy. We thrive in difficult environments. We've been through a lot over our 150-plus-year history and we thrive in those environments. We bring more consumers in. They stick with us as we emerge from them. And our acquisitions have a lot of room to run. I'm going to talk with you a little bit about ZICAM, a little bit about THERABREATH and about HERO. When I say that we're leaders in healthy growing categories, you can see what's going on here. Green means the category grew in that year, read, it contracted. You can see we've added a few new categories over the years as we bought brands in the cold shortening, mouthwash and acne patch categories, but healthy growth across each of those 6.4% weighted average last year.\nWe also know how to hold and grow share, right? 7 of 14 last year is not ideally where we want to be. We had supply challenges and a number of them that we -- that held us back from where we'd like to be. Ultimately, we plan to do far better as we go forward as we aspire to be better than 7 out of 14. That's going to happen as our supply chain improves, right? You can see here where we were last year, Q1 below 80% and improving throughout the year. Some of those supply challenges has made share growth difficult. But as we get into the new year ahead, you can see we're at 93%, growing to 97% through the course of the year. That's good not only for us. it's good for our retailers as we bring growth back to these categories where, again, we're the #1 or #2 player. And you saw this before, we like difficult environments. We do pretty well in challenging environments. Our portfolio split 40% value, 60% premium, allows us to bring new consumers in, in tough economic times and keep them. And as Matt said about private label, relatively low exposure, only 5 of 17 categories have material private label. This is a look at consumption in Q4. So in 13 of 17 categories in Q4, growth took place. You can see some categories that are new to us. If you look at the top cold shortening, if any of you navigated November, December without a cold, the cough, COVID, RSV, I commend you, many of your fellow compatriots here in the U.S. did not do as well, and you can see what drove category growth there. But what I like about this, categories that we've been in for a long time are growing, new categories are growing as well. So let's take a look at some of those categories that matter to Church & Dwight.\nFabric Care. Left-hand side, category growth, right? You can see category growth was 6%, 7%, moderating a little bit in Q3 when the consumer took a step back. And then you can see what church and with growth was on the right-hand side. So while we lagged the point in Q1, we grew faster in Q2, 3x faster than category in Q3 and Q4. And as you all know, when you're growing faster than category, you're gaining share and that led us to an all-time share high, 14.9% as we ended the year. And I want you to take away, that's part of a long-term trend, right? We were at 11.5% share in 2017. We're at 14.9% now consumers who try ARM & HAMMER, love the brand and stay with us over time. And we think that's only going to happen more in this environment, right? You can see where the consumer is trading down from premium into value, which is where ARM & HAMMER squarely sits and we're keeping those consumers, as you saw in our all-time share hide.\nLitter is another really important category. I'm going to talk to you about innovation in litter. But right now, let me show you where our existing business is double-digit growth each quarter last year, 14%, 12%, you can see what's going on there. And again, the story of share growth here in tough economic times, we're continuing to gain share. You can see where we've gained a point and change over the year. But really, what's going on our value orange box, cat litter is gaining material share again, if you look at Q3, Q4, when the consumer was most stressed and they were trying ARM & HAMMER litter they've moved to us and they're sticking with us. So another story about tough economic times in Church & Dwight persevering. And it's not just economic times that are tough, cough, cold, flu, again, RSV. We really like the addition of ZICAM to our portfolio. You can see over years on the left-hand side how the category has been moving, took a step back in 2021. But in 2022, as consumers were socializing and going out again masks were going away. The category bounced back and ZICAM share of cold shortening has built strength upon strengthens at a [77] share. And actually, if you look at the far right here, we exited in December a [78] share of the category. And again, this is an interesting chart on the left, right? That is influenza reports to the CDC just in November and December of 2022 versus the last 5 years, that gives you a little bit of flavor for how severe the cough/cold season was and flu this year. So that's good, and those are some important categories. We haven't even really talked about acquisitions yet. So I'm going to talk a little bit about mouthwash and acne care. As a reminder, we bought THERABREATH in December of 2021. We bought it HERO in October of 2022. So HERO has only been with us for 90 days. But it's a story of strength to strength and growth. New distribution for THERABREATH plus our WATERPIK (inaudible) outstanding growth and HERO is on the same path. Let me tell you a little bit more about each of those. So THERABREATH sales on the left here. So percentage growth year-over-year, you can see where that business was up 59%, 45%, 50%. Ultimately, though, that growth far faster than the category has led us to an [8%] share of the overall mouthwash market. We're at almost a [20%] share of the alcohol free mouthwash market category, subcategory, right? We're the #2 player there. We're growing as we're investing more in marketing and advertising and distribution. And speaking of distribution, when we last met with you guys, we talked about the huge runway that THERABREATH had. And you can see we're realizing some of that now up 60%, but we still trail all of our main competitors, Actin CREST and LISTERINE were way under skewed. And as a brand that retails for double the category average, we're at about a $10 price point versus a $5 average, retailers are happy to engage us with us in those conversations as we bring a lot of penny profit to the category. So a great track record for THERABREATH breath already, and that's going to continue into the future. HERO, our newest edition. The Acne pass category almost didn't exist 5 years ago. You can see $20 million in retail sales in 2018. It has grown dramatically to $340-plus million fueled by HERO. And you can see the percentage growth for HEROon the right-hand side in each month driving that category growth. And what's remarkable about that, I think HERO was only in distribution in bricks and mortar and Target and Ulta last year, right, on Amazon as well, but only target in Ulta. That's why you can see the TDPs are difficult to calculate even in terms of how small they were. All of that growth is ahead of us as we look to get our fair share and drive more growth, and we're going to be launching in all of the major bricks-and-mortar retailers that you'd expect starting with CVS now and more to come over the course of the year. So the summary for that section, right? They're great categories we compete in. They're growing. They're healthy. We're the #1 or #2 player in most of them. We thrive in difficult environments with the portfolio that's 40% value we bring consumers in and we keep them. And our most recent acquisitions have tons of room to run.\nAnd we haven't talked about innovation yet. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time on that. It might surprise you, I'm going to focus on cat litter. Because I think we've got something really noteworthy that our R&D group has created for us. The category, just to give you a look back, we started with our orange box products going back to 1998. We added Black Box, which is our premium back in 2016. We've had a 12% CAGR over decades in the business. That value cat litter, $280 million in retail sales, that's Orange box that's 1 pillar for us. Second pillar, [clump Seal], our premium price litter has been 80% incremental to us, and we think we're on the cusp of lasting our third pillar. We call it hard ball or lightweight litter perfected. Why do we care so much about lightweight later? Well, we've got a 25% share in the total clumping category. We've only got a 5% share in the lightweight category. And lightweight is about a 16% subcategory of the total category. So absolutely going after our fair share there, and we think hard ball is going to help us do it. What is hard ball. It's a new and different kind of litter. It's sorghum, which is a sustainable nonplay lightweight grain. We turn that into virtually indestructible clumps, which makes for easy no mess scoping. And I could tell you more about it, but I'm going to show you a video of some of our scientists having a little bit of fun that I think will bring it to life. Let's play the video, please.\n(presentation)\nI like the roof drop as the demo, right? That's a compelling one. Hopefully, that gave you a flavor to what hardball is all about. Again, category benefits, it's surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong, it's virtually indestructible clumps, makes cleaning the litter box of breeze. If you've had to clean the litter box at home, you know it's probably one of the least favorite household chores and hard ball makes it far, far easier. And it's sustainable, right? renewable, lightweight, easy to transport as well. So that's only one of our innovations. You can see in the top left corner. We've got innovation across laundry and condoms and acne patches and water flossers and vitamins near prep and smooth, by the way, a great new innovation that's going to make facial hair removal, far, far easier. (inaudible) Spin Brush and we're going to bring there breath to a whole new generation of mouthwash users as we launch our kids line. So lots of innovation across it. Carlos Linares can't be with us here today. He runs R&D and [Leslie Dribelvisis] here. That team has done a great job giving us as marketers incredible innovation to launch. Trying to tell you just about one more thing. We call it Give it to HAMMER. It's our new master brand campaign for ARM & HAMMER. You see it all around the building. And I don't know if technically, we're in a recession or not as judged by economist, but I can tell you our consumer, sure feels that we're in a recession. If you look at the top right-hand corner, that consumer is paying $396 a month more for goods this year than they were a year ago. And that's forcing them to make difficult decisions. 53% are making different choices. 90%, as you might imagine, are anxious and stressed about that. And I grabbed a spot from a consumer that was posted to here before we ever started this campaign, but this is the inspiration. When you worked hard to get a good job, but it doesn't even feel like it mattered. Gas is $5, rent increased by hundreds. Frozen chicken is $25. It's impossible to buy a home and inflation is so high that the Dollar Tree is now the $1.25 tree, right? That's what our consumer is dealing with, and they feel powerless about it. And it's leading to a wide open window for brand reconsideration. Brands that were on autopilot are now being reconsidered. If you look at the bar chart at the bottom right there, 46% of consumers according to a McKinsey study are shop in different brands and 42% plan to add them to their portfolio going forward. And we say, ARM & HAMMER is made for this moment, where the hard-working brand is packed with power, price to be accessible to all and eager to help. And we're launching a new campaign, a new video to consumers next week. We're going to share it with you now. Let's play the video.\n(presentation)\nSo we think right message, right brand, right time. We're going to be launching it to consumers on Monday. So you guys have got a sneak peek here. National TV, digital all the influence and social media you'd expect on e-retail and through PR. We're excited about the campaign. We think it's going to bring a whole new generation of consumers back into ARM & HAMMER and they're going to stick with us after. So thank you for your time. I'm going to turn it over to my partner in crime and the leader of all things digital, [Surabhi Pokereal]\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nHi, everyone. So good to see you. flatter to be here, leading digital Church & Dwight. My name is Surabhi Pokreal . So I would say digital acceleration is actually a stated and acted upon priority for us because this is a new section, I'll do a little bit state of the union of what the industry is seeing and then give color on what Church & Dwight is seeing. So you will notice here, we say 70% of all purchases in the U.S. are going to be digitally influenced by 2027. Just for context, 60% of all sales in 2023 are already digitally influenced. What that means is not just the sales that we do on Amazon, walmart.com, target.com and so on, but sales that are happening in brick-and-mortar because of how the consumer feels inspired to make decision in store using the digital knowledge they have. So when you're walking the target aisle and looking up a review on some other retailer, that's what we are calling digitally influenced sales. Similarly, the industry also tells us 81% of U.S. consumers are omnichannel shoppers. That is every channel shopper because the consumer doesn't discriminate online or brick-and-mortar. They just want the right -- drives the right value and the right product. And we know from the industry that consumers that shop both online and in-store have a larger basket size. One example on online, how the digital shelf changes, this is a gif image of every hour how our results change and how fund you will have volatile online digital shelf is it literally changes by the minute depending on what you're searching and how the results show up. So we aspire to win on those top 5 to 10 results, so our brands show up and the consumer needs us.\nThis is 1 example. We really want to be there where the eyeballs are. So in the last so many years, as we pivot to digital as our choice of channel to communicate with the consumer, be it social, search, programmatic. We want to make those authentic relatable relationships with the consumers and truly make it more edutainment. So while we are educating them, we are also entertaining them and not really throwing a media creative out explicitly. At the same time, the proverbial marketing funnel has so on flattened because the consumer has the right to go from inspiration liking a product, considering to buy it and actually buying it within milliseconds. So you will notice on the right, we are actually doing campaigns where consumers can go, be inspired about say, [Oxiclean] in this case and go buy it at a retailer of choice all from within the creative media. And we see millions of clicks happening that way and flattening the marketing funnel. Let's talk some numbers. Back in 2016, about 6 years back, only 2% of our sales were digital, e-commerce sales. We closed 2022 upwards of 16%. Of course, COVID accelerated this behavior because the consumer chose to buy online when they had no other options. But what we are seeing is when the consumer learns a new behavior you cannot take convenience back from them. It becomes a very sticky behavior, and we see sustained post-COVID momentum, and that's how we see digital sales accelerating for us for all our brands. Saying that we have a digital first ambition actually means that we are pivoting from digital being a capability builder to digital being a business builder. So we come with the commerce worst mindset. We spend a ton of media in overall marketing and a large part of that is digital media. We also are very cognizant that digital cannot be a function by itself, and we need to elevate all boats and which is why we're investing a ton of effort into training and educating \"traditional folks\" who may not have a digital responsibility and launching educational programs internally.\nThis is a good example of how in-store and online. We want to make sure that we win with the consumer when she is on her way and doing footfalls in the store. At the same time, we want to make sure our content online is truly thumb stopping. So that we win with her in every single channel. So in store, you want to be at eye level, easily reachable and have the right adjacency. But online, you want to have the right short-form videos, the product descriptions and so on. I'll give an example, like online, every keyword is actually an aisle in itself. So you type a litter, that's your endless aisle. You try in dry shampoo, that's your endless aisle, and we want to win in both of those isles, both in-store and online.\nPersonalization is also a big focus for us. We know that the consumer yearns for a one-to-one kind of connection, and we can no longer serve the same creative to every demographic. So in this example, a fantastic dry shampoo brand, the #1 in the U.S. and with the largest market share, we saw a ton of consumer engagement and much high purchase intent when we started doing creative, which is the right media, the right messaging for the right hair type. We also are conscious that digital being such a fast-moving area, we cannot just accelerate what we already do in digital, but also be mindful of what might come at the helm in the future of. On the left, you will see a lot of examples from [Dain] that is TikTok in China, and you have probably seen many examples of how live streaming is a huge thing in China, and we sold, say, 60,000 bottles BATISTE of but he's in under 5 minutes. At the same time, in the Western world, live streaming is a newer concept because it's not meant as much for social commerce as it is meant for social discovery. So we are partnering with a lot of retailers, Walmart, Amazon included, to see how might live streaming be a bigger concept, and we have experimented a decent amount in this. This keeps us at tip of the spare to make sure we do well, not just what we already do it well in digital, but find newer avenues to scale.\nOur current marketing spend of all the monies we spend in media, 70% is via digital channels. That is a big jump from -- if you see on the left-hand side, about until 2016, 2017, this number was 35%. So large part of the media used to be print, store and TV, where we just had a few asset types, each campaign. And now like Barry was showing, we have a variety of campaigns, everything from video, OTT, social, influencer retail media, of course, and audio that we are able to reach a variety of consumers with dozens of assets per campaign. So we are able to personalize the messaging at the cohort level and get better reach, sufficiency and of course, media ROI for that. All this cannot be done without raising the intellectual capital of the most priced asset in our company, that is our people. We are very committed to raising digital IQ of everybody within the organization and we launched large-scale digital commerce certification programs for not just the people who do digital day in and day out, but the traditional or analog marketers so that nobody will be analog anymore. Everybody has to jump on the digital bandwagon. I'll quote (inaudible) quickly here to say I scare to where the puck is going to be and not where it has been. That's exactly the sentiment will live and breathe in terms of digital acceleration in the company, be it consumer insights and analytics where we want to listen to the consumer using their ratings and reviews, consumer sentiment on social and design new product innovation or get back to them with the right solutions beat our acquisitions with digitally savvy brands like HERO and THERABREATH, who do a fantastic job at elevating all boats within the company. And having a one commercial team mindset where digital is truly a center of acceleration for Church & Dwight. So with that, I will pass it on to my peer in international, that also see the ton of digital acceleration. So that is Mike Reed.\n\nMichael G. Read\n\nEVP of International, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, [Ruby]. Great to be here. My name is Mike Great. I run the international and the SPD business for Church & Dwight. So I just want to take the next few minutes to talk about how we're doing in international. And then close with some just updates on our SPD business. So the international story. So from the Evergreen model, we're planning to grow 6% organically each year. And just to give you a little bit of a makeup of the business, we're about $900 million in sales, it's basically 2 different parts. We have our subsidiary markets, which are 6. This is a fully staffed, direct models that we have entities we sell directly to retail in Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Australia and Mexico. That's about 65% of our business. The other 35% runs through our Global Markets Group, which we call GMG. That's essentially -- we work with more than 400 partners and distributor partners around the world in over 100 countries. And then we've actually supported that with 5 regional offices China, Singapore, Panama, the U.K., and most recently, in Mumbai, India, which we opened in March of 2022. If you look back, we've got a very strong track record of growth against that 6% evergreen model going back to 2015. We did take a little bit of a step back in 2022. We've got really strong demand and orders in the system. We did have some supply challenges we referenced earlier in the presentation. And we did have some drag within our China market largely with some lockdowns and some [waterflow] contraction. But overall demand is really, really strong, and we've got a really strong track record.\nIf I unpack that a little bit, clearly, China has been a drag. But if you actually look at the -- our 6 subsidiary markets as well as 4 out of GMG regions. We have really strong positive growth across the board. Demand is really strong. Our portfolio is performing extremely well. I think as supply chain recoveries and as China starts to recover, we'll be poised to take advantage of that and get back on our evergreen model. The reason we have confidence in that, I'd say it's threefold. One is just the strength of our brand portfolio. Our brands travel extremely well across the world. can frame it up in 3 different ways. Traditionally, and certainly a big part of what we do today is we leverage our U.S. power brand. So ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, BMS, TROJAN, et cetera. Those brands travel extremely well across the globe. ARM & HAMMER across all segments is our single largest brand and some of those performed extremely well for us. But those are also complemented with a strong international portfolio in the personal care and OTC space, brands like [Sterimar] [Femfresh], (inaudible) are unique brands to the International division, high margin and our high-growth categories, we performed quite strongly there. And of course, we've taken great benefit from our acquisitions that, in many cases, our U.S.-based, we're adding their THERABREATH and HERO to the family in 2023. So really excited about those. So across the portfolio, those are kind of the 3 ways we look at it, but together, gives us a lot to play with internationally.\nThe second part is geographic expansion. So while we've got a great international story, we're still very early in our journey. If you look at most of our peer set, most of the revenues are in the 60% range outside of the U.S. We're in that 17% to 18% range. So we have a long runway to go, lots of geography, lots of brands to go into those geographies. So really excited about the runway ahead.\nAnd thirdly and equally important is we are making some key investments in the International division. So we continue to invest in e-commerce and digital maturity and growth Similarly, in pricing and revenue management we're adding some supply chain within our Asia community as well as putting infrastructure in people around quality, regulatory, R&D in some of our key emerging markets lay in the APAC region.\nSo overall, a very long runway of growth for international, very strong portfolio of brands. So it's really a matter of continuing to extend our portfolio into new geographies. We'll continue to leverage our acquisitions. THERABREATH and HERO will become really important brands for the portfolio. Most of our growth will continue to come from our global markets group and within our emerging markets, and we're going to continue to invest in key capabilities and resources as we continue to grow.\nAll right. Let's switch gears to Specialty Products. So Specialty Products is aimed to grow 5% organically each year. Just to kind of break that down, it's about a $350 million business. It grew almost 4% this year. 2021, we grew at 12%. It's broken up 2/3, 1/3 between Animal Nutrition, which is 69% and Specialty Chemicals at 31%. The animal productivity is largely prebiotics, probiotics, and food processing safety. It's all under the ARM & HAMMER master brand. So we have a whole host of product lines in order to service the animal productivity space. And just if you go back to 2015, international was not a big part of the business. We have made a conservative effort to move into our global markets, not too similar to our consumer business. 2022, it's 12%, and we'll continue to grow our international footprint. But as we grow our international footprint, we're also going into new species as well. So what used to be largely a dairy business is now cattle, swine and poultry as well. So diversifying also the specie range.\nSo with that, this is probably the last time we'll show this slide. If you go back in history, we often had sort of our dairy business and our own productivity is largely linked to the fluctuations in milk prices. Since we've diversified in terms of our species to include dairy cattle and swine and also are moving internationally, we've been able to smooth out our revenue. So we won't have the ups and down cyclical effect that we've had in past years. So this will be the last time we showed this chart, but I think it's an important context to have much stable revenues moving forward on SPD.\nSo overall, trusted brand from a Church & Dwight, but also ARM & HAMMER umbrella brand, both in the animal nutrition and the specialty chemicals. We're very aligned with kind of key trends around prebiotics, probiotics and available and affordable proteins. We've got a diversified around multiple species, and we're growing internationally. So for all those reasons, we're pretty excited about where SPD is headed as well as international. So with that, I will hand back over to Matt Farrell.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.",
    "content2": "Okay. All right. Thanks, Mike. I can try to bring it home here. You haven't seen this slide before, we talk about how we run the company. And this is a snapshot of our consumer business. We have 7 SPUs. You see the first 6 on the left side or the U.S. businesses on international and the far right. So this is how we break down all the brands that we manage and we manage dozens of brands, but you see most of the power brands are listed here. Maybe wondering why ARM & HAMMER appears for Fabric Care, Home Care and Personal Care. In Fabric Care, we have an ARM & HAMMER detergent.\nIn Home Care, we have baking soda and litter. And over in Personal Care, we have a toothpaste and under armed et cetera. But we got -- these are all broken down into very manageable businesses. And over an international, as Mike just described, too. We have 1/3 of the business is the GMG, our export business and 2/3 is the subsidiaries Okay. So here are 5 operating principles, which I'm going to kind of walk through. The first thing is leverage brands. So we focus on brands that consumers love. It's not brands consumers like. It's brands consumers love. They're going to stick with you are going to walk out of the store, looking for your brand. The second thing is we've been a long-time friend of the environment.\nThis company was founded in 1846, and the founders of the company were environmentalists and that's continuing to stay. Leverage people I'm going to talk about. We have a wonderful group of people in our company. We have 5,200 employees. We have over $5 billion in sales. We have over $1 million of sales per employee and leverage assets, many of you who are long-term holders now that we're focused on being asset-light. And finally, if you do the first 4 right, you get good returns, but if you're able to make smart acquisitions, integrate them and grow them, you're going to get great returns. And that's what we have gotten over the years. Okay.\nLeverage brands already mentioned that. We have 14 power brands that make up 85% of our leverage -- of our sales and profits. Friend of the environment, and we'll go in a little bit deeper on that. So you've probably seen this before. It's a good reminder that if you went back to the 19th century, we were putting trading cards in our boxes of baking soda. And those cards were pictures of birds. And they said, save the birds, save the planet. In 1907, we started to use recycled paperboard in our cartons. No one was doing that back then. We were the first to take phosphates of laundry detergent back in the '70s. And we were the first and only sponsor of the first Earth Day. And 20 years later, in 1990, Church & Dwight was still the only corporate sponsor for Earth Day.\nMore recently, we started plant trees in the Mississippi River Valley. It's trying to offset the carbon docs that we put into the air. And if I go all over to the far right, we now we're committed to science-based targets. So when you plant trees, you remember from fifth grade science you take 2 out of the atmosphere, and science-based targets, what we're focusing on is spending money on CapEx to reduce the amount of CO2 we put into the atmosphere. All right. So here are some of our goals. So you say we aim to be 100% carbon neutral by 2025. That means we will have planned enough trees since 2016 to offset all the CO2 we put into the atmosphere. And it's pretty considerable.\nFor a small company like ours, we put 350,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually. So this is really important to us. You see the mention of science-based targets below there. What are we trying to reduce water usage 10% annually and then solid waste recycling, we'd like to recycling 75% of the solid waste from all of our sites. We got a lot of recognition about that, the [FTSE], EPA Green Power. Safer Choice partner, we've been a safer choice partner for the past 7 years.\nAnd this is important to our management team. It's important to our employees. It's important to the families of our employees as well, but it's also important to our consumers. So you can see, it's really a top priority for so many consumers today, particularly younger consumers. All right. The fifth principle is to leverage people. So we say we have highly productive people and a place where people matter. When you invest in a company, you bet on people, and you bet ideas. And their ability to execute those ideas. And I can tell you, we have a really strong management team. But it's not just the management team. It's also the 5,000 people that we have in our company. those people are in supply chain. It's 60% of the company. That is the backbone of Church & Dwight. And when you think about what's the culture in Church & Dwight.\nAny member of our management team could take you through this. It's a blue-collar company. That's not a dress code thing. This is how you will go to work every day. It's a roll up your sleeves environment. We've got a lot of high-aptitude people in the company. Many of them have worked in other large CPG companies. Wanted to go smaller where they could make a difference. So it's blue collar, high aptitude, underdog. So we compete against companies that are far, far larger than us and you know who they are.\nWe never use that as an excuse. And we beat these big companies every day. The fourth thing is getting the facts. So we -- it's a company we're maniacal about numbers and data -- and 1 point of time, people made decisions based on the person who had the gray hairs in the room, the gray beards like me. So I know best, I've got 40 years experience, no more. That is not how business is done. Now it's done based on data, and we are oriented towards data, and we have data sciences in the company now, and we're becoming more and more focused on predictive analytics. Just to kind of round it out, digitally savvy is something that's very important to us.\nThat's something we've focused on over the past 5 or 6 years. Diversity is the last one -- second lesson. And finally, it's take risks. We want to be risk takers in the company. The way we illustrate that, we actually have a picture of Johnny Depp from Pirates of the Caribbean that we use when we're talking about this internally and say, \"Hey, this is who we are.\" So I just want to give you a little bit of background on that. And here's some numbers. Here's all of our competitors and here's our revenue per employee. And I think this is an underappreciated statistic when it comes to investing.\nWe get mix. It makes a big difference when you've got fewer people, you get focused on fixing things, making things better, and it's magic.\nAll right. We have a civil compensation structure in the company. Many of you know from following us for many years, it's revenue, gross margin, cash and EPS. and what that does is it makes the company financially literate. So when we're talking about gross. We're talking about gross margin in every part of the company. When I go into a plant, we have 15 plants. We do town halls with all 3 shifts. We'll talk about gross margin. What is it? How do you get it? It's part of our compensation. And then as far as how do you get gross margin? It was good to great is the name of our productivity program. it's a book that everybody has heard about, probably no one's read, but that's the name we use to describe our productivity program.\nSupply chain optimization, that's also how do we run our plants, what kind of capital we're putting in our plants which plants should we make a product that new products, if you introduce new products that have higher gross margins, it's going to help you as well. And then finally, acquisition synergies. We like to buy businesses that have gross margins that are at or higher than our current gross margins.\nAll right, leverage assets. Rick took you through this before. We pride ourselves on being asset-light. And historically, we've been around 2% of sales. It spiked back in 2009 when we built our gigantic plant in New York, Pennsylvania. It's spiking more recently because we're investing in so many different categories. But that's a good signal. You don't put in new capacity if you don't think you're going to grow. So we're going to be able to fill that up over the next couple of years.\nAll right. And finally, leverage acquisitions. I mentioned that before. If you do that well, you can turn good returns into great returns. All right. And I just want to repeat the acquisition criteria in case you missed it previously. So we invest in brands that are #1 or #2 in their category. You're not going to see us invest in a brand that's #4 -- 4 or 5 and tell you the investor, we're going to drive that to number one. That's not going to happen. The brands are #1 or #2 for reasons. That's what we focus on. They need to be high growth, high margin and fast-moving consumables.\nAsset-light is our preference. We want to be able to leverage our substantial footprint around the world. And again, needs to have a long-term competitive advantage. So with respect to cash, we have 14 brands today, we are like 20 tomorrow. I just want to kind of end on the look ahead. So you saw in the release, we said, \"Hey, we got strong fundamentals going into 2023.\"We got top line strength, both reported and organic. We got gross margin expansion. We've got a terrific new product pipeline, you only heard about one today, but there are many others as well. We're jacking the investment in advertiser. That's going to help us not only in '23, but in future years. Rick took you through the capacity expansion. And finally, we generate lots of cash. And so we're on the hunt for our next power brand. And with that, I'm going to bring up the rest of the management team, and we'll do some Q&A play stump the band for a little while. All right. Come on up gang."

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We've got lots to talk about. I'm going to begin with a review of Q3 results. Then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call for questions.\nFirst off, I'll say, we revised our full year revenue outlook in early September, and we're tracking to hit 3%, which was the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range at that time.\nIn Q3, reported revenue was up 0.4%, and that exceeded our expectation of minus 1%.\nAs you read in the release, while the majority of our brands are performing well. We have 3 businesses that are coloring our results this year. And those are WATERPIK, our vitamin business, and FLAWLESS. And those businesses account for -- accounted for a 6% sales headwind in Q3.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.76. Now this was $0.11 higher than our EPS outlook, driven by higher international sales, lower SG&A and timing of marketing spend.\nThe U.S. portfolio grew consumption in 11 of 17 categories. The trade down to value laundry detergent continued as ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent achieved an all-time high market share of 14.3%.\nThe ARM & HAMMER clumping litter, BATISTE dry shampoo and THERABREATH mouthwash also achieved all-time high market shares.\nTROJAN condoms returned to share growth and OXICLEAN stain fighters and ARM & HAMMER baking soda delivered double-digit consumption growth.\nThe strong performance of these businesses is offsetting the impact of the discretionary businesses and vitamins on reported sales.\nIn Q3, our most discretionary brands, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, which account for approximately 10% of our global sales were impacted by lower customer spending. Similarly, the gummy vitamin category, in which our VITAFUSION brand competes, was impacted by a decline in consumption as fewer households purchased vitamins and supplements and we were also lapping the COVID Delta variant in the prior year quarter.\nIn Q3, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 15%, and we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15%.\nNow I'm going to comment on each business. First up is the U.S. U.S. consumer, which had 1.7% organic sales decline. Looking at market share, 7 of our 14 power brands held or gained share. Looking ahead, we expect even further improvement in our market share positions in Q4 as we expect our highest fill rates of the year and our highest quarterly promotional and marketing spend.\nI want to look at a few of the important categories in the U.S., and I want to start with laundry. The trade down to value detergent which began in Q2 continued in Q3. During Q3, the liquid laundry category grew 3.1%. Now if we break that down, value laundry detergent grew 9%, premium declined 3%. ARM & HAMMER unit dose also benefited from the trade down. Our ARM & HAMMER pods grew consumption by 25% in the quarter compared to unit dose category growth of 4.5%. With more consumers migrating to ARM & HAMMER, the long-term benefit to the ARM & HAMMER brand similar to the last recession.\nIn litter, the category grew 11%, while ARM & HAMMER litter grew 14%, so we gained share in the quarter. Both our black box, which is premium, and our yellow box, which is value, had double-digit consumption growth in Q3.\nIn stain fighters, OXICLEAN gained share as consumption was up 10%, while the category grew 7%.\nThe dry shampoo category was up 18% in Q3, driven by BATISTE consumption, which was up 37%, and we now enjoy a 46% market share in dry shampoo.\nThe condom category was up 3.5% in Q3, while TROJAN consumption was up 4.5%. So again, we gained 60 basis points of market share, thanks to our new TROJAN BARESKIN RAW condom and the success of more targeted marketing.\nOur most recent acquisitions are performing well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December of 2021, had a great quarter with 46% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share of 4.3 points to 17.8% of the alcohol-free mouthwash category. THERABREATH is the #2 nonalcohol mouthwash and the clear #4 brand in total mouthwash. THERABREATH is expected to be a long-term grower for Church & Dwight in the future.\nZICAM also delivered strong results this quarter. You may recall, we acquired ZICAM in December of 2020. ZICAM is the #1 brand in the cold shortening segment with a 76% share in Q3.\nNow looking ahead to Q4, the regular flu season in the U.S. is projected to be far more severe than recent years. And as a reminder, approximately 40% of ZICAM consumption happens in Q4.\nWe closed on our latest acquisition, Hero, in mid-October. Now while we did that own Hero in Q3, the brand performed extremely well, growing consumption 56% and gaining 3.6 share points to achieve a 14% market share in the total acne treatments category. There's a great deal of excitement here about this business as we look ahead to 2023 and longer term.\nAll right. Next up is International. Our international business delivered organic growth of 3.2% in Q3, primarily driven by the international subsidiaries, which posted strong growth in the quarter.\nOn the other hand, our Global Markets Group has been impacted by weakening demand in China due to lockdowns, and we expect this to continue in Q4.\nFinally, Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered 1% organic growth in the quarter. But keep in mind that the 1% organic growth is on top of 18.5% organic growth in Q3 2021.\nNow I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing our 2 discretionary brands, WATERPIK and FLAWLESS, which have longer purchase cycles. And after that, I'll talk about the vitamin business.\nFirst, WATERPIK. So WATERPIK is the #1 brand in water flossers. We continue to see lower dollar consumption for water flossers in the U.S. However, WATERPIK unit volumes are actually positive both in Q3 and year-to-date as consumers trade down to lower-priced cordless models.\nIf we look back at 2021 and 2020, the consumer was healthier and a good portion of our growth came from our super premium products like Sonic-Fusion. In 2022, the decline in our flosser sales is driven by trade down and inventory reductions by retailers. Shipments for full year 2022 are expected to decline approximately 20% as retailers reset their inventories and product mix.\nWe continue to invest in demand-driving activities for WATERPIK, such as Lunch & Learns with dentists and hygienists to drive household penetration of flossers. And in 2023, next year, we expect to return to pre-pandemic levels for Lunch & Learns.\nNow remember, WATERPIK is the Kleenex of water flossers and 9 out of 10 dentists recommend the product by its brand name. This is extremely important as 60% of consumer purchases are driven by a recommendation from a dental professional. It's fair to say that gum health is not going away and still only 16% of the U.S. population flosses every day.\nNow looking back, WATERPIK averaged high single-digit top line growth from 2017 when we acquired the business through 2021. So we're taking a big step back in 2022, but we're confident that the long-term growth prospects for WATERPIK are sound.\nNow the other discretionary brand we have is FLAWLESS, which is the #1 brand in women's health hair removal. We're experiencing lower consumption in this category which resulted in higher inventories at retail. Our share has been further hurt by the delay in launching new products caused by the China lockdowns at our supplier.\nAfter the conclusion of a 30-month earn-out period, which ended in 2021, our marketing team took over the front end of the business and has been narrowing the product assortment to the winners. So if you're familiar with the brand, that's Face, Brow, Mani and Pedi. And we're also shifting the focus from older consumers to digital targeting of younger consumers in the beauty space. Now we believe these changes will have a positive impact on the long-term prospects for the business.\nNow finally, over in VMS, we have the #1 adult gummy vitamin. Category consumption is being impacted as temporary consumers who were interested in prevention during COVID times have exited the category.\nBeyond category dynamics, the VITAFUSION brand has also lost some share due to our lower fill rates, particularly earlier in the year.\nIt's clear that fewer households are purchasing vitamins and supplements post COVID, and the category is being impacted by the recession. So here are some stats. For the last 3 quarters, the category growth rate has been plus 10% in Q1, plus 5% in Q2, and most recently minus 8% in Q3. Now the minus 8% compares to a plus 33% increase in the category in Q3 2021.\nAnd there is some good news here. In the first few weeks of October, the rate of category decline has moderated to minus 4%. And longer term, the transition from pills and capsules to gummy vitamins gives us confidence in the long-term appeal of the gummy category.\nAnd I'll conclude with a few takeaways that I'd like to leave you with. The majority of our business is strong. We believe the 3 brands that are coloring our numbers have good, long-term prospects. Case fill is now over 90% and improving. We've ramped up our marketing and trade promotion investment in the second half, especially in Q4, and we have confidence in our Q4 outlook.\nNow I'm going to turn it over to Rick to give you more details on Q3.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Head of Business Operations, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Third quarter EPS was $0.76, down 5% to prior year. The $0.76 was better than our $0.65 outlook primarily due to higher sales, lower SG&A expense and timing of marketing spend.\nReported revenue was up 0.4%, including a 1% drag from currency. Revenue was higher than our outlook of minus 1%.\nOrganic sales declined 0.7% as volume was down 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%.\nMatt reviewed the top line for the segments, so I will go right to gross margin for the company. Our third quarter gross margin was 41.7%, a 250 basis point decrease from a year ago.\nLet me walk you through the Q3 bridge. Gross margin was impacted by 580 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodity inflation, distribution and labor. These costs were offset by a positive 190 basis point impact, largely from pricing; positive 20 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 120 basis points from productivity.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was down $20 million year-over-year, although this was a significant increase of $40 million sequentially from our first half 2022 levels of 8% of sales, as our fill rates have improved. Fill rates in Q3 were 91%, and we expect further improvement in Q4.\nMarketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 10.7% in the quarter. We expect continued increase in marketing spend in Q4 to approximately 13% of net sales.\nFor SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year.\nOther expense all-in was $19.4 million, a $7.3 million increase resulting from higher average outstanding debt levels and higher interest rates.\nAnd for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 20.2% compared to 20.4% a year ago.\nAnd now to cash. For the first 9 months of 2022, cash from operating activities decreased $119.5 million to $534 million due primarily to higher inventory levels from WATERPIK, FLAWLESS and vitamin. We expect inventory levels to come down over the next 12 months.\nAnd as of September 30, cash on hand was $438 million.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 2%, organic sales decline of approximately 1% and gross margin contraction. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.58 to $0.62 per share, a 3% to 9% decrease from last year's adjusted Q4 EPS. This decline is primarily due to significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 25% versus an unusually low tax rate in the prior year of 3.7%, which was largely due to a high number of stock option exercises a year ago.\nTurning to the full year, we expect the full year outlook for reported sales growth to be approximately 3%, the midpoint of our previously 2% to 4% range.\nWe expect organic sales growth to be approximately 1%. The strong consumption across most of our businesses in 2022 has offset the slowdown in discretionary brands, as Matt talked about.\nWe now expect full year adjusted EPS to be $2.93 to $2.97, a decline of 2% to 3% compared to 2021. The range is influenced by the extent of margin mix within the portfolio.\nWe continue to expect the full year tax rate to be 23%.\nAnd we now expect cash from operations for the full year to be approximately $800 million.\nAnd our full year CapEx plan is now approximately $170 million as we continue to expand manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future growth in laundry and litter.\nIn closing, we continue to perform in a volatile environment. We expect further market share gains in Q4 as we invest in our brands and our supply chain fill levels continue to improve.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.",

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Financial Officer (sic) [Chief Executive Officer] of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nActually, I got promoted as CEO about 7 years ago. But anyway, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We've got a lot to talk about. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call for questions.\nSo Q2 was a solid quarter for us. Reported revenue was up 4.2%. Organic sales grew 3.4%, and this was in line with our 3% to 4% outlook. The adjusted EPS was $0.76. Now this was $0.06 higher than our outlook, but that was due to lower marketing.\nWe grew consumption in 11 of our 17 categories in which we compete and, in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year. Fill rates have improved to 90% in June, and we expect to get back to historical levels by the end of the year.\nRegarding brand performance, we experienced double-digit consumption growth in 6 of our 17 categories, and I'll name them for you: ARM & HAMMER Scent Boosters, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, ARM & HAMMER Clumping Litter, BATISTE dry shampoo, ZICAM zinc supplements and THERABREATH mouthwash. And we gained share on 8 of our 14 power brands. So that's a good story. Our shares are healthy.\nIn Q2, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 16%. Our online sales increased 15% year-over-year, and we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of sales.\nSince early '21, we have announced price increases to combat inflation. And through mid-2022, we have already announced price increases covering 80% of our global portfolio. And we did a second round of price increases in laundry and litter that just hit the shelves. But at the same time, cost inflation continues to climb. So since we spoke to you in April, we are now expecting $50 million of new incremental cost inflation. So the cumulative incremental cost inflation is $135 million since we gave our initial full year outlook way back in February.\nNow the incremental $50 million of inflation, combined with currency headwinds, caused us to lower our full year EPS outlook. We now expect 6% operating income growth, offset by a much higher year-over-year tax rate.\nNow I'm going to comment on each business. First up is U.S. consumer business, which grew organic sales by 2.4%. Looking at market shares, as I said before, we had good numbers as 8 of our 14 power brands gained share. Looking ahead, we expect even further improvement in our market share positions by year-end as our fill rates will improve and promotional and marketing spend increases in the back half.\nLet's look at a few of the important categories. Let's start with laundry. The trade down to value detergent has begun. Give you some numbers. For example, during Q2, the liquid laundry category grew 7%, but value laundry detergent grew 11%, while premium laundry grew 4%.\nIn litter, the category grew 12%. Both our black box, which is premium and our yellow box, which is value, had double-digit consumption growth in Q2. The dry shampoo category was up 18% in Q2, while BATISTE consumption was up 43%. Our growth would have been higher, if not for our difficulty in securing aerosol cans and actuators.\nOver in gummy vitamins, the sequential quarterly growth of the category is slowing down. For the last 3 quarters, the category growth rate has been 16%, 10% and most recently, 5%. We expect the category growth to turn negative in Q3, simply because we are lapping the consumption spike from the Delta variant in last year's Q3. And we continue to struggle with fill rate, which is hampering our ability to grow.\nOur most recent acquisitions are performing well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December 2021, had a great quarter with 33% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share 3.1 points to 16.4% of the alcohol-free mouthwash category. THERABREATH is the #2 non-alcohol mouthwash and is solidly the #4 brand in total mouthwash.\nZICAM is our other recent acquisition. ZICAM also delivered strong results this quarter. You may recall, we acquired ZICAM in December of 2020. We were hurt in year 1 of our ownership due to masking and social distancing. ZICAM cold remedy consumption was up 55% in Q2 and is the #1 brand in the cold shortening segment with a 75% share. Now looking ahead to the rest of the year, the regular flu season in the U.S. is projected to be more severe than recent years based on what the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing right now.\nNext up is international. Despite significant disruptions, our international business delivered organic growth of 6.5% in Q2, primarily driven by BATISTE in Europe, vitamins and BATISTE in Canada and growth across the GMG business, which is our export business.\nIn April, when we spoke to you, we expected flattish growth in Q2 and a continuation of the supply chain woes we experienced in Q1, such as fill level issues and delivery issues. Those actually proved to be less disruptive in the quarter than we anticipated. However, fill levels and delivery issues will continue to weigh on our Global Markets Group in the near term.\nNext up is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a strong quarter with 6.3% organic growth driven by both higher price and volume.\nNow I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing our more discretionary brands since they are having an impact on our full year revenue outlook. We see lower consumption for water flossers in the U.S. as consumers trade down to lower-priced water flossers. Also the WATERPIK Asia Pacific flosser consumption has and is expected to decline as a result of lockdowns.\nSimilarly, there is a lower demand for WATERPIK Shower Heads, and this is due to less do-it-yourself projects. A lot of those got completed during COVID times. WATERPIK is a discretionary purchase, and we continue to invest in demand-driving activities such as launch and learns to drive household penetration of flossers.\nIt's fair to say gum health has not gone away and still only 16% of the U.S. population flosses every day. Now this is a business that has averaged high single-digit growth top line since we acquired them in 2017. And we're confident that the long-term growth prospects for WATERPIK are sound.\nThe other discretionary brand we have is FLAWLESS. We're experiencing lower consumption, but that is largely due to the absence of our new products in this fast-moving beauty category. China lockdowns have impacted our manufacturing, and the new product launches that were planned for the first half have been delayed until the end of '22.\nNow I want to spend a few minutes on the health of the consumer, private label trends, innovation and our ability to supply. Innovation is at a multi-decade high, and interest rates are rising to tamp down inflation and while wages have risen, households are getting squeezed and the consumers are making choices to make their dollars go further.\nAnd I think back to April during our Q1 call, we called out the strengthening value detergent segment. In the latest 4 weeks ended July 17, value liquid laundry detergent category is up 8%, deep value is up 1%, and premium is down 1%. So we think the trade down is happening.\nHere's another an early indicator of trade down, this time in oral care. We had one major retailer point to the strength of manual toothbrush, which has held up well for them in contrast to declines in rechargeable and power toothbrushes. This trend impacts both WATERPIK and SPINBRUSH, and here are a few numbers to illustrate the trend.\nThe flosser category was down 7% in Q2. And battery-operated toothbrushes, the category was down 4% also in Q2. So we're keeping an eye on these and other trends. It's important to point out that 40% of our portfolio is value, and we expect to perform well in a difficult economic environment.\nOur largest businesses, detergent and vitamins, are value products. And in litter, our orange box is also valued. So we feel well positioned for what may be coming. Now regarding private label. Private label shares are stable in the 5 categories where we have meaningful exposure to store brands. As you saw in the release, we have a strong lineup of innovation across our personal care and household categories.\nI want to highlight the early success of ARM & HAMMER baby laundry detergent, which has already achieved a 10% share of the baby laundry category at Walmart. The other product I'd like to highlight is TROJAN RAW, which is the thinnest condom now in the market, which is already the #6 out of 400 SKUs sold at Amazon.\nI also want to mention our recent launch of a new lightweight litter that we call Hardball. We expect, over time, this will enable us to get our fair share of the lightweight litter category. For the cat owners on the call today, we named it Hardball because of the hard ultracompact clumps. It's quite a unique consumer experience.\nNow regarding ability to supply, you may recall, we hit bottom in Q1 with the Omicron resurgence when we saw our fill rates dip below 80%. The overall Q2 fill rates improved to 89%, although recovery in our high-margin personal care side of the business is still lagging.\nWe're on track to be near historical fill levels by the end of the year, and the good news is July continues to show improvement. Now we have confidence in our revised full year outlook for several reasons: improving fill rates, trade down to value, healthy new product innovation and consumption strength in our recent acquisitions.\nRegarding support, we have key promotional events lined up in the second half, and 2/3 of our full year advertising spend is concentrated in the second half. In closing, we expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times, and we continue to hunt for new TSR-accretive acquisitions.\nNext up is Rick to give you more details on Q2.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Head of Business Operations, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.76, flat to prior year. The $0.76 was better than our $0.70 outlook primarily due to continued strong consumer demand and lower marketing spend due to below normal fill rates in our personal care business. The market impact was about $0.04 in the quarter. Good news is our overall fill rate continued to show improvement and hit 89% for Q2.\nReported revenue was up 4.2%, reflecting a 1% drag from currency. Organic sales were up 3.4%, in line with our outlook. Matt reviewed the top line for the segment, so I will go right to gross margin for the company.\nOur second quarter gross margin was 41.2%, a 220 basis point decrease from a year ago. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin was impacted by 600 basis points of higher manufacturing costs primarily related to commodity inflation, distribution and labor as well as a 10 basis point drag from currency. These costs were offset by a positive 270 basis point impact from price volume mix, positive 20 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 100 basis points from productivity.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was down $14 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.8%, and we expect 2/3 of advertising to be concentrated in the second half as case fill improves.\nFor SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 10 basis points year-over-year. Other expense all-in was $15.1 million, a $3.7 million increase resulting from higher average debt outstanding. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.1% compared to 24% a year ago.\nAnd now to cash. For the first 6 months of 2022, cash from operating activities decreased 10% to $310 million due to lower cash earnings and higher working capital driven by higher inventory levels. We expect inventory to get back in line by year-end. And as of June 30, cash on hand was $640 million. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 2% to 4%, organic sales growth of approximately 1% to 3% and gross margin contraction.\nSequentially, we are decelerating from Q2 as our VMS business comps to COVID surge from a year ago, and we see a tightening in the consumer for our discretionary products such as WATERPIK and FLAWLESS. Those 2 reasons, coupled with the inventory issues we've all heard from retailers, compress Q3 growth.\nAdjusted EPS is expected to be $0.65 per share, a 19% decrease from last year's adjusted Q3 EPS. This is largely due to higher SG&A, which is normalized levels of incentive comp versus a year ago plus higher marketing and promotional support. We expect higher EPS in Q4 to offset the Q3 declines driven by acceleration of organic growth in the absence of prior year onetime investments.\nAnd now to the full year. We now expect the full year outlook for reported sales growth to be approximately 4% to 6%, reflecting an incremental drag from currency of 1%. We now expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%. As you read in the release, we now expect an incremental $135 million of cost inflation for the year, which is $50 million higher than our April outlook.\nOn a longer time horizon, we continue to plan on offsetting inflation with incremental pricing, laundry compaction and productivity. We continue to anticipate full year reported gross margin to be down versus 2021 as inflation is partially offset by pricing and productivity. We continue to expect gross margin to improve sequentially in Q3 and increase year-over-year in Q4.\nMarketing spend is now expected to be lower in 2022 driven by the lower spend in the first half of the year. We now expect full year adjusted EPS to be flat to 2021 due to incremental inflation and currency headwinds. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be 23%. We expect cash from operations for the full year to be approximately $900 million, down from $920 million, and our full year CapEx plan is now approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing capacity.\nIn closing, we continue to perform in a volatile environment. Our share performance improved again in Q2, and we expect further market share gains in the second half as we invest in our brands and supply chain fill levels improve.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.",

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church & Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Thomas Farrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nOkay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open the call for questions.\nQ1 was a solid quarter for us. Reported revenue was up 4.7%, organic sales grew 2.7%, and we exceeded our 1% to 2% Q1 outlook for organic growth. The adjusted EPS was $0.83 and that's $0.08 better than our outlook. We grew consumption in 11 of the 17 categories in which we compete and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year. This is remarkable as our low fill rates held back our consumption. The good news is April fill rates across many categories are now mid to high 80s and improving.\nRegarding brand performance, our brands saw a double-digit consumption growth in 7 of those categories, and I'll name them for you. ARM & HAMMER Scent Boosters, ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, ARM & HAMMER Clumping Litter, BATISTE dry shampoo, WATERPIK Water Flossers, ZICAM zinc supplements and THERABREATH mouthwash. In Q1, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 16%. Our online sales increased 2.6% year-over-year. Now keep in mind, this is on top of 53% growth in e-commerce that we experienced last year in Q1 versus 2020. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of total sales.\nNow since early '21, we have announced price increases to combat inflation. And through early 2022, we had already announced price increases covering 80% of our global portfolio. Since we spoke to you last in January, we are now expecting $85 million of new incremental cost inflation. And as a result, we recently announced another round of price increases on our Fabric Care and Litter products, which will be effective in July of this year. In addition to pricing, we are pursuing additional measures to offset higher-than-expected costs such as productivity and pack size changes. Also in laundry, you may know, we have now concentrated our portfolio by approximately 10%.\nNow I'm going to talk about each business and first up is the Consumer business in the U.S. Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.7%, and this is on top of 5.1% organic growth in Q1 of '21. Looking at market shares in Q1, 7 of our 14 power brands gained share. Our most recent acquisitions are performing well. THERABREATH, which we acquired in December of '21, had a great quarter with 37% consumption growth. THERABREATH grew share of 3.6 points to 15% of the alcohol-free mouthwash category, and Q1 was the first full quarter in which THERABREATH surpassed ACT as the fourth largest mouthwash brand and THERABREATH remains the #2 alcohol-free mouthwash brand. Total distribution points, or TDPs, as we call them, for the THERABREATH brand are up 20% versus a year ago.\nZICAM also delivered strong results this quarter. You may recall we acquired ZICAM at December of 2020. We were hurt in year 1 of our ownership due to masking and social distancing. ZICAM cold remedy consumption was up 56% in Q1, and we expanded our share of the cold shortening segment to a little over 75% share.\nTurning to Gummy Vitamins. Total shipments of VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS were relatively flat in the quarter. Demand for gummies remained high as the category consumption grew 11%, but our case fill was low. So we left money on the table in Q1. The good news is our fill rates, also in vitamins are finally starting to improve.\nNext up is International. Despite significant disruptions, our International business did deliver some organic growth in Q1, 0.3%, primarily driven by STERIMAR, BATISTE, OXICLEAN and VMS in the Global Markets Group. Lockdowns and transportation issues hurt our results. We have the orders, we're just struggling to fill them. We expect our difficulties to abate in the second half in International.\nNext up is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a strong quarter with 9.2% organic growth driven by both higher pricing and volume. I want to spend a few minutes on the health of the consumer, private label trends, innovation and our ability to supply. Now we all know that inflation is at a multi-decade high, interest rates are rising to tamp down inflation. And while wages have risen, households are getting squeezed, and we expect consumers will start to make choices to make their dollars go further.\nWe have seen Netflix lose subscribers, but here are a few indicators that we're seeing. First, consumption of value detergent was flat year-over-year in Q1, and this is after losing share to premium detergent for several quarters. Over in Cat Litter, our traditional ARM & HAMMER orange box Cat Litter which is a value product, grew faster than our premium ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter in Q1.\nOver in Personal Care, WATERPIK is seeing faster growth of lower priced price point models in the flosser business. And then in showerhead, showerhead category consumption is slowing, which may be an indicator that consumers may be spending less on home improvement. Now we're keeping an eye on these trends, and we are prepared if categories become more promotional in the second half. It's important to point out that 40% of our portfolio is valued and we expect to perform well in a difficult economic environment. And just to remind everyone, our largest businesses -- larger detergent and vitamins, are value products. And in litter, our orange box is also valued. So we feel well positioned for what may be coming.\nNow regarding private label. Private label shares are stable in the 5 categories where we have meaningful exposure to store brands. As you saw in the release, we have a strong lineup of innovation across our personal care and household categories. Most of these new products are shipping in Q2, and we believe our consumer is always attracted to new and improved product offerings. Regarding our ability to supply, we hit bottom early in Q1 with the Omicron resurgence, and we saw our fill rates dip below 80%. As I mentioned earlier, April fill rates are trending toward the mid-to-high 80s, and we're on track to be at historical fill levels by the end of the year.\nSo we have confidence in our full year outlook for several reasons. We have improving fill rates. We have new product innovation hitting the shelves by July 1. 2/3 of our marketing spend is concentrated in the second half. We have the incremental impact of pricing, and we have the positive effect of concentration consumption. So in closing, we expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times, and we continue to hunt for new TSR-accretive businesses.\nAnd next up is Rick to give you more details on Q1.\n\nRichard A. Dierker\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Head of Business Operations, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody.\nWe'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.83, flat to prior year. The $0.83 was better than our $0.75 outlook primarily due to continued strong consumer demand, driving higher-than-expected sales as well as better gross margin than expected. Reported revenue was up 4.7% and organic sales were up 2.7%.\nNow let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 2.7% due to positive price/mix offset by lower volume. As anticipated, the discontinuation of WATERPIK Shower Club programs was a drag to organic growth. We also experienced some bumpiness in the month of March and continued into April due to the laundry concentration transition. Good news is we are through that now.\nConsumer International had flat organic sales in Q1 due to broad supply chain disruption and laundry portfolio decisions in Canada. And for our SPD business, organic sales increased 9.2% due to higher price mix and volume. Milk prices have increased throughout Q1 and are projected to level out as 2022 moves forward.\nOur first quarter gross margin was 42.6%, a 190 basis point decrease from a year ago. Let me walk you through the Q2 bridge. Gross margin was impacted by 550 basis points to higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodity inflation, distribution and labor as well as a 10 basis point drag from currency. These costs were offset by a positive 270 basis point impact from price/volume mix, positive 30 basis points from acquisitions and a positive 70 basis points from productivity.\nMoving to marketing. Marketing was up $3 million year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.9%. For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A decreased 50 basis points year-over-year. Other expense, all in, was $14.5 million, a $2.9 million increase resulting from higher average debt outstanding. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 23.2% compared to 24.2% a year ago, a decrease of 100 basis points. We continue to expect the full year rate to be 23%.\nAnd now to cash. For the first 3 months of 2022, cash from operating activities increased 53% to $153 million due to improvements in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. We continue to expect cash from operations to be approximately $920 million for the full year. And as of March 31, cash on hand was $174 million.\nOur full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $200 million as we continue to expand manufacturing capacity focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 5% to 6% and organic sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%. This is sequentially higher from Q1 as we expect an improvement in case fill levels after seeing April trend up into the mid-to-high 80s. We expect Q2 gross margin to contract 200 basis points as we continue to experience higher inflation ahead of the latest round of price increases. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.70 per share, an 8% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. This means our first half earnings will be down approximately 4%, consistent with what our outlook was in January.\nAnd now for the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year reported sales growth to be approximately 5% to 8% and organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 6%. As you read in the release, we announced back an incremental $85 million of cost inflation compared to our original outlook. We're planning on incremental pricing, laundry compaction and productivity to help offset. We continue to expect 10%-plus operating income growth to offset a 320 basis point increase in the effective rate -- effective tax rate. We continue to expect full year EPS in the range of 4% to 8%. However, we now expect to be at the low end of the range.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.",

    "content": "Q4 2021 Church & Dwight Co Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2021 Church & Dwight Co Inc Earnings Call\n\nCHDNYSEJAN 28, 10:00 AM\n\nThis is a machine generated transcript.\n\nDon't show again\n\nPrices are sticking and elasticities are better than our initial forecast and should we move into a recessionary environment, our value brands, which make up 40% of our portfolio are well positioned for a consumer who is looking for deeper value.\n\nIn terms of consumers, who are spending more time at home today, and we think we'll continue to spend increased time at home in the future and will therefore be even more focused on a clean and healthy home, we see great inroads with 3 million incremental households, now using arm hammer and oxiclean each versus pre pandemic levels in 2019.\n\nWe don't see this going backwards and in fact see household penetration continuing to build year over year.\n\nIn the spirit of consumers looking to stay healthy both mentally and physically we see a continuing trend where consumers are looking to vitamins to help out and not just any vitamins, but the gummy form in particular, which is where consumers are migrating to from pills and capsules is up seven points. Since 2019 equally important is that we're well positioned in the category with .\n\nOfferings that match up nicely to all of the consumer need states that are growing including sleep stress mood. Among the others you can see here and all of that translates to an incremental $5 7 million households, buying vital fusion in 2021 than were buying in 2019.\n\nLikewise brand awareness continues to grow and our aided brand awareness is up an incredible 53 points since 2012.\n\nThe fourth trend, we see as not so much emerging but is already established is the belief that self care is not just an occasional splurge, but is increasing part of daily routines.\n\nA few statistics that bear this out included 87% of consumers now claim to actively practice health care, while 70% have established specific self care goals and 59 of practicing self care more in 2021 than in 2020.\n\nA group of some of our most important brands, including Waterpick spin brush Vita fusion Vivek Gal and thorough breath are benefiting from this trend already and stand to benefit even more in the future.\n\nWhat a pick in particular has a lot of runway ahead since the household penetration for waterflood yours is 23% compared to power toothbrushes at approximately 40%.\n\nFinally, whereas eager as our consumers in each of you for a return to normal and we're starting to see a reestablishment of social interaction, which is driving categories like skin and nail care dry shampoo hair growth and depilatory to high single digit or even double digit growth and we see that continuing one interesting statistic.\n\nTo make this one way wheel is that batiste, which is one of our fastest growers in 2021 still has years of runway ahead as U S household penetration for dry shampoo is only four 5% compared to the U K, where the brand was born where household penetration is 8%.\n\nFinally, one category that continues to lag is condoms, but we don't believe sexes over with just yet so we're ready with America's number one condom brand when the category inevitably bounces back.\n\nAnd if that's not enough we still have huge runway ahead on our two most recent acquisitions with regard to Zicam, we haven't had a normal cold and flu season since COVID-19 struck.\n\nAs we emerge from Covid and consumers are increasingly social experts predict there is an inevitable return of the flu and those peak seasons that we see in Q1 and Q4 will provide material growth that we have an experienced since acquiring the brand.\n\nAnd now that we're launching zicam into new gummy form, which I'll talk about more in a bit there's even more reason to believe.\n\nFinally, Sarah breath was a great holiday president when the deal closed on December 24th and when we combine significant new distribution opportunities with our great water Pik dental hygienist detailing force, we see significant room for growth ahead.\n\nSpeaking of thorough breath, just about everyone suffers from morning breath and over $2 5 billion people worldwide are almost 30% of the world's population suffer from some sort of chronic bad breath.\n\nAnd that bad breath starts most of the time and the most throat and tonsils driven by sulfur producing bacteria that lingers there Dr. Katz, who we bought the brand from realize this not only as a dentist himself that as the father of a daughter, who was struggling with chronic bad breath.\n\nSo Dr catch invented this alcohol free mouthwash designed to specifically target sulfur producing bacteria. It was a homerun with his daughter and you can see here that it's been a homerun with consumers everywhere as it has been materially outpacing total mouthwash category growth and the alcohol free category subset every year since launch.\n\nBetter yet there is still huge room to run ahead of US. This slide captures total retail points of distribution for our top competitors and for thorough breadth and what you'll quickly see is that even though third breath is driving category growth as you saw on the last slide we're way behind in total points of distribution with ample room to launch new variance new sizes and expand.\n\nInto new channels ahead.\n\nSo in summary, we participate in great healthy growing categories multiple key trends are our friends and our most recent acquisitions have tremendous room to run all of which give us confidence in our future and we haven't even talked about new products yet.\n\nOkay now, let's move over to new products, where we have a long history of launching new product innovation across our portfolio of power brands in 2022 will be no exception, so let's dive into a sampling of some of our 2022 new products.\n\nThe new Vms consumer who entered during the pandemic is more likely to purchase gummies seeks products with multiple benefits and as a more immune conscious consumer.\n\nAnd as the category continues to shift to gummies vital fusion set out to expand the relevance of gummies in order to continue to win at shelf.\n\nIntroducing vital fusion bilayer gummies. These two in one gummies provides two benefits to flavors and two colors to deliver multiple benefits in a fun and visually appealing way.\n\nThis multi plus platform clearly articulate the product benefits to eshop ability and research has told us that the platform is expected to grow the Vms retail market basket as nearly 30% of respondents said they would take these in addition to their current multi vitamin immune SKU is a multi vitamin plus zinc and vitamin C. The beauty.\n\nSKU is a multi vitamin plus biogen and retinal and we're looking forward to both driving great continued growth.\n\nNow moving over to our specialty hair care franchise, you heard me say earlier that over the past several years theres been a shift in consumer priorities towards self care and during Covid. This trend has been magnified as consumers are spending much more time at home.\n\nOne example of the desire to Pampa and treat one self can be seen in 23% growth in hair treatments and within that segment, 72% growth specifically in hair masks.\n\nHer mask represent an opportunity to care for the health and condition of her however, they typically take around 10 minutes to work and need to be wrenched off in the shower.\n\nIntroducing batiste, leaving her masks, which deliver self care on her terms. These lightweight conditioning formulas are infused with plant derived proteins and vitamin D and allow her to nourish hair and seal in moisture between washes with no rinsing required now.\n\nNow over to health and wellbeing, where two thirds of consumers believe that product sold in the cough cold and flu aisle are more effective than those sold in the Vms aisle.\n\nAnd the Zicam consumer is already buying over $40 worth of competitive immune products sold in the cough cold and flu aisle. So we are losing out on potential sales by not having any immune products in that aisle.\n\nSo now I'm pleased to share that Zicam is launching its first immune supplement gummies.\n\nThe Formula features Zicam zinc and also has 100% daily value of the top three immune ingredients.\n\nThe line includes a regular formula and a nighttime version with melatonin as immune plus sleep is one of the fastest growing sub segments and Vms.\n\nBoth products were also designed to provide a terrific value versus the competition.\n\nNow over to fabric care, where the baby detergent segment is currently a $136 million category and as the second fastest growing segment in liquid laundry detergent, However, arm hammer it doesn't have a product here today to meet mom's needs, where we know she is looking for a hard working product at a reasonable price. So she doesn't have to compromise.\n\nOn what's best for her baby.\n\nIntroducing our first arm Hammer baby launch detergent, which is designed to help families do what's best for their babies with zero compromises.\n\nSpecialty created with our arm hammer babies in mind.\n\nIts gentle enough for baby skin.\n\nTested by Pediatricians and offers a hypo allergenic formula that has zero preservatives, no phosphates and no dies and it's even EPA certified as a safer choice.\n\nWe're very excited about this launch because of baby liquid laundry detergent also helps us down age you arm Hammer brand, increasing the lifetime value of each consumer let's take a look at some videos that bring this new offer from arm hammer to life.\n\nSleeper crib.\n\nUsually crib, sometimes cause sleep.\n\nNope Snake Wonder if there's anything new arm Hammer, David occasion tough on baby things gentle on skin.\n\nOkay.\n\nComfort or try it out.\n\nMost of the crowd out but there is some comfort.\n\nSnake Wonder if there's anything new arm hammer, they've indicated cap on baby gentle on skin.\n\nOkay.\n\nAttachment or free range parenting three range.\n\nMaybe a hybrid attachment snake wonder if there's anything new arm Hammer detergent, Katherine maybe things stand alone scale.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in closing these are just a few highlights from another great year of innovation from Church Dwight.\n\nOkay, now, let's switch gears and move over to the steps, we're taking on our path to a more sustainable future.\n\nStarting with the reality that climate is more relevant than ever, especially for our younger consumers.\n\nGen Z in particular is two times more likely than baby boomers to say they've been personally affected by climate change.\n\nAnd the expectations for businesses and brands are very high consumers expect companies to take care of the planet and make progress and societal issues at the same time.\n\nAs a company our recent actions such as offsetting 100% of our global electricity demand by moving to Green energy and in partnering with Arbor Day Foundation to plant millions of trees in the Mississippi River Valley have helped set the stage for our next move.\n\nWhich is formalizing our climate strategy by submitting our application to the science based targets initiative, we recognize the importance of taking a science based approach to the environment and ensuring that the targets, we set and corresponding actions. We take are aligned to industry standards and best practices, including in our application to is a commitment to .\n\nSlow the warming of the planet incur.\n\nIncrease the use of renewables and report on our progress through our annual sustainability report.\n\nSo you can see that we're taking this problem seriously at a corporate level, but our consumers who have always been proud problem solvers Wanna get involved as well and our goal is to engage them through the power of our most iconic brand arm hammer.\n\nWhich is why today, we're pleased to announce we're kicking off a new campaign, starting with arm Hammer baking soda to show consumers, we're taking responsibility for our impact on the environment brand by brand to get started we measured our carbon footprint on baking soda and are working to reduce it to zero initially through verified carbon offsets.\n\nAllow me to share a video with you that illustrates how we plan to bring this to life.\n\nIn 2022, we're taking a big step.\n\nToward reducing our future impact on the environment.\n\nYes, our iconic little box that rests on the back of your fridge.\n\nAs moving forward to do our part on climate change.\n\nWe've measured our bacon set a carbon emission reducing them to zero for verified carbon offset.\n\nAll of US who work on the arm Hammer brand are proud to do our part.\n\nSo we can all keep enjoying the beauty of our collective home for generations to come.\n\nAnd we plan to invite consumers to join us and help US go further.\n\nBecause this journey.\n\nJust getting started.\n\n[music].\n\nArm hammer.\n\nOur powers senior.\n\nThroughout this journey our goals are to drive awareness engage consumers and inspire action will have more news to share in the space around how we can work in partnership with our consumers to multiply our efforts and invite you to follow our journey as we build new strengths here and do our part to protect the environment.\n\nOkay now over to my friend, Mike read to talk about our growing international business. Thanks, Barry and good morning, everyone over the next few minutes I'd like to run it through the international consumer highlights followed by our specialty products story.\n\nFor the International Division, our Evergreen model target is 6% and organic sales growth.\n\n2021, we posted organic growth of 5%.\n\nSlightly below our evergreen model of 6%, but lapping 8.6% growth in 2020.\n\nAnd while we are below our evergreen model target 2021 is a strong delivery in the face of widespread global supply disruptions impacts.\n\nImpacts from Covid, 19, and weather related events.\n\nQ4 finished at four 7% growth combining our two international segments.\n\nOur subsidiary markets, which are fully stocked church Dwight teams, Canada, Mexico, The U K, France, Germany, and Australia, and secondly, our global markets group that covers more than 130 markets represented by over 400 distributor partners around the globe with our subsidiary .\n\nsegments posted positive growth in 2021.\n\nAnd continue to have strong consumer demand and improving market share positions in key categories. The.\n\nThe result is rebuilt and international consumer business that is now in excess of $900 million in sales and approaching scale in several markets.\n\nLet's take a closer look .\n\nnow represents our largest segment at 35% of total international net sales has doubled in size over the past five years.\n\nFollowed by Canada, a 28% Europe , 22 in Australia, and Mexico at 8% and 7%.\n\nAcross all our segments, we continue to gain distribution.\n\nIntroduce new brands and innovation enter new channels and widened our geographic reach to drive growth.\n\nFrom a gross standpoint, our subsidiary markets grew 3% 2021.\n\nIn Gmg grew almost 11%.\n\nImportant to note international mix is heavily weighted towards personal care and OTC categories versus household many of which have faced category setbacks due to COVID-19.\n\nSo what's driving our international growth.\n\nWe have a portfolio of brands that consumers love.\n\nAnd that's not limited to the U S market and we are early days in many of the world's largest economies. We continue to expand our U S power brands to global power brands brands like arm Hammer Oxiclean and Trojan continue to gain momentum all of which have long international runways in our global markets.\n\nThis includes selectively leveraging innovation sourced out of our G NPI organization and launching locally relevant new products under our global brands.\n\nWe continue to widen our personal care and OTC portfolio presence in emerging markets like China Southeast Asia.\n\nIt'll east and Latin America, with particular focus on brands like , and you saw rebel and Cerro Moro.\n\nOur portfolio has proven over and over it can travel a success.\n\nWe continue to drive household penetration.\n\nMore recent acquisitions like water Pik and flawless.\n\nAcquisition has been a key growth driver for international Sirba offers our latest installed.\n\nLet's turn now to some of the key investments in capabilities, we're focused on.\n\nFirst we continue to widen our support of a booming e-commerce business in China with local resources and expertise to partner closely with our valued distributors.\n\nAs one example in 2022, we're investing behind the direct sell model in China, which will enable us to sell new brands directly to consumers online.\n\nE Commerce portals.\n\nSecond we continue to evolve our manufacturing footprint strategy to help service the needs of our fast growing international business, particularly in Asia.\n\nThis includes select local manufacturing and the use of co Packers, where scale warrants and lower cost can be achieved.\n\nWe've added people resources on the ground and our newest Gmg office in Mumbai, India to support our local distributors and growth throughout the region.\n\nWe continue to build e-commerce , and digital marketing capability across the globe to connect better with our consumers and drive consumption e-commerce platforms.\n\nAnd we continue to approach pricing with discipline importantly, in an inflationary environment and we're adding dedicated resources and revenue growth management to support this capability moving forward.\n\nWhile this isn't an exhaustive list. It provides some examples of the investments, we're making internationally to continue to drive profitable growth for years to come.\n\nAs we continue to build scale leverage pricing and improved brand mix towards personal care and OTC. We continued to deliver on our evergreen target to expand operating margin in the international division by at least 50 basis points per year.\n\nWe did better than expected in 2020, where we grew 120 basis points. In 2021 is more of the same growing operating margin another 120 basis points.\n\nIn closing on international we've had a stellar track record of growth since 2014.\n\nAnd more than $900 million in net sales. We are pacing ahead of the long term evergreen model targets.\n\nBy leveraging our portfolio of brands that consumers love, including our newly acquired acquisitions and innovation continuing.\n\nContinuing to expand our global market footprint and by investing in key capabilities International remains committed to delivering our evergreen target of 6% organic sales growth and expanding operating margin by 50 basis points.\n\nOkay, let's switch gears to our animal productivity story.\n\nOur specialty products division from an evergreen model perspective aims to deliver 5% organic sales growth.\n\nOur specialty products Division is now more than $330 million in sales and posted strong growth above plan in 2021 at 12%.\n\n70% of the business is animal productivity, while the remaining 30% is supported by specialty chemical sales.\n\nAs you can see animal productivity is split into two main segments dairy and nondairy.\n\nWe produced three types of products prebiotics, probiotics and nutritional supplements.\n\nThis is important as today's consumer continues to move away from foods produced with antibiotics and our portfolio is geared directly to support this growing trend.\n\nThe dairy business is a cyclical market and represents the biggest part of the animal productivity business. Typically every few years, we see an up year as evidenced by 2011 2014 and again in 2017.\n\nDue to COVID-19, we did experience a delay in the up cycle 2020, and we did anticipate a strong recovery in 2021.\n\nBut with healthy milk prices forecast had been strong demand for dairy products. We do expect back to back years of organic growth in 2020 to breaking the animal productivity cycle.\n\nBack in 2015, non dairy sales were largely nonexistent today nondairy sales represent approximately 26% and has balanced out our portfolio.\n\nWe expect our non dairy sales to grow double digits in 2022.\n\nSimilarly, we're adding resources and growing our animal nutrition business globally in 2021, our international business has grown to represent 16% of total sales.\n\noffering further balance in revenue growth streams in our portfolio.\n\nIn summary, specialty products has delivered an impressive 12% growth in 2021.\n\nWe're backed by a trusted brand and arm hammer.\n\nWe're aligned to growing consumer trends towards prebiotics and probiotics, we continue to widen our species footprint to include cattle swine and poultry and we're adding resources to grow our international business.\n\nThanks for listening now over to respond to talk about supply chain.\n\nI am going to take a few moments to talk about our efforts to secure the performance of our supply chain.\n\nLike many manufacturers, we have stepped up our focus on resiliency over the last two years, here's how we articulate our strategy.\n\nAnd Dwight has a short resilient and tariff proved supply chain, serving western and APAC market with local manufacturing.\n\nWe have implemented several initiatives to reduce the length of our supply chain over the last two years one.\n\nOne example is how we are supplying our growing business in the APAC region in 2020 zero percent of our business sold in APAC was manufactured there by the end of next year, 40% will be sourced from within the region.\n\nCloser to home, we have added two to three pls to our distribution network, which has enabled us to position buffer inventory closer to our customers' Dcs in the southeast and south central regions.\n\nIn order to reduce tariffs and our overall dependency on China. We have started to move water Pik manufacturing to other southeast Asia locations by the end of 2023, 50% of our volume will be produced ex China.\n\nWe do a good job of managing a complex base of suppliers and co Packers in order to add additional sourcing options. We have increased our co manufacturing base by 19% since the start of the pandemic and our supplier base by 22%.\n\nWe now have many more options when we face upstream disruptions.\n\nOf course in addition to our large base of contract manufacturers. We are impressive in house manufacturing capabilities with an ability to produce a wider array of products in multiple formats across our 15 plants we.\n\nWe've done a lot of work over the last few years to increase throughput out of our plants and to be the best employer in the areas, where we operate so that we can retain and attract talented employees.\n\nAnd we are making significant capacity investment in house in order to stay ahead of our growing categories were either completed or have active capacity projects underway for liquid laundry unit dose laundry trigger products Vms and cat litter.\n\nWe have a dedicated and talented supply chain team division that they March too is to maintain operational excellence, while creating the supply chain of the future.\n\nOur talented team has done a great job of dealing with the many urgent issues that depend demick is putting in front of them while building more resiliency for the future.\n\nAnd now back to Matt.\n\nThanks, Rick let's spend a few minutes on how we run the company.\n\nWe have five operating principles.\n\nNumber one we leverage our brands number two we are a friend of the environment.\n\nThree we have highly productive people.\n\nAnd before we strive to be asset light and finally number five we leverage acquisitions.\n\nIf you do the first four well you will have good shareholder returns. If you can add solid acquisitions, you can generate great returns.\n\nNumber one we are fortunate to have brands that consumers love and we have dozens of brands around the world.\n\nNumber two we have a long history of being a friend of the environment you can see some of the milestones on this slide we are very proud of our heritage and you heard Barry take us through our most recent commitment to science based targets.\n\nIn addition to our goal of being carbon neutral by 2025 through science based targets, we have a goal of reducing our water usage by 10% annually and maintaining a solid waste recycling rate of 75% and we have received plenty of recognition for our ESG efforts a few of them are displayed here.\n\nThree we have the most productive people in the CPG space, we have approximately 5000 employees with $1 million in sales per employee.\n\nWe believe this is an underappreciated performance measure.\n\nOur people are motivated by a simple compensation structure with four metrics sales gross margin EPS and cash from operations. Our long term incentives are stock options. So we are aligned with shareholders to drive our valuation.\n\nWe have a focus on gross margin. This is an uncommon incentive compensation metric, while we missed our gross margin target in 2021 that hasnt shaken our confidence.\n\nWe're still focused on the four drivers of gross margin expansion.\n\nGood to great, which is our continuous improvement program supply chain optimization, new products and acquisition synergies number four is leverage assets. We are an asset light company historically capex averages about 2% of sales that will be higher in 2022, and 2023 as we expand our capacity.\n\nIn our growing businesses, namely vitamins laundry and litter.\n\nNumber five is leverage acquisitions.\n\nAs I said earlier, we have a long history of growth through acquisitions, we have clear acquisition criteria and the discipline to apply that criteria, which is to buy number one or number two brands they need to grow at or above our evergreen model and have gross margins in excess of corporate gross margins.\n\nWe are attracted to businesses that are asset light.\n\nOftentimes, we can leverage our scale to generate synergies and finally, they need to have a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nOur long term view is this we have 14 power brands today 20 tomorrow.\n\nNext up is Rick to take us through the financials.\n\nThank you, Matt and good morning, everybody, we have some great results to share across the board. We finished 2021 better than expected led by strong consumer demand for our products and we are entering 2022 with momentum.\n\nToday, I will walk through four areas first the evergreen model.\n\nOn 2021 results third our 2022 outlook and then finally I'll wrap up with capital allocation.\n\nHere's our evergreen business model, we've had this for a very long time and our long term investors know this 3% organic sales growth, 8% EPS growth.\n\nAnd the details would be plus 3% organic sales growth 25 basis points of gross margin expansion marketing is typically flat SG&A leverage and we get 50 basis points of operating margin expansion, which leads to 8% EPS growth, we have a lot of different levers to pull in order to get 3% and 8%.\n\nSo for 2021, we ended the year in the quarter with four 3% organic sales growth domestic was three and a half international was a little bit better than four and a half and SPD was 12% gross margin declined by 50 basis points, but this was better than we expected marketing change was down 90 basis points at 14, 7% a lot higher than 13%.\n\nOur outlook at this is really because we had a great tax benefit that we were able to spend back in marketing SG&A was plus 50 basis points and EPS was 64.\n\nbetter than our and outlook our full year 2021, we ended the year with four 3% organic sales growth three five for domestic five for international and 12 for SPD gross margin was down 150 basis points as we faced 9% of Cogs inflation year over year or $250 million.\n\nMarketing was down 100 basis points to 11, 1% and adjusted SG&A was down 50 basis points ought to get adjusted EPS at 7% or $3 per share cash from operations was $994 million and free cash flow conversion was 116% that's.\n\nFree cash flow divided by net income how much net income we turned into cash flow gross margin contracted in 2021 and in Q4, we were down 50 basis points, but price volume mix was plus $2 90.\n\nWhich was partially offsetting the inflation the massive headwind of inflation commodities distribution labor.\n\nProductivity programs added 110 basis points and then the acquisition was plus 30 basis points. So that's how we get to minus 50 as you can see when you compare Q4 to 2021 full year you can see the gap between price volume mix and inflation narrowing and we expect that to continue in 2022.\n\nNow turning to the outlook, 5% to 8% reported sales growth, 3% to 6% organic sales growth operating profit margin of plus $60, plus 70 basis points and.\n\nAnd adjusted EPS growth of 48%.\n\nAnd here's the detail the three 6% organic sales growth is made up of domestic at 3% to 6% international and 5% to 7% and SPD at 5%. All these divisions are at or above the evergreen model.\n\nOrganic sales growth.\n\nMost margins contracts marketing the dollars are higher.\n\nWe leverage SG&A.\n\nAnd that's how we get to 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion.\n\nThe effective tax rate is higher year over year by 320 basis points or 23%.\n\nThis is a huge headwind to face, but our profit is actually going to be up 10% plus as a result, just showing and demonstrating the strength of our business adjusts.\n\nAdjusted EPS growth is 48% and cash from operations is about $920 million as we build back safety stocks on inventory.\n\nHere's organic sales over the 10 year horizon.\n\nOur evergreen model is 3% or 10 year average is closer to four 1% and our 2022 outlook is 3% to 6%.\n\nAnd we're focused on gross margin and we have been for a long time very few companies have an incentive targets, we believe it drives.\n\nNot only cash earnings, but cash flow as well.\n\nIn 2021, we had a step down largely due to inflation, we had a 9% increase in Cogs in 2022, we expect a 5% to 6% increase in Cogs all of the pricing work that we're doing is offsetting that but we're going to be continuing to chase that ball downhill. So we're committed to offset dollar for dollar but margin will be down in 2022.\n\nThere is a cadence to the margin in the first half we expect to be down in the second half we expect it to be up largely because of the timing of inflation in 2021.\n\nSpecifically in Q1, we expect margin to decline by 250 basis points.\n\nOur marketing spend we have a long track record of spending behind our brands in 2021, we had 11, 1% in 2022, we're going to have higher dollars in 2021 the percent will be lower as it is impacted by the topline pricing actions that we've taken SG&A leverage as a hallmark of , we have the highest revenue per employee in the industry. We expect.\n\nIn 2022 to again leverage SG&A and we have a long track record of great EPS growth of high single digit low double digit EPS growth for a long long time and in 2022, we expect 4% to 8% EPS growth $3 14 to $3 26.\n\nThe cadence for EPS growth is similar to gross margin down in the first half, but up in the second half we expect stronger volumes in the back half as our supply chain improves and we have normalized promotional levels.\n\nTurning to cash flow. This is probably my favorite slide 10 years of history here, 122% average free cash flow conversion in 2021, 116%.\n\nAnd how do we do that we do it through and tight control of working capital. We've moved our cash conversion cycle from 52 days at the end of the 30 and the 20th announced 15 days in 2021 and 2022, we expect that to go up a little bit as we build back inventory and safety stock. We have a strong balance sheet. We ended 2021 with one nine times debt to EBITDA.\n\nWe expect to end 2022, with one six times debt to EBITDA.\n\nThat's despite doing our fourth largest acquisition recently their breath. This has been our business model for a long period of time, we buy a business, we lever up and we paid down.\n\nAnd we have significant financial capacity, we could do a $3 8 billion deal and maintain our credit rating.\n\nAnd moving to capital allocation here. The prioritize uses of cash flow first faraway tsi accretive M&A number two capex for organic growth in .\n\nNumber three new product development number for debt reduction and number five returning cash to shareholders through dividends or buyback.\n\nWe're not a capital intensive company, our evergreen model is around 2% of sales for Capex and for many years, we run below that but you can see back in 2009, we have to add capacity, we do and it will spike in in 2022 and 2023, it's no different we're going to bump up as we add capacity for laundry litter and vitamins.\n\nAnd then finally, we have a 4% dividend increase in 2022. This is a 121 consecutive years of dividends.\n\nAnd then Q3 and Q4, we also spent $500 million on share buybacks. So we always like to return cash to shareholders.\n\nThis ends the formal presentation and now I will turn it over to Matt and myself and the rest of the leadership team for Q&A.\n\nThank you and ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time simply press star one for your questions.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAnd that is star one.\n\nI have a question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\n\nHi, good morning, everyone.\n\nGood morning.\n\nJust a question on.\n\nPricing.\n\nRelative to the volumes.\n\nKind of a wide range on organic sales.\n\nAs you get through the year or are you embedding the potential that elasticity is starting to become a bigger factor as you get through the year, perhaps the consumer is less able to handle the additional pricing.\n\nAnd then.\n\nIn the near term just just on Q1 clearly.\n\nThe organic sales outlook.\n\nThe pricing and conscious that some is coming later in the quarter still.\n\nStill seems relatively low to the momentum that you've been seeing cognizant of some of the supply chain headwinds that otherwise.\n\nCan you just frame.\n\nThe potential flex in that Q1 topline outlook as well thank you.\n\nYes, sure I'll take the quarter and some of those answers are going to be explained and when you're talking about the full year as well so.\n\nOn Q1, our outlook is 1%, 2%, Chris and it's largely.\n\nTwo reasons, but let me talk about price volume mix first for the year. So if you take our midpoint of our outlook for organic growth. It's about four 5% right, 3% to 6% mid 0.4, and a half we would say that price mix was about five 5% and then we have a drag of volumes of about 1% all.\n\nThat 1% in Q4, and Q1 now so thats, 4% and the rationale is three things. One is volume elasticity is right. All the price increases that were effective in 2021, we're really in the second half of the year.\n\nNumber two we discontinued some club programs for water Pik and then as we always do.\n\nWe rationalized low margin volume for laundry. So those are the three reasons why we're at 1% to 2% in the quarter.\n\nAnd that's also why price volume mix actually improves throughout the year organic improves throughout the year and gross margin also improved throughout the year.\n\nChris does that answer your question.\n\nOh, yes, yes.\n\nThanks, so much.\n\nAnd then just following up.\n\nOn.\n\nSpending levels for this year.\n\nMarketing.\n\nBack to the lower end.\n\nThe historical range.\n\nCan you just talk about how you view that as a flex item in the outlook through the year we stayed.\n\ncommitted.\n\nTo that level of spending should volume elasticity to become more of a dynamic would you would you look to spend more behind say, bringing back promotional levels just the sorts of actions.\n\nYou'd look to it should.\n\nBecome more of a factor as we get through the year.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we would do Chris.\n\nHonestly, we have a wide range for both reported and organic so as our supply chain issues abate and we'll get some more some more shipments out the door kind of opportunity to spend more on marketing and the expectation is anyway for 'twenty two versus 21 that our marketing dollars are going.\n\nB up year over year.\n\nIf you look at the percentage.\n\nCould be lower than 'twenty, one but.\n\nKeep in mind, you get big price increases that are driving the top line. So the relationship is a little bit different.\n\nPercentage of sales, but our dollar spend is up in 'twenty two versus 21.\n\nGood okay. Thanks, so much.\n\nAlright, Thanks, Chris.\n\nOur next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thank you and good morning, everybody.\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the organic sales outlook because so.\n\nPerhaps for the full year the wireless range, we've seen in a while.\n\nObviously starting.\n\nAt a relatively low point in Q1, but I mean it.\n\nYour comps are only about 120 basis points of a range from low to high and so so that's a really substantial step up as the year progresses and you just noted that every year, you're rationalizing low margin sales so that should be in the comprehensive globally as well so just a little bit more granularity with respect to your views as you implement.\n\nThe price increases.\n\nAnd and and what seems like a fairly favorable view on the volume elasticity as the year progresses.\n\nYes.\n\nYou're right about our elasticity as rls facilities are actually much better than we had expected.\n\nIt took a liquid laundry for example.\n\n20 to 30 range and we expected it to be.\n\nWorse actually and that will actually probably improve going forward simply because we know that.\n\nBoth Procter and Henkel are now raising prices or is the range growth.\n\nSo kind of a wide range, we haven't had to.\n\nRange like that in the past, but it's so with good reason fill levels have been low for not just the past 12 months, but it's almost the past 18 months and we've had difficulty raising them. So the extent that our labor issues abate and not only in house, but also ounce outhouse.\n\nSuppliers and co Packers are also struggling with labor.\n\nWe get more and more.\n\nProduct to ship, we're going to have much higher top line now look we also know we have a.\n\nHi.\n\nHigh single digit price increase.\n\nSo we think well if you've got a high single thing of price increase you would think that youre going to have a pretty pretty robust reported topline and organic top line, which we will if we can if we can ship the product, but thats, who we had to leave ourselves some room.\n\nBecause we are anticipating things getting better, but hasnt happened yet, yes, the only thing I would add to that Olivia It's Rick is.\n\n2021 was the most volatile year.\n\nIn many many years and so we're used to given tight ranges, but 2022, we expect to be very volatile as well and so like a lot of companies where it is can sure we have a range of.\n\nPossibilities for the revenue line and the earnings line.\n\nGot it thanks.\n\nOn the margin guide looking for 60 70 basis points in operating margin. Despite gross margin declined on marketing.\n\nIncreasing perhaps it looks like.\n\nIn dollar terms, but maybe not in terms of.\n\nMargin on a year over year basis. So.\n\nThat would imply pretty nice improvement on G&A. So can you talk about some of the key levers there.\n\nImproved G&A and then just one last question on vitamins. If you could just talk about the competitive dynamics, given you've obviously continuing to add.\n\nInnovative new products, you've got solid demand for the category, but just wondering when you think of competition. Thanks. So much appreciate it.\n\nOkay, Let's talk about vitamins first the demand is really high for vitamins right now and the category was up 8% for the full year and our share position is very strong.\n\nYou heard from Barry earlier household penetration is up.\n\nis sticking and we have of course two of them. One is the wellness trend and the other one is the transition from pills and capsules.\n\nGummies.\n\nPart of our success in the last few years, and we think continuing into the future is going to be our new product launches they've done really well.\n\nThis past year.\n\nAs far as private label it does come up from time to time in private label share of Gummies is declined in four consecutive quarters went from 25%.\n\nFour quarters ago down 21%, the most recent quarter and looking ahead to.\n\nThe 22, we have a nice lineup of new products.\n\nWe can we can we can sell everything we make and we have a couple of co Packers theyre going to be coming online mid year, so that should give us some relief.\n\nAnd then in terms of the operating expansion, where thats coming from you are right. Olivia we said that gross margin is going to be down marketing as a percent of sales will be down dollars will be up and that means we're going to also leverage SG&A. We've said for many years. When you look at our evergreen model for SG&A, we're trying to get 25 basis points from that.\n\nAnd we've done the math and we said hey, if we can.\n\nGrow our SG&A dollars at half the rate of sales and that evergreen model right at 3% of sales.\n\nThen it's about 15 basis points and so our revenues growing anywhere between five and 8% next year. So we're going to be able to leverage that because we're still having the same type of dollar increase on SG&A. So we expect that just to I'm not going to point to any specific details, but we will have more leverage than normal because our topline is growing faster.\n\nUnderstood. Thanks best of luck.\n\nThanks, Brian .\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nYeah, Hey, good morning, guys.\n\nCan you elaborate on the improvement in the North American supply and fill rates that youre anticipating just in terms of the.\n\nBut kind of your latest base case timing and kind of just do we improve all the way back to normal by the end of the year or second half or is it.\n\nStill expecting tightness throughout 'twenty two.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Steve we think it's going to be sequential improvement throughout the year.\n\nWe normally have fill rates around 90, 899% who are low right now so we hope to be exiting the year in the mid Ninety's, but we have respond on the phone who is our head of supply chain.\n\nIt's going to make it happen anything to add Rick.\n\nYes, Thanks, Matt.\n\nSo we're doing a lot where as you saw from the presentation, we're investing an incremental capacity.\n\nThose projects take time of course, so where we.\n\nWhere we need to we are increasing our third party manufacturing to supplement supply to hold this over until the capacity projects come on stream.\n\nBut as Matt said, we will progress up through the mid Ninety's by the by the end of the year.\n\n.\n\nGave us a step back with high with high absenteeism.\n\nWe're already starting to see absenteeism improve in our plants and now we're focusing on upstream supply of materials.\n\nOkay great.\n\nTwo quick questions follow ups on pricing if I could just the first one is.\n\nFor the pricing I guess to what degree is there pricing you've announced that hasn't yet hit the market and what's the cadence of that incremental pricing flowing through number one and then just on some of the new products specifically the zicam BNS products in the baby arm Hammer detergent, how are those going to be priced relative to the rest of your .\n\nOn laundry portfolios respectively.\n\nYes, I'll take the.\n\nThe incremental pricing.\n\nSo we did announced a few months ago that we're going to have incremental pricing.\n\nExtra 30% to now, we're 80% plus and Thats going to hit in late February .\n\nWe haven't and we Wouldnt, we Wouldnt front run any other conversations on pricing on this call, but we will report back and let you know when there is incremental pricing above that 80%.\n\nAnd the other question was pricing for for the baby product.\n\nYes, Sam Vms and baby you just relative to the rest of those portfolios.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe paul or very light.\n\nComment.\n\nYes.\n\nBob.\n\nThis is Paul I think that probably the easiest way to answer all three of them. One is there going to be line price within the set right. The part of these launches as we want to be complementary to the center incremental purchases, but part of the family brand. So, particularly you can imagine one zicam in Vms and others, maybe obviously is a different proposition but still.\n\nIncrement incremental purchase in that.\n\nMom is looking for a separate product for the baby loads, but I would say on that one I don't want to be too prescriptive or detailed on this call, but I would say, we're well priced competitively in the category would be how I'd answer that one in particular.\n\nOkay. Thank you very much I appreciate it.\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks, good morning, everyone.\n\nQuestion.\n\nMatt and Rick on the guidance and then.\n\nRelated question for Barry if I could squeeze in a second one the first one on the long term guidance of 3% sort of in the spirit of the analyst day and sort of more longer term oriented.\n\nThe company has exceeded it naturally for a number of years youre guiding above that for this upcoming year is about four 5% you have a slide up which rightly points out the highest category grow along sort of setting aside which you hope to do from a market share perspective, you talked a lot about some of the stickiness of consumer behavior around health and wellness, where I think most people on this call.\n\nThe degree.\n\nAnd then I can.\n\nExpect for your own internal planning around capacity at around your cost structure I suspect that's predicated on the growth rate over the next three to five years ahead of that 3%. So that's all a big sort of wind up here, if you considered revisiting that guidance for investors.\n\nYes.\n\nKevin.\n\nCould have predicted this question was coming I think you are consistent.\n\nThat question the annually.\n\nGot it.\n\nHey, Matt.\n\nI thought maybe we'd duck. It this year because we have this range of three to six and $4 in the middle I think Kevin is going to be happy with that.\n\nYou're asking about is it should we change our evergreen model correct.\n\nIf I.\n\nCut you off even consider changing where it's less.\n\nLess emphasis on the 50 basis points of margin improvement, which is tough to do year in year out.\n\nIn the absence of favorable mix from doing deals so heavier on the topline and even something 25 to 50 on operating margin. So sorry for cutting you off but go ahead.\n\nNo no no.\n\nI understand the math, but the way the way we've used the evergreen model as we do it for a long range planning and yes, we don't ever want to leave ourselves short from a capacity standpoint, so just because we have a 3% evergreen model doesn't mean that we would.\n\nPut any governors are caps on our on capacity expansion. So last one wanted to do is to be .\n\n.\n\nThe sold out so.\n\nI would remind you as well that the evergreen model is also something that is very important to financial literacy within the company because it's something we talk about all the time.\n\nIt's familiar to all of our employees. So yes, there is some merit.\n\nYour argument to say, we're going to grow at a 4% organic level.\n\nIt takes some of the air out of the balloon when it comes to gross margin, but there's still we will still arrive at the 8% EPS number on the bottom so yes.\n\nIt is.\n\nIt's not it's not something we don't think about Kevin is that don't think once a year. When you asked this question. So let me.\n\nI'll give it some thought.\n\nYeah.\n\nStay tuned it's something we do.\n\nWe've been looking at.\n\nUnderstood Fair and then if I could just squeeze in one more just for Barry.\n\nEarly observations since moving into the CMO overall biggest areas of opportunity that you see sort of a fresh set of eyes fresh perspective of the portfolio and then maybe areas that perhaps need a little bit more of your attention.\n\nOver the next 12 months.\n\nSure. Thanks, Kevin I think.\n\n90 days in or so I think I have been telling the international story for so long before about how much opportunity is there I think I see.\n\nAmple opportunity here in the U S. As well there are so many of those trends that I took you through earlier in the presentation that are so well suited to our brands and the categories that we're in so.\n\nBeing up on the U S guys Madison International for Awhile, but I would say equally excited here and whether it's around vitamins or whether it's about around laundry as supply comes back ample opportunity everywhere and then in terms of challenges are things I'm looking at.\n\nAs we spend more in media with trick and Matt mentioned up in absolute dollars next year whats the best spend of that digital gets really really attractive because of its perceived perfect measure ability, but I think linear is still has a role in your television still has a role for its broad reach so really working on that right mix of linear versus digital.\n\nAnd kind of upper funnel brand building versus lower funnel by now by here kind of stuff. So those are those early thoughts great opportunity and want to get the marketing mix right as its a large line item in our P&L.\n\nGot it makes sense. Thank you very much for the color. Good luck everyone sure. Thanks, Thanks, Kevin.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from will with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. So the first area I wanted to touch on International I was just curious what you guys are seeing lately in the international and whether Youre seeing any impact from Lockdowns and restrictions.\n\nYes, no we have.\n\nThis is two to.\n\nMike Reed in the second but Youre, absolutely right that we've had intermittent alive lockdowns and a lot of markets Internationalists also hampered by.\n\nTransportation issues in containers and getting product and if you look at our guide for next year, when we said, 5% to 7% and you know our evergreen number six so we are expecting to be in the sweet spot, but maybe Mike you could give a little bit of color on what we've been experiencing in international markets.\n\nYes, Thanks, Matt.\n\nThanks for your question for the question yes.\n\nWe're having similar challenges as Matt said from a supply chain perspective, but what I'd point to is we have really healthy consumer demand for our portfolio across the board.\n\nWe are seeing really strong growth across all of our subsidiary divisions, but also within kind of how we break out our global markets group into five regions. So we are seeing really positive growth in demand is really just about fulfilling it.",
    "content2": "So I'd point to our ability to access our portfolio in multiple markets is still really strong.\n\nA matter of kind of keeping up with demand, but the orders are definitely there.\n\nYes.\n\nRick.\n\nI just wanted to add one line to that.\n\nWe had four 7% organic growth in Q4 for international So somebody might say well that's a little below your evergreen model for international but I would tell you. If you look back in Q4 of 2020, we grew 14, 9%. So on the two year stack that 19, 5% growth rate is the strongest quarter actually.\n\nAnd the whole year.\n\nGreat and then maybe just two quick financial questions. So first on the Capex side any any any specific guidance you can give on Capex I think last time, you guys said, you expect to exceed $200 million and our gross margins is there any additional color you can provide just in terms of the drivers for the year.\n\nYes on the Capex side, we have a slide in the analyst deck, and we actually put out a number.\n\nI think it was $2 12 off top my head, but it was 200 million plus.\n\nFor 2022, and it was $300 million it was $2 16 in 2022 and plus.\n\nPlus 300 million in 2023 is what we're putting out there right now just for those.\n\nCapacity projects like laundry litter and vitamins.\n\nIn terms of gross margin.\n\nI think the biggest thing on gross margin and we've talked about how it's going to improve throughout the year is really just the.\n\nWhen you take when you take price.\n\nWell, let's talk about inflation, we have $150 million of inflation right. So the simple math is when you do that youre down like 300 basis points on margin.\n\nBut when you take price, even if you take price of 150 million to offset it you only get a margin benefit of about 160 or 170 basis points because it impacts.\n\nThe top line and impacts Cogs, So I think.\n\nAs I said before our gross margin improved throughout the quarter and we will exit the year with positive gross margin.\n\nIn Q4.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay. Thanks for your question.\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with Jpmorgan. Your line is open.\n\nThank you good morning, everybody.\n\nJust one quick too fine.\n\nObviously, the M&A priority in your cash allocation.\n\nWhere are the areas.\n\nThank you and there is still white space for years to cycle in organic growth and then.\n\nAnd then on the fine print on this I appreciate giving the.\n\nMargin rates.\n\nI believe you still have the benefit in the fourth quarter Youll have I believe 30 basis points for the full year 20 basis points benefit from acquisition like that is an additional call. It trying.\n\nAny dates for the year will kind of go back to attention. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Andrea I'll do some of the margin discussion in the Netherlands to the M&A question.\n\nI wasn't really given a margin bridge I was just giving an example on on on how price it.\n\nIt doesn't have the same margin impact as inflation would I wasn't really guiding to specific numbers, there, but we're not going to get into the margin details because there's just more volatile than normal and so the guidance is that we are.\n\nThat we're going to decline on gross margin for 2022.\n\nYeah, and as far as acquisitions go we've had this question from time to time, but okay. What categories are we interested in and if you asked us that two years ago.\n\nI think we probably would not have come up with going into the color shortening or going into mouthwash.\n\nSo what we do because we have a competency in making so many different types of products in our manufacturing facilities. So we can put liquid in a bottle we can make aerosols we can put.\n\nPowder in a box.\n\nGels et cetera, Theres, a lots of things that we know how to make and can manage so consequently, we throw a very wide net when we're looking at potential acquisitions and you know we have a well worn list of acquisitions that we went through in our pitch. This morning in the final criteria, which that those without a lot of categories, but we wouldn't.\n\nWe wouldn't be able to call out hey, here's here's a couple of categories. We're looking for for for acquisitions, Andrea just the process doesn't work that way.\n\nGreat and a quick question on them.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. So I was kind of hoping to drill down or get back to that slide that showed category growth that Kevin alluded to in his question earlier I think you look back in 2017 in 2019, it was kind of hovering around that 4% range, obviously accelerated a lot in 'twenty, two and I think it showed up 6% in 'twenty one so I'm just curious.\n\nBut how do you see category growth unfolding as you move ahead, I know theres a lot of puts and takes some categories seem to be getting better or some is probably getting worse, but like what is the right category growth rate longer term as we move further away from this COVID-19 environment.\n\nYeah, well I'm Barry can take a swing at that but I'll, just say historically, if you're referring to that particular slide generally are the categories that we're in I. Remember every company is different so the organic growth rates are a function of what categories. You are and so we're different than a lot of other companies I'm sure that you you follow but historically are.\n\nAverage if you took 17 18 19, it's around 4%.\n\nNow 'twenty was gigantic 12, 5% six 5% in 'twenty, one so its going to float down over time, you would expect it would go back to around four 5%, but.\n\nThe expectation for 'twenty, two would be higher than that Barry anything you want to add to that.\n\nNo you got it right again, historically, Peter three 4% has been kind of a weighted average growth of the category is that rent obviously elevated in 2020 still high in 'twenty. One there are a number of them that are going to benefit from some of the trends that I touched on vitamins.\n\nNew behavior, that's more permanent and were in more and more households, and invite them into our overall of course, so theres a few that will continue to benefit but I think there is a reversion to more normal levels as things return back to normal so is that in the 4% range versus 6% I think that's a safe assumption.\n\nOkay got it that's super helpful. And then I guess, maybe like a follow up on and kind of the underlying assumption around like a normal and cold and flu season is there a way to.\n\nHow much of a benefit just a normal season will be in terms of our total company organic revenue growth is.\n\nIs that included in your guidance already for 22 or would that be like a source of upside.\n\nYes.\n\nI'll give you a little bit of context on number one in colors shortening its got a 76% share.\n\nBut the recent trends are certainly encouraging so if you look at consumption in Q4, 'twenty one versus 'twenty. It was up 21%. So it is the brand. We brought we bought for the long term and expect it to we do expect it to be a contributor to sales and profits in 'twenty, two we wouldn't necessarily call out what the what the.\n\nNet sales number is for a particular brand yes, I mean, we think it's going to get to be more like a normal flu season, but probably not all the way to bright yes, we're not going to get all the way back yeah.\n\nI think that'll happen in 'twenty three.\n\nOkay awesome. Thank you for that and best of luck.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chapell with twist. Your line is open.\n\nThanks, Good morning.\n\nBill.\n\nHey, just a few.\n\nQuick ones one on pricing.\n\nThe 80% level why isn't that 100% now just because it seems like everybody's pricing everything.\n\nAs we look forward over the next few months will that number go to a 100% or as the next round of pricing more incremental pricing on the first 80%.\n\nSure Bill.\n\nThat's very critical.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nInquisitive.\n\nYeah, Yeah, well look I know, there's some things that.\n\nWe didn't raise price on in.\n\nIn 'twenty one that we're looking ahead to price in 'twenty, two we're not going to get all the way to 100%, but we expect to get above above 80. Some categories that we haven't priced on we just bought into the mouthwash category and write that that'd be one. So ICANN is another one and we found that for a year. So we haven't taken price on that.\n\nAnything that we intend to take price and we've already baked in so it's not you shouldn't be thinking that that's going to be all upside and there are some areas, where there hasnt been cost inflation. There are small, but there are scenarios, where that hasn't happened and you don't have a cost story to go back to retailers and a few a few brands like condoms for example, Latexes isn't rocket.\n\nRight, but I would say overall, we expect the 80% to go a little bit higher and we also expect.\n\nRevisit price increases we've already made.\n\nGot it on the line of inquisitive not critical.\n\nI get the this is a normal practice every year have you have tax benefits or other benefits and plow it back into marketing and kind of third and fourth quarter, but why does it makes sense in this year's fourth quarter, when you're having low fill rates to put more into marketing, which would seem to exacerbate the issue.\n\nYes.\n\nThere were certain brands, particularly personal care that we decided to perform money.\n\nBehind where our fill rates were not as bad that might've been neglected earlier in the year. So batiste.\n\nWould be would be one of those water pik would be another uneven Sarah breath, even though we own just for a week or so we spend money behind that because we want to get that off to a good start. So we put some money behind that late December .\n\nGot it so it was more selective and kind of how you reinvest that money.\n\nYeah right. It wasn't peanut butter was very targeted got it and then lastly, just on the capacity expansions you have talked about I mean, I understand especially on vitamins it takes longer but it would seem that especially for something like cat litter and maybe for detergent.\n\nThe euro facility could be expanded fairly quickly and that you could have those expect the capacity by mid year or sometime this year is that not the right way as does it take that much longer.\n\nYes, I would say in general Bill It takes about 18 months for a capacity project.\n\nAnd Youre right, we have available space in the network not necessarily just York, but in the network, but those capital projects are running into the same things that are happening all over the globe and macro economy in terms of labor availability and timing of.\n\nMachinery and stuff like that Rick respond anything you have to add on that one.\n\nYes, the only thing I would add thanks, thanks, Rick.\n\nIs that.\n\nSome cases were doing capacity increases on top of capacity increases I mean, our litter volume.\n\nVolume growth has been explosive and and so we're putting more money into the capacity increases there. So.\n\nSo that's.\n\nThat's part of the dynamic and then the other piece of it is just what Rick said, our lead times on equipment that we're purchasing for these capacity increases have increased pretty dramatically versus what they were pre COVID-19 because.\n\nThose supply chains are also impacted.\n\nGot it thanks.\n\nThanks, so much.\n\nThanks Bill.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nA little bit more maybe.\n\nThe impact of supply constraints. It looks like your fill rates were still quite reasonable and maybe just inventories are low.\n\nBut was there any impact on your top line from lack of supply anywhere.\n\nYes, certainly I think we've been pretty clear. These last few quarters that when you look at shipping to consumption right are our consumption in Q4 was anywhere between 6% to 7%.\n\nAnd our domestic organic.\n\nRate was three 5% and so that's been a pretty pretty consistent GAAP. These last few quarters. That's also why we think we're going to have a high.\n\nHigh range in 2022, I guess, the supply chain improves and Madden respond both commented on how thats going to sequentially improve through the year. That's also going to be a tailwind next year. Yeah. So it's a short story is that we did leave money on the table because of difficulties with getting supply.\n\nGot it and then on capacity are there I guess, particularly for vitamins is.\n\nThese are your own facilities now or is it capex going into something you might need to contribute to a co packer or something.\n\nAnd then if you're willing to kind of share.\n\nWhat some sort of what's sort of underlying growth are you expecting for that category within the context of the decision to spend more to increase capacity.\n\nYeah. So the capital that we're contributing is actually internal capacity for gummy manufacturing. We're also working with third party manufacturers to increase our capacity, but no capital contributions there.\n\nThe growth rate if you look back right. When we bought this business the percent of gummies.\n\nFor hard pills and the total vitamin category was 3% now we are in the Twenty's and we have long term vision to that's going to continue to go to the $30 40 as over time. So we think that growth rate as high as what I would tell you.\n\nGot it thank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nThanks, Good morning, I just had.\n\nTwo questions one why is.\n\nIn terms of retailer reaction to fill some of these supply chain challenges that been having and I think during , you talked about kind of points very rationally pulling some of the promotional support.\n\nBecause of those lower not wanting to exacerbate the supply demand issue. So just curious what kind of retailer reaction.\n\nSeems like some of your supply issues, maybe at this point are a bit worse than what youre seeing from some from competitors in your category. So I was curious that that was one.\n\nAnd then the second thing was and I apologize if I missed this the 7% price mix in the queue.\n\nQuarter for consumer domestic how much of that was lower promotion versus list because if I just think about that was it 50% pricing that we're going to 80 or are we going into double digit pricing in 'twenty. Two when we look at the P&L or again is that with some of that just lower promotion and more a matter of timing.\n\nYes, maybe I'll take that one first so I will give the Paul you can you can respond to the question about retailers, but Europe first Rick Okay.\n\nSo the positive price mix in the quarter was but remember 50% of the pricing activity has happened.\n\nBut there is also lower trade spending and lower promotional spending and that number as well.\n\nIn 2022, we tried to dimensionalize. It on an earlier question and I had said that the four 5% organic was really five 5% price mix favorability throughout the year.\n\nSo hopefully that can give you a sense of what it is.\n\nAnd we've said in the release also Lauren that we do expect to be spending back more on trade in the back half of this year as our supply chain normalizes, but Paul any retail.\n\nSupply constraint.\n\nColor you want to guess.\n\nYes, Lauren it's good question and I think the difference that we're getting ahead of now is the partnership with Rick's bonds organization and my sales organization to sit with some of these key retailers and give them a more transparent overview.\n\nSome cases that meant we couldnt commit to maybe some further out promotions for those retailers that need longer lead times and promote just because of the uncertainty in that inconsistency.\n\nComment on competitiveness, and where others are candidly, it's a little different across you can imagine all of the categories. We play in but I would say.\n\nThe partnership the communication and communication I mean, more weekly and biweekly communication, which normally doesn't happen. So if anything we've tightened the at least the understanding and the trust. If you will between us and the retailers that could kind of help to the burdens and the fines and fees and those discussions but really.\n\nWe want to be upfront and make sure that we're not holding them out to dry with a promotion or an end cap and just being transparent so not easy conversations Loren and I don't want you to misinterpret, but yes.\n\nYes, I'd say transparency would probably be the word of the choice to answer your question simply.\n\nOkay. That's great. Thanks, so much I appreciate it.\n\nThanks Lauren.\n\nThank you and ladies and gentlemen that concludes the Q&A I will now turn the call back to Mr. .\n\nHey, thanks to everybody for joining us we had a spectacular in 'twenty, one and hope to have another good one and 'twenty two and we'll talk to everybody at the end of April after Q1, so thanks for joining us today.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nSure.\n\nThanks.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nUh huh.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nThanks.\n\nThanks.\n\nYes.\n\nUh huh.\n\nYes.\n\nGreat.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat.\n\nThank you.\n\n[music].\n\nSure.\n\nBruce.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nThank you.\n\nYes.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\n[music].\n\nSure.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nGood morning.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nThank you.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nSure.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah.\n\n[music].\n\nYeah.\n\n[music].\n\nYes."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY's consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm here with Robin Vince, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference the quarterly update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. And I'll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and quarterly update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 16, 2025, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nVice Chair & CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start with a few highlights before Dermot takes you through our financials for the quarter in greater detail. As summarized on Page 2 of our quarterly update presentation, BNY reported another quarter of strong results. Record revenue of $5.1 billion was up 9% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength, including double-digit revenue growth across the platforms that make up our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, and we drove approximately 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our pretax margin improved to 36% and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 26%. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.88, up 25% year-over-year.\nThe third quarter presented a largely constructive operating environment. Despite a cooling labor market and inflation lingering above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, the U.S. economy remained resilient. Equity markets continued to climb, credit spreads remained tight, and the Fed ultimately resumed rate cuts. Across our platforms, we saw solid growth in client balances as well as robust trading, clearing and settlement activity. While the finalization of U.S. tax legislation and the prospect of deregulation are positives for the economic outlook, uncertainty and multiple tail risks remain, geopolitical conditions, trade policies, fiscal deficits around the world and the sustainability of enthusiastic markets to name a few.\nAgainst this backdrop, we continue to execute on our mission of reimagining BNY. This includes our 2 core transformation programs, a new commercial model, and our platform's operating model. Both are continuing to show results, and both have a lot of runway ahead. We recently reached the 1-year anniversary of the new commercial model. Year 1 was about bringing the company together, aligning our teams and proving that when we show up as 1 BNY, we can win. Now we are raising the bar. The next phase of our commercial model is about embedding the habits of operating as 1 BNY into our daily rhythms and shifting from just connecting the dots to also delivering integrated solutions with patient scale.\nWe were pleased to announce several wins in the third quarter that demonstrate how BNY is powering growth for our clients, both long-standing and new. Franklin Templeton, a client for nearly 3 decades expanded its relationship with BNY to provide a full suite of asset servicing and FX capabilities for its U.S.-listed ETF products, tapping our market-leading platform to support one of its fastest growing businesses. And TIAA, who has had a 20-year relationship with BNY Pershing, yesterday announced that they have selected our Wove platform as the unified wealth solution across TIAA Wealth Management's broker-dealer, investment adviser and bank custody businesses.\nOur early commitment to the digital asset space paired with the principles of safety, scalability and innovation that have defined BNY for centuries now positions us to support the growing institutional adoption of digital asset products. In just 1 example from this past quarter, OpenEden, a leading platform for the tokenization of real-world assets headquartered in Singapore, appointed BNY as investment manager and primary custodian for the underlying assets of its flagship tokenized U.S. treasury bills fund.\nAs global capital markets move toward an always-on operating model, blockchain technology and digital asset adoption are becoming important enablers. In a meaningful step toward enhancing the utility of money market fund shares, we announced a collaborative initiative with Goldman Sachs to maintain on blockchain technology, a mirror record of customers' ownership of select money market funds, live and available through our LiquidityDirect platform. This includes a new token enabled share class of our own BNY Investments, Dreyfus Treasury Securities Cash Management Fund. We are encouraged by developments in the U.S. regulatory landscape that will further enable tokenized products and allow us to support clients as they consider moving to a more unchained financial world. All of this product innovation, combined with our commercial model 2.0 is allowing us to be more for our clients and drive higher and more sustainable organic growth in the years to come.\nTurning to another one of our transformation, the ongoing transition into our platform's operating model. More than 70% of employees are now working in the model, and we expect to complete the remaining transition over the course of the next year. It is still early days, but we continue to gather meaningful proof points of benefits. For example, faster client onboarding, more automated delivery of complex NAVs and more modern billing processes. Our progress in the model is creating real capacity to invest in growth, to innovate for clients and to power our culture. Our experience has been that it takes 12 to 18 months after the initial activation of a platform for teams to start realizing the full benefits of this new way of working. That means that while we will be entirely operational in the new model by the fall of next year, we don't expect to see the full benefits of these new operating rhythms until early 2028.\nAs we continue making steady progress on both of our 2 transformations as well as the broader reimagining of our company, we are always focused on what's next. A prime example of this is how we are embracing the power and benefits of AI. This past quarter, we announced a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to create the BNY AI lab at CMU. By bringing together CMU's academic leadership and BNY's market expertise, we will advance AI research, responsible governance and deployment. At BNY, AI is for everyone, everywhere and for everything. The investments we've made have been focused on creating the technology foundation to go faster, but adoption and success are ultimately driven by culture. By putting AI in the hands of everyone at BNY, we intend to develop fluency and create capacity for our people to focus on higher-value work. This translates to how we show up for our clients and innovate more broadly.\nLast month, we launched the next version of BNY's AI platform, Eliza 2.0, smarter, faster and easier to use. Across the company, our people are working together to embed AI solutions into our workflows. By the end of the third quarter, we had 117 AI solutions in production. That is an increase of 75% compared to the prior quarter, and it includes agents that help identify new business leads, rate code, automate payment processing, accelerate client onboarding and increase automation of reconciliations. We are also leveraging Agentic AI to deploy digital employees. Over 100 of them are already working side by side with our people on tasks such as payment validations and code repairs. We believe our AI opportunity is significant, and we are pursuing it with urgency.\nBefore I hand it over to Dermot, I want to close by acknowledging the tremendous work of our people. As I visit our offices around the world and spend time with our teams, the excitement and drive within the company is palpable. It is our people and culture that propel us forward on our mission to unlock BNY's full potential for our clients and our shareholders. We are executing with purpose, powering our culture to run our company better so that we can be more for our clients. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but the clear signs of progress both in terms of our reported financials and the leading indicators for future success across the company give us confidence that the strategy is working.\nWith that, over to you, Dermot.\n\nDermot William McDonogh\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our consolidated financial results for the third quarter on Page 3 of the presentation. Total revenue of $5.1 billion was up 9% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 7%. That included 10% growth in Investment Services fees from our Security Services and Market & Wealth Services segment, driven by net new business, higher client activity and market values. Investment management and performance fees were down 2%, reflecting the mix of AUM flows, the adjustment for certain rebates we discussed in prior quarters and lower performance fees, partially offset by higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.\nWhile not on the page, I will note that firm-wide AUC/A of $57.8 trillion were up 11% year-over-year, reflecting client inflows and higher market values. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were flat year-over-year, reflecting higher market values offset by cumulative net outflows. Foreign exchange revenue was down 5% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of corporate treasury activity, partially offset by growth in client activity. Investment and other revenue was $208 million in the quarter, including a $12 million disposal gain. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 18% year-over-year, driven by continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $7 million in the quarter, primarily driven by changes in the macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by higher reserves related to commercial real estate exposure. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 4% year-over-year, both on a reported and an adjusted basis. The variance, excluding notable items, reflects higher investments, employee merit increases, higher revenue-related expenses and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings.\nTaken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.88, up 25% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share were $1.91, up 26% year-over-year. Our reported pretax margin was 36%, and our return on tangible common equity was 26% in the quarter.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the third quarter was 6.1%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 11.7%, up from 11.5% in the prior quarter, reflecting capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends. Risk-weighted assets were up 1% sequentially. Over the course of the third quarter, we returned approximately $1.2 billion of capital to our common shareholders, resulting in a 92% total payout ratio year-to-date.\nWith regards to liquidity, the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 112%, flat sequentially. And the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 130% compared to 131% in the prior quarter.\nNext, net interest income and balance sheet trends on Page 5. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 18% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially, net interest income increased due to reinvestment of maturing securities at higher yields, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Average deposit balances were flat sequentially, as the typical seasonal decline over the summer was offset by idiosyncratic client balances related to CLO activity and M&A escrows. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew by 3% and interest-bearing deposits were down by 1% quarter-over-quarter. Accordingly, average interest-earning assets were also flat sequentially. Cash and reverse repo balances decreased by 2%, loans increased by 2% and investment securities balances increased by 1% quarter-over-quarter.\nTurning to our business segments, starting on Page 6. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Total Investment Services fees were also up 11% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, Investment Services fees increased by 12%, representing strong year-over-year growth, driven by higher client activity and market values. As we support our clients in building their businesses on the strength of our platforms, we are also benefiting from secular growth in attractive markets. In the third quarter, our ETF AUC/A outperformed market growth and increased by 35% year-over-year, driven by higher market values, client inflows and net new business. And alternatives AUC/A grew by 12% year-over-year with particular strength in our Private Markets segment.\nIt is also worth highlighting that almost half of all Asset Servicing wins in the quarter represented multiline of business solutions, underscoring the growing effectiveness of our one BNY strategy and the enablement through our new commercial model. In Issuer Services, Investment Services fees were up 10%, primarily driven by strong client activity in depository receipts. Across the segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 4% year-over-year on the back of higher client volumes. Net interest income for the segment was up 10% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were up 6% year-over-year, driven by higher investments, severance revenue-related expenses and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Security Services reported pretax income of $806 million, up 26% year-over-year and a pretax margin of 33%.\nOn to Market and Wealth Services on Page 7. In our Market and Wealth Services segment, we reported total revenue of $1.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Total Investment Services fees were up 9% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 7%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. Net new assets were $3 billion in the quarter, driven by inflows from existing and new clients, partially offset by the deconversion of business lost in the prior year. Going forward, we expect net new asset growth to reaccelerate as we completed this previously disclosed deconversion in the third quarter. In Clearance and Collateral Management, Investment Services fees were up 12%, driven by broad-based growth in collateral management balances and clearance volumes. Average collateral balances increased 14% year-over-year, with growth from both existing and new clients. And in Treasury Services, Investment Services fees were up 7%, primarily reflecting net new business. Net interest income for the segment was up 26% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $895 million were up 7% year-over-year, driven by higher investments, employee merit increases and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Market and Wealth Services segment reported pretax income of $875 million, up 24% year-over-year and a pretax margin of 50%.\nTurning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 8. Our Investments in Wealth Management segment reported total revenue of $824 million, down 3% year-over-year. Investment Management fees were down 1% year-over-year, driven by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates, partially offset by the impact of higher market values and the weaker dollar. Segment expenses of $640 million were down 5% year-over-year, driven by lower revenue-related expenses and efficiency savings, partially offset by employee merit increases, higher investments and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Investment and Wealth Management reported pretax income of $184 million, up 5% year-over-year, and our pretax margin expanded to 22%.\nAs I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion were flat year-over-year. In the third quarter, we saw $33 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $34 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth Management client assets of $348 billion increased by 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher market values, partially offset by cumulative net outflows.\nReflecting on our Investment and Wealth Management segment for a moment. Under new leadership over the past year, we have begun taking important steps to reorganize, streamline operations and start enabling the business to leverage BNY's broader portfolio of platforms. Additionally, we have started bolstering the team with a number of strategic hires and internal moves to further strengthen product, distribution and client coverage expertise. Along the way, we are being mindful of protecting the unique investment processes of our individual investment firms. While we are still in the very early stages of unlocking the growth opportunities associated with Investment and Wealth Management, Security Services and Pershing truly pulling in the same direction, we are encouraged by the progress over the past few months.\nPage 9 shows the results of the other segments. For this segment, I'll just note that the year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily driven by higher net securities losses and the sequential increase primarily reflects gains realized on the sale of real estate.\nI'll close with our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. On the back of a strong third quarter, we expect net interest income in the fourth quarter to be approximately flat sequentially, which would ultimately result in full year 2025 net interest income to be up 12% year-over-year. We continue to expect expenses, excluding notable items for the full year to be up approximately 3% year-over-year. We currently project our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21%, which would bring our effective tax rate for the full year into a range of 21% to 22%. And finally, we expect to continue returning capital at a pace that is consistent with a total payout ratio of 90% to 100% for the full year 2025.\nTo conclude, our results reflect the disciplined execution and collective effort of our teams around the world. We are encouraged by our progress and remain focused on delivering consistent long-term value for our clients and shareholders.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line?",

Good morning and welcome to the 2025 second quarter earnings conference call hosted by BNY. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations and Corporate Development and Co-Head of Business Finance, BNY\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm here with Robin Vince, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. We will reference the quarterly update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I'll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.\nActual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and quarterly update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 15 July 2025, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nThanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before Dermot takes you through the financials in greater detail, I'll start with a few summary remarks on our strong performance in the second quarter and a couple of reflections on the first half of the year.\nStepping back for a moment to look at the operating environment, we began the quarter in April with elevated market volatility, record US equity trading activity, and increased Treasury market volumes. Through the quarter, we saw shifts in global policy with elevated risk from geopolitical tensions and conflicts, as well as uncertainty around trade, fiscal, and other policies. Periods of volatility and active markets give BNY the opportunity to deepen the connection with our clients, helping them grow while navigating an evolving business landscape. Our unique position as a financial services platforms company at the heart of the world's capital markets, combined with our diversified business model, allowed us to once again demonstrate our resilience and commercial strength against this backdrop. Turning to the results of the second quarter and referring to page two of the quarterly update presentation, BNY delivered a strong performance.\nEarnings per share of $1.93 were up 27% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 28% excluding notable items. Total revenue was up 9% year-over-year and for the first time exceeded $5 billion in a quarter. In combination with expense growth of 4%, BNY generated another quarter of significant positive operating leverage, roughly 500 basis points on both a reported and operating basis. In what is seasonally our strongest quarter, our pre-tax margin improved to 37%, and our return on tangible common equity improved to 28%. These are clear outputs from our multi-year transformation and robust indicators of BNY's potential. Turning to page three, over the past few years, we have been laying the foundations for our future.\nIn our January update, we outlined how BNY is well-positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends as we work hard to generate alpha through the continued transformation of our company. We entered 2025 with good momentum. Midway through the year, we are seeing results from our consistent execution and continuous delivery that add to our confidence for the medium to long term. Our strategy is simple but powerful: to be more for our clients by running our company better, all powered by our culture. I'll briefly touch on each. First, our commercial model enables BNY to be more for our clients, helping them achieve their goals using the full breadth and depth of our platforms. As we mark the model's one-year anniversary, early signs point to the growing effectiveness of our commercial organization with significant runway ahead. We achieved a second consecutive quarter of record sales.\nThe number of multi-product relationships continues to grow, and we continue to broaden and deepen our engagement with clients. For example, in June, we expanded our relationship with specialist active UK asset manager Liontrust. In addition to utilizing our Data Vault and middle office operating capabilities, Liontrust is fully outsourcing its trading to our buy-side trading solutions team, which delivers 24-hour global trade execution and reaches 100 markets globally across all major asset classes. Another important way for us to be more for our clients is to deliver innovative solutions to the market that come from the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY. As I've said before, we're not just in the product sales business. We're in the solutions delivery business. BNY enjoys a suite of highly adjacent platforms that, when delivered together, create powerful solutions for clients.\nOur Commercial Model, combined with our Platform's Operating Model, are intentionally designed to encourage more of this type of innovation. An example of this solution's mindset is our work to build the financial infrastructure of the future by bridging traditional and digital financial ecosystems to enable clients to unlock new capabilities securely and at scale. Early and continuous investments in our digital assets platform have positioned us to meet increasing institutional interest and adoption. Last month, Société Générale selected BNY to act as reserve custodian for their first USD stablecoin in Europe. Last week, Ripple announced that BNY will act as primary custodian of Ripple's USD stablecoin reserves. Today, BNY is a leader in servicing the growing stablecoin market, enabling companies to create and use stablecoins by providing wide-ranging services from issuance to ongoing operations.\nOur advancements in the digital assets ecosystem are just one example of continual innovation, but there are many others: flexible financing in global clearing, the integration of Collateral One into LiquidityDirect, FX HedgeDirect for private markets, Agency Lending in Saudi Arabia, Depository Receipts in Canada, to name just a few. This is an important theme for us, not just periodic higher-profile product launches, but product-level micro-innovations, week by week, month by month, that drive our organic growth. Next, on running our company better with purpose, 2025 will be a milestone year for BNY's transition into our platform's operating model, which realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire company. As a reminder, running our company better is not just about expenses. It's about better. Yes, we are driving efficiency, but we're also enabling commercial opportunities, enhancing client journeys, and accelerating speed to market.\nWith more than half of our people at BNY working in the model today, we remain on track to complete our phased transition into the platform's operating model by this time next year. Already, we are starting to see the impact of this new way of working, enabling our people to launch more new solutions, deploy more code releases, and come together better than ever before to support our clients. Finally, on culture. Culture is about generating a collective will to make our company achieve its full potential, harnessing the breadth of our talent to be there for clients and to help the company hum. This includes so many things, but one part of that enablement is our embrace of AI. It's an exciting moment for AI at BNY.\nNearly all of our employees are using our multi-agentic enterprise AI platform, Eliza, and we have started to introduce digital employees into our workforce. It's early days, but we are beginning to see the benefit of some of these agents and digital employees, and we expect that to accelerate in the quarters and years ahead. To wrap up, against the backdrop of a busy operating environment, our priorities are clear, and we remain relentlessly focused on execution. BNY is showing strong momentum, and we are determined to deliver further value for our clients, our shareholders, and our people. At this midpoint of the year, we are pleased to see the initial work of our multi-year transformation bearing fruit. I'd like to thank our teams around the world for delivering strong results and for their continued commitment to the work ahead.\nWe have a lot of opportunity in front of us, but the strategy to unlock it is working. With that, over to you, Dermot.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I'm starting with our consolidated financial results for the second quarter on page four of the presentation. Total revenue of $5 billion was up 9% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 7%. That included 9% growth in investment services fees from our securities services and market and wealth services segments, driven by net new business, client activity, and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were flat. Growth from higher market values and the impact of a weaker US dollar was offset by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates that we discussed on our last earnings call.\nWhile not on the page, I will note that firm-wide AUCA of $55.8 trillion were up 13% year-over-year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values, and the impact of the weaker dollar. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and the impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows. Foreign exchange revenue was up 16% year-over-year on the back of elevated volatility and higher volumes, partially offset by the impact of corporate treasury activity. Investment and other revenue was $184 million, including $35 million of net losses from investment security sales, partially offset by favorable seed capital and other investments results. Net interest income was up 17% year-over-year, driven by continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix.\nProvision for credit losses was a benefit of $17 million in the quarter, driven by property-specific reserve releases in our commercial real estate portfolio. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 4% year-over-year, both on a reported basis and excluding notable items. The variance excluding notable items reflects higher investments, employee merit increases, higher revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.93 on a reported basis, up 27% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share were $1.94, up 28% year-over-year. Our pre-tax margin was 37%, and our return on tangible common equity was 28% in the quarter. Turning to capital and liquidity on page five.\nAt the end of June, the Federal Reserve released the results of its 2025 bank stress test, which once again underscored BNY's resilient business model and our strong balance sheet. The results also confirmed that our stress capital buffer remains unchanged at the regulatory floor of 2.5%. With regards to our second quarter results, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%, down 17 basis points sequentially. Tier 1 capital increased by $689 million, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned through common stock repurchases, and dividends. Average assets increased, primarily driven by deposit growth. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter.\nOver the course of the second quarter, we returned approximately $1.2 billion of capital to our common shareholders, resulting in a 92% total payout ratio year to date. With regards to liquidity, the consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 112%, down four percentage sequentially, reflecting elevated deposit balances, which were largely non-operational in early parts of the quarter. The consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio was 131%, down one percentage point sequentially. Next, Net Interest Income and balance sheet trends on page six. Consistent with the backdrop of elevated volatility and active trading in capital markets, we saw clients seek the strength of BNY's balance sheet and leverage our platforms for execution and settlement. Net Interest Income of $1.2 billion was up 17% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter.\nBoth the year-over-year and sequential increase primarily reflect continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Average deposit balances grew by 6% sequentially. Non-interest-bearing deposits grew by 3% in the quarter, and interest-bearing deposits grew by 7%. Accordingly, average interest-earning assets increased by 6% sequentially. Cash and reverse repo balances increased by 9%. Investment securities balances increased by 4%, and loans increased by 2%. Turning to our business segments starting on page seven. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Total Investment Services fees were up 10% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, Investment Services fees grew by 7%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. In Issuer Services, Investment Services fees were up 17%, driven by exceptionally strong client activity in our depository receipts business.\nIn this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 22% year-over-year on the back of elevated volatility and higher volumes. Net interest income for the segment was up 13% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher investments, employee merit increases, revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings. Securities services reported pre-tax income of $867 million, up 26% year-over-year, and a pre-tax margin of 35%. Onto market and wealth services on page eight. In our market and wealth services segment, we reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 9% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 8%, reflecting client activity and higher market values. Net new assets were a negative $10 billion in the quarter, reflecting the deconversion of a client that was acquired by a self-clearing competitor.\nIn clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 14%, driven by broad-based growth in collateral balances and clearance volumes. In treasury services, investment services fees were up 3%, reflecting net new business. Net interest income for the segment was up 21% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $897 million were up 8% year-over-year, driven by higher investments and litigation reserves, employee merit increases, and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our market and wealth services segment reported pre-tax income of $851 million, up 21% year-over-year, and a pre-tax margin of 49%. Turning to investment and wealth management on page nine. Our investment and wealth management segment reported total revenue of $801 million, down 2% year-over-year.\nInvestment management fees were down 1% year-over-year, driven by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates, partially offset by higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. Segment expenses of $653 million were down 2% year-over-year, driven by lower revenue-related expenses and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher severance expense and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Investment and wealth management reported pre-tax income of $148 million, down 1% year-over-year, and a pre-tax margin of 19%. As I described earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 3% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we saw $17 billion of net outflows driven by index, multi-asset, and equity strategies, partially offset by net inflows into cash and fixed income strategies. Wealth management client assets of $339 billion increased by 10% year-over-year, largely driven by higher market values.\nPage ten shows the results of the other segment. For this segment, I'll just note that the sequential decrease in revenue primarily reflects the net losses from investment securities activity I mentioned earlier, while the sequential decrease in expenses reflects lower litigation reserves and severance. Turning to page eleven, I'll close with a mid-year update of the financial outlook for 2025 that we provided on our earnings call in January. As you can see on the slide, BNY is entering the second half of the year with great momentum, while we remain cognizant of the economic outlook amid elevated geopolitical and policy uncertainty. Based on where we sit today, looking out to the balance of the year, we now expect full year 2025 net interest income to be up high single-digit percentage points year-over-year. We continue to expect solid fee revenue growth in 2025, of course, market dependent.\nWe now expect expenses excluding notable items for the year to be up approximately 3% year-over-year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be in the 22% to 23% range. Considering our 21% tax rate in the first half, that means approximately 23% for the second half of the year. We continue to expect to return roughly 100% ± of 2025 earnings through common dividends and buybacks over the course of the year. Following the release of the Federal Reserve's annual bank stress test, our board of directors declared a 13% increase of our quarterly common stock dividend, and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program. As always, we consider macroeconomic and interest rate environments, balance sheet growth, and many other factors with a conservative bias in managing the pace of our buybacks.\nTo wrap up, BNY posted very strong results in Q2, demonstrating the impact of consistent execution and delivery amid a complex, but yet for BNY, constructive operating environment. The momentum of our multi-year transformation continues to build, and progress to date gives us incremental confidence in BNY's great potential for the medium and long term. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad now. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nMorning, Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nMaybe, Robin, for you, the call in terms of the transformation efforts, digital assets, AI just sounds like significant runway on all things organic.\nAddress for us how you are thinking about capital deployment relative to where the stock's trading at today. And I'm sure this is not news to you in terms of news around BNY pursuing a merger with a competitor, your interview in Barron's. So give us a sense of, when we think about capital deployment as shareholders, how should we think what the priority is outside of funding the business, be it buybacks versus M&A? Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nSure. So look, the beginning point of what you said is actually the most important thing. We have got strong momentum. We really see the pathway to be able to generate value over the medium and long term. Obviously, you're seeing some of the early signs of that, and we're pleased with it.\nThat is our biggest focus because at the end of the day, at the top of the capital waterfall is that ability to invest in the business. Now, look, the good news is that we're a pretty capital-light business. You can see it in the 28% ROTCE that we generated in the quarter. We're pleased with that. That's another sign of the transition and transformation of the company towards this more platforms orientation because that is the sort of feature that you'd expect of a company in terms of the direction of travel that we've got going. Now, in terms of the sort of the inorganic stuff, look, our broad approach hasn't changed, which is, M&A done well, can be a powerful tool in the toolkit.\nIt's not our custom to comment on any specific rumor or speculation, but I think we demonstrated last year with the Archer acquisition that we've got the ability to make M&A work for us in a sensible way. Having said that, I just really want to underscore this point. It's a very high bar for us for M&A, especially a larger transaction. It would have to make a ton of sense. We'd need to have a lot of conviction and execution. We're focused on ongoing alignment with our strategic priorities. Strong cultural fit matters. And of course, the financials really have to work. Our M&A story is a two-sided story as well because you saw that last year. We bought Archer, but we sold our corporate trust Canada business. The punchline I'll leave you with is we are focused on our organic growth. That is working.\nWe are beginning the process of a multi-year journey on that. And we're going to be open because we should be open to sensible things inorganically if they make sense, but I'll underline again, if they make sense.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's very clear. Thank you. And I guess maybe just following up on that, you referenced the 27% ROTCE this quarter. I get it's a seasonally strong quarter. But as we think about, again, relative to new investors trying to put money to work in the stock, if structurally, based on all the work you've done so far over the last few years and where things are going, is it safe for investors, shareholders, the street to assume that this is becoming a high 20s ROTCE institution, which should then support a very different multiple than we've been used to for the last several years? Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nSo look, I'll blend sort of two things together here. One is the broader medium-term targets as we think about them. We have not put a ceiling on any of our medium-term targets. We viewed them as milestones on a longer journey. At the time that we first communicated them, people understandably thought about them as ambitious based on where we had been in the past. But we are on a journey here, and we are making important steps forward. And so on ROTCE specifically, we don't see a ceiling on that number because as a more platforms-oriented company, remember, NII is only 25% of our revenues. View that as broadly a proxy for the balance sheet, which means 3/4 of our business is largely a pretty capital-light business that's driving forward in terms of fee growth.\nSo I would just look generally at our medium-term targets, and I would throw ROTCE, your question into that as well, and say we have a lot of ambition. We think we're relatively early in our journey, and we're absolutely going to be moving the bar higher on ourselves, which frankly we do every single day in terms of how we run the company.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nPerfect. Thank you, Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Ken Houston with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Houston\n\nResearch Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about just the evolution of, as the year goes on, of just overall top-of-the-house performance because obviously you're taking up your NII guide, but NII is only 25% of revenues.\nAnd while the cost guide is up, I think that maybe misses the point that on the fee side, your guide is only just for year-over-year, and here we are plus 6% in the second quarter and plus 7% for the year to date. So I'm just wondering on the fee side, are fees better than your original expectations too, and is that informing as much as the NII upside, the slight tick up on the overall cost guide as the total is coming in better?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nHey, Ken, I'll start with that. Look, the way I kind of think about the firm is I start with overall positive operating leverage. And I guess a key message I would leave you there, both on operating and reported basis, I think it was roughly 500 basis points of operating leverage.\nAnd so since Robin took over as CEO, we've kind of made the positive operating leverage our North Star. And so consistently delivering that to the market has been our kind of the core strategy around how we think about the financials. So you have three components to that. You've got fees, you've got NII, and you've got expenses. And you'll see from the financials, yeah, revenue up 9%, expenses up 4%, delivering that positive operating leverage. Within the revenue, you've got fees, you've got NII, really solid performance on NII, which gives us comfort around for the balance of the year, giving a higher guide to kind of high single digits. And on the revenue side, I think the strength in fees really underscores the Commercial Model that we launched about a year ago, two consecutive quarters of kind of record sales.\nNotwithstanding that, the second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter, so we would expect strong sales. But that was on the back of a Q1. And we see going into Q3, although it is a kind of seasonally slower quarter for us given the vacations, etc., we see kind of strong momentum continuing. So you see a picture on page three of the mid-year update where we kind of show you a little pictorial about how we think about organic growth. And we have high conviction around that beginning to build and grow.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nAnd Ken, let me just build on a couple of things that Dermot said. So first of all, yes, it was a constructive environment in the second quarter. But I'll bring you back to our comments in January when we talked about the various different things that drive our business.\nWe've intentionally been repositioning the company gradually to be able to take advantage of more different types of environments. So I think the punchline is, while there are always amazing environments that you could have for a business or potentially environments which just don't have any element of being particularly constructive, we think we're broadening out the probabilities of any given environment actually working reasonably well for us because equity markets up, fixed income markets up, equity volumes up, fixed income volumes up, transaction volumes and GDP up, issuance up, asset management activity, and wealth management activity. There are a lot of cylinders in this particular engine. So the second quarter was constructive, but we have been positioning the company to be able to take advantage of more and more environments as constructive.\nAnd I think that, plus the point that Dermot made around our commercial model, is allowing us to grind organic growth higher. So we want to take advantage of the beta. We want to be able to participate in whatever the quarter happens to bring. But this constant focus on alpha generation in terms of how we're running the company and positioning the company is an important part of the story. And we do think that this is a quarter where you're starting to see that. But again, the early earnings point that Dermot and I have made many times before, there's a lot of runway here in our estimation.\n\nKen Houston\n\nResearch Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nUnderstood. That's very color. And I do like that upper right chart on page three. Just one thing on the environment then. You've talked previously about just the stickiness of deposits, and obviously that's informing the better-than-expected NII outlook.\nDoes anything change in the environment at that point? Because I think Robin will bring back in your point about tools in the kit and arsenal to just continue to add deposits. But maybe you can just help us understand the environmental side a little bit. Thank you.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nSo I think point number one here that I would make, Ken, is as a matter of strategy, we don't really lead with deposits. So when you see deposits being a little bit higher, the mix of IB and NIB a little bit higher, it really speaks to the breadth and the depth of the franchise and doing more with clients. And doing more with clients attracts deposits.\nSpecifically around Q2 in our corporate trust business, we had higher levels of activity, and we were able to kind of help clients with unique specific situations that attracted deposits into the system, particularly on the NII side. That was able for us to kind of have a good NII print this quarter. When we look out for the balance of the year and run our various scenarios, we really have reduced the tails with respect to interest rate sensitivity. That was really on the back of a ton of work done towards the back end of last year when the Fed made the pivot after Jackson Hole around the forward rate curve. So that gives us now a lot of confidence to be able to kind of provide that higher NII growth against what is a constructive backdrop for us.\n\nKen Houston\n\nResearch Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks very much, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks very much. With so much going well, forgive me, I'm going to pick on the one area that wasn't as good as everything else in investment management. So fees down a little bit, flows out, margins down in that 19% range, despite the good market. So the question is, if we step back a little bit and we talk about, can we talk a little bit about what investments you're making to improve the business and what's high on your to-do list to help drive better performance as we move forward in investment management? Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThanks for the question, Glenn. I would say investment number one was Robin appointing Jose as the leader of that business, and he started last September.\nYou can see between the first quarter where we had a margin of 8% to this quarter where we're about 19%. You can see that step up in margin. You can see Jose is beginning to work the opportunity and making some decisions to right-size it from an efficiency standpoint. I'm very pleased with what Jose has done. What I also think he's doing very, very effectively, and look, both Robin and myself will have talked about this on prior quarters, the 1BNY approach in terms of desiloing the firm. You kind of have to go that extra mile as it relates to our investment and wealth management strategy and bringing the boutiques closer to the firm. I think Jose sees a lot of opportunity for us to cross-sell within the firm, both within our asset servicing business and within our Pershing business.\nSo bringing the strength of our manufacturing capabilities to our Pershing clients and our asset servicing clients is a kind of a key forward strategy that we can see we can do well at. And also bringing in leadership and product development. So I think you're going to see more positive stories coming from this particular segment. But as with all transformations, it takes a little bit of time, and Jose is getting that time to make the decisions that he needs to.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nAnd Glenn, let me just build on one particular point that Dermot just made. One of Jose's early observations about the business was we have a terrific, to use Dermot's term, manufacturing base. If you look under the hood of our $2.1 trillion of AUM, you have some real market-leading franchises. We have Insight, which is number one in its market.\nThat's a trillion dollars of it right there. You have Walter Scott, which is a terrific long-only, long-dated equity manager. You have a terrific business in the form of Dreyfus as money markets. And we have in Mellon a direct indexer that's capable of being able to create product that our asset servicing clients are very interested in. Obviously, it also has a lot of relevance for the $3 trillion of wealth distribution that we have in Pershing. So if you think about the manufacturing base, let's give ourselves a check that we have a pretty good set of businesses that are actually performing pretty well. On the distribution, if we didn't have BNY, then you could look at asset management, and you could say there are a lot of parallels with other mid-size to large asset managers, and the question of distribution would be on everybody's lips.\nBut one of Jose's observations was, \"Wow, this investment manager at BNY is one of the reasons why I joined BNY because there's all of this distribution potential, but we just haven't fully unlocked it.\" Okay. So then what sits in the middle? And that's the word that Dermot used, product, where if you take a metaphor for this for a second, imagine that you were a Coke or a Pepsi and you were making a beverage, and you had to concentrate, and you have all of this terrific distribution because you can sell in restaurants, you can sell in grocery stores, you can sell in a corner store as well. But in the middle of that is a critical point of product, which is, are you taking the manufacturing base that you have and making cans when you want to sell it in the corner store?\nBecause if you put bottles of concentrate in a corner store, it's not going to help you. But when you're delivering to a large fast food outlet, there you want to be able to deliver the concentrate. Cans are not as useful. So this piece in the middle, this product shaping that leverages the manufacturing base with an eye to the distribution channels that you have available to you is critical. And I think we haven't done as good a job on that as we could. And so that's a very big focus for us. And we think that when you take all of those things together, we think there's an interesting pathway here.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks for all that. Maybe I could do a tiny follow-up on the previous question.\nForgive me if you said it, but the fee revenue, we're up 5% for the first half, and the guide is still \"up\" on the year. Markets are higher. Despite this conversation we just had on investment management, it feels deliberately conservative, which I'm cool with. I'm just curious on how we square the up 5% for the first half. Markets are trending well. Your momentum's good. Why wouldn't the fee outlook be better? I know I asked you that last quarter, and you outperformed.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nSo the way I would answer it, it's like there are a lot of factors that go into the fee, a lot of external factors that we don't necessarily control, very market dependent. We kind of go back to the foundational building blocks of the platform operating model and the commercial model, which is still only a year old, but it is working.\nYou can see it. We have higher conviction about our ability to drive organic fee growth from here. We've changed a lot over the last three years, Glenn, about the transparency of our numbers and how we give you a lot more than we did three years ago. So I think as we get more conviction and as we get more kind of sales telemetry around us, we'll give you more guidance as we feel comfortable. But for now, I think the momentum is there. The upper trajectory is there, but we're not ready to yet guide on specifics around fees. And third quarter is usually a seasonally slower quarter, and Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter. So it's important to be balanced in that as well.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nFair enough. Thanks for all that.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nThanks, Glenn.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermot.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nGood morning, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI wanted to dig in a little bit on the AI commentary that you had, Robin. Starting off, the operating leverage is just so strong, almost double what consensus had baked in for you, and really terrific results here. I wanted to understand your comments on AI as it relates to the forward look because you indicated that nearly all your employees are using the Eliza AI Platform, and you're beginning to see the benefit of this. I mean, is it the benefit from AI at a level that we can see in these operating leverage results? And maybe you could help us understand, is this more revenues or expenses?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nSure. Well, thanks for your comments about positive operating leverage. As Dermot and I have both said over time, Betsy, that is a great North Star.\nGoing back to Glenn's question at the end there, one of the reasons why we've been always a little reluctant to guide on all of the elements underneath the hood of positive operating leverage is we recognize the composition, and any quarter or any year could be a little different. We don't want to create ceilings for ourselves. We are extremely hungry for positive operating leverage, and we see a ton of pathway. When you go under the hood, one of the reasons why over the past three years we've really focused on showing you all the inputs to what we're doing is because we recognize that the timing of exactly when each of these strategies starts to really hit varies a little bit. So we've got several things driving the positive operating leverage.\nWe've got a commercial engine which is starting to now make a meaningful contribution. Our output evidence, you can see it in the record sales quarters that we had in the first and second quarter. The Platform's Operating Model, we knew there would be a longer lead time to that. We started work on it three years ago, and now it's starting to come into its own, but it's still very early days because only less than 10% of our people have been in the model for at least a year. And as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we see the actual value really starting to shine through in Platform's Operating Model after we've had people in the model for about that period of time. So that is still to come, a little bit of it now, most of it 2026, 2027, 2028, and beyond.\nThe next layer is the heart of your question, which is AI. We view AI as a top-line story and an expense story because what we're really doing is we're unlocking capacity in the company. We want to then be able to use that capacity to do other higher-value things. That's why we've been encouraging all of our people to participate in AI because we view our AI solutions, which we put on page three, again, demonstrating the inputs today, and then we'll show you the outputs over time. We see those as being able to be very helpful, as too will be our digital employees as essentially companions and leverage for our people to be able to go faster and create capacity for themselves that they can reinvest in doing new things, pushing forward with clients, more time in the day, all of the above.\nSo our excitement about AI is a very medium- to long-term excitement, but we've invested heavily early on in the psychology of it in the company so that we have AI for everyone, everywhere, for everything. And that's really how we think about AI. So it's early days. There's not a ton in the P&L right now, to your point, with net investment, but we are starting to see the early signs of what we think will be an acceleration 26, 27, 28, 29, beyond.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. No good deed goes unpunished. I know you talked about organic growth.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nYou could make that one of your punchlines, Mike. I know you've trademarked the world's worst oligopoly, but that one you could put in trademark as well.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAnd BNY, not your parents' bank. Look, I'm the first to say you've optimized much better than I had expected these last two years. And you have these very high returns, but the organic growth, and you do it correctly, across markets, across currency, across deals, whether it's 2% or 3%, is still not great in the scheme of the overall world. And I know you want that growth to be better. And I know you said you had record sales, but the growth is still the growth. It hasn't changed that much at an organic level. And I know you guys have thought about this, but to the degree you sacrifice the very high returns to reinvest for better growth than what the companies had for the past five, 10, 20 years, right?\nWhere do you stand in that trade-off of maybe having lower returns or maybe not raising your return targets and reinvesting more for growth? Where should that organic growth be in your perfect world, the way you define it?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nSure. Several things here, Mike. One of the reasons why we put that chart in the top right corner of page three was to illustrate the fact that organic growth has been growing. I hear your point about three versus two, but three is still 50% more than two and significantly up from where it has been in the past. A few other points to note. Our growth in the past generally has been quite subject to markets. We are very happy to take advantage of constructive backdrops.\nAs I answered in a prior question, we're trying to position the company to take advantage of more types of backdrops so that we can be less handed our results by the market conditions and more in charge of our own destiny. That's a very deliberate strategy, and we feel like we're making some progress on that. That's sort of the next observation. The next thing under the hood is, what are the prerequisites for the real type of organic growth that you're talking about that you've challenged us on, understandably and rightly so, over the course of the past two or three years? This is where we really feel like we've set the table for the future. To your point about how we think about investing versus harvesting, we've been very clear on this.\nWe are taking a decade view of the transformation of BNY, and we're pleased where we are, close to three years in, but we are far from done because much of what we have done has actually been investing for the future, and we're in the very early stages of seeing that being harvested. We talked about the commercial model. We talked about the platform's operating model. We talked about AI, which is part of the growth story as well as it is on the expenses. But let me just come back to the key elements of what we've got. We've got a diversified set of platforms that is, yes, helping us to be more diversified in different environments, but it is also allowing us to better position to capitalize on these market trends and to generate alpha because it's less one business going to market by itself.\nIt's more, what's the synergy between the component parts? A client who custodies with us, who also does treasury clearing with us, who also does collateral management with us, is going to be able to get better outcomes over time because of the fact that all of those things can just be book entry for us within our ecosystem. That allows us to move to 24-hour. That allows us to think and embrace digital assets maybe in a different way than somebody else can. And you're starting to see the early signs of these platforms coming together to show something where the sum is more than the individual parts. And that's what our commercial model is actually about. So we're investing in these micro innovations, the bigger things, the synergies between the platforms. We've positioned people behind this. We've positioned culture behind this, and we're organizing the company behind this.\nAnd we think it is starting to show, but we absolutely agree with you that there should be a lot more gas in the tank here.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nHey, Mike, I would add just a couple of more points as well. One is you asked the question sometimes about negative pricing. We haven't seen it this quarter, which really kind of goes to the efficiency point about us being able to reduce our cost to serve, which is able to help us drive the organic growth because we're able to compete more effectively to win our share of business. So that would be point number one.\nPoint number two, to Robin's point about the commercial model, now we're in the early stages of a product model, which is joining with the commercial model, and that's been led by Carolyn Weinberg, where she's able to see in between the seams of our various businesses to create new products that clients want. So lots of opportunity to come there. The third point I would make is when you look at the firm overall, and you have to think about the enterprise, it's a 37% pre-tax margin, diversified business model. And so when you look at IWM, which is now hovering around the 19%, it's upside from here for the enterprise as we resume that path towards 25%, which is going to further fuel organic growth at the enterprise level.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nI guess just one more follow-up on the talk about acquisitions. And I heard you. It can be a powerful tool if it makes sense. You're not going to do anything stupid. I hear you. But as you broaden the art of what's possible, since you are talking about being a different type of not your parents' BNY because you are more diverse in terms of your offerings, what's the realm of possibilities for acquisition? Clearly, traditional trust businesses or sub-businesses are always possible going back to the merger, the big merger. But what other areas would you consider maybe buying?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nSo it's an important question, Mike. Again, our primary focus is on driving the growth, but there are really different pathways on this thing. So two or three years ago, we said there's absolutely no way that we're going to make any acquisitions. Then we sort of warmed up to the idea of capability buys, which is how I would frame Archer.\nAnd that really does check the box of helping us to go faster, to de-risk because we could buy versus having to build ourselves. And we're seeing the early signs of that output, great client feedback, the integration's been going well, and new client wins as a result of it. So I still think that that is the most likely path for us when it comes to M&A helping us to go faster. And I'm going to guess, but it doesn't have to be this way, that those types of things are generally more likely to be in the bits of the business which are a little bit more platform-like. Although it's interesting that Archer was a buy once, use across the firm type of acquisition. So that's our expectation for the primary focus because the bar for larger transactions is super high.\nWe'd have to have a lot of conviction in the execution of something like that because clearly they could be quite complicated. And there you could make a case elsewhere in some of the other segments that maybe there would be the opportunity to have even more scale. Because if you're a scale player and you've got a Platform's Operating Model-like organization, the thesis would be that you could bolt on more activity onto your existing chassis, and there would be a lot of scalability associated with that. So that's a fine thesis and something that we certainly keep in mind as well. But as now we have close to 2/3 of the company in platform-like businesses, either in MWS or in our issuer services business, and you look at MWS alone, it's a 49% margin.\nWe've got choices in this space, but we're not going to let those choices get distracting for us. We are focused on building our company, to your favorite term, the organic way, and then we'll just be opportunistic and disciplined on external-related stuff.\n\nMike Mayo",
    "content2": "Managing Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nMessage heard. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning for the question. Thank you. Busy morning. So I had a couple of questions for you guys around the new business opportunities. I know you mentioned a couple of things around the digital assets and just kind of tokenized environment, which obviously continues to be quite dynamic. I was hoping you could build on that a little more.\nObviously, there's a lot of debates in the financial services industry today, perhaps more so on this topic than in the past, in terms of what's a risk versus what's an opportunity. So when you think about where BNY sits in that realm, where do you see both risk to the existing businesses and some of the new revenue opportunities that could come out of this?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nSure. Thanks, Alex. Net-net, we see these advancements providing more opportunities than risks, but you're right. There are things on both sides of the ledger. If you just go back and just think about industries and big changes in technology that happen over time, they create disruption. And what disruption does is it allows for a little bit of a reorganization sometimes of the ecosystem.\nIt's our observation that companies that have a lot of forward-thinking innovation that push forward, that take advantage of that as opposed to sticking their heads in the sand, tend to be winners. Now, we have many specific valuable attributes that help us make us a great partner to these digital assets firms. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so engaged in this space for several years, because initially, it had been about providing our traditional banking services to those digital asset companies. We serve many of them with our traditional banking services. Then it's been about helping with the on-ramps, off-ramps between that traditional banking world and the on-chain world. And in the future, we think it's also going to be about more activity on-chain. We are live with Bitcoin custody today. We do it natively, and we can help clients.\nThere's more stuff in the world. We're in the business of looking after stuff as one of our businesses, and we're happy to do that. But we're also in the payments business. Again, there's synergy between our platforms. We're also in the issuer services corporate trustee business. There's synergy. We're in the NAV business. That's relevant. Synergy. Distribution business. Relevant. Money market fund business. Relevant. And so when you take all of these things together, we're a terrific partner for some of these clients because we can do a lot of different things with a trusted brand that actually helps them to feel good. So look, stablecoins particularly, it's obviously one of the topics of the day, and we're very active in that space. And that's the reason why we mentioned a couple of those recent examples, but there are many more in our prepared remarks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nBut Alex, what I would say is don't lose also that's all great stuff, but don't lose sight of our core businesses that are market-leading, that are growing share because the market is growing. So growing the pie with existing clients in our core businesses is also happening and very important.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYep. That's all very fair. Dermot, one for you on just the balance sheet dynamic and deposits. I know you mentioned you guys don't lead with deposits. That all makes sense. But when we look at the trajectory for the deposit base over the last couple of quarters, obviously much more stable and nice to see the non-interest bearing deposits improving here as well. So as you look out into the back half and ultimately where we are in July, maybe give us a sense where non-interest deposits in particular sit.\nAs we think about the forward, which businesses tend to drive those for you guys as we sort of think about the trajectory beyond 2025?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nSo it was a strong quarter. I expect the balances to moderate into Q3. You might remember Q3 of last year was a strong quarter for us in terms of NII. So Q3 is a tough comp, and deposits we expect to moderate the seasonal slowdown. The diversity of the NII across the franchise is particularly pleasing, but corporate trust is a highlight. Because of the breadth, the depth, and the market shares that we have in that business, we do attract a lot of cash into the system by virtue of increased client activity. So corporate trust in Q2 was a notable highlight, particularly around escrows as a result of increased M&A activity.\nBut I would expect that to moderate a little bit in Q3 and pick up again in Q4. But overall, I feel pretty convicted around the high mid-single digits NII growth for the year.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll righty. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you'd like to join the Q&A, press star one on your telephone keypad now. We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe two separate questions on the platform's operating model. So first one, maybe for you, Dermot, focusing on the cost reduction element as we have another 50% to migrate over the next, call it, 12 months. And I know, obviously, expense guidance went up a little bit, which makes complete sense given the stronger revenue growth environment and also the dynamic budgeting aspect that you've talked about.\nBut on the cost reduction side from that conversion on the platform's operating model, how should we think about framing that as a positive contributor to the expense story for the rest of this year in 2026?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nSo I do go back to a little bit, Brian, what Robin said earlier about 50% of the people are in the model. We've done three waves over the last 15 months. The maturity level between wave one and wave three is quite stark. And what the wave one businesses that went into the model are doing now in terms of 1BNY connectivity, automation, dynamic innovation, having an entrepreneurial spirit within their own businesses, it gives me a great sense of pride to actually see it day in, day out.\nWhile your question led with the cost reduction, we really think about it internally, about running the company better and creating capacity. We either deploy that capacity into new investments, new opportunities, or we let it flow through to positive operating leverage. You can see in Q2 of this year, we kind of gave the market 500 basis points of positive operating leverage, and the platform operating model was a contributor to that. So with 50% of the firm in the model and 10% in about 15 months, I would expect the maturity of this to kind of give us a benefit for the next few years. It's not for another two years where I would say the firm will be reasonably mature in the model, and it's creating its own flywheel of momentum and innovation.\nWhen you overlay that with the maturity of the commercial model and you overlay that again with what Carolyn is doing on the product side, you're going to see the North Star of positive operating leverage be delivered for the foreseeable future. So it's all about running the company better, and I don't talk internally about expenses or cost reduction.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Okay. That's great. Then maybe just also on a following question on the platform's operating model, as you think about M&A, maybe just your thoughts around how much the operating model, the platform's operating model, kind of informs your decision about what type of M&A to do. Is it a major or a primary factor in bringing on businesses that you think can fit into that model and therefore you can scale them in organically?\nAnd then I guess, is it even possible to do large-scale M&A and integrate that into this platform, or do you see too many disparities with other large providers that would make that difficult?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nYeah. It's an important question. So look, broadly on the Platform's Operating Model, Dermot touched on the fact that it's a two-sided thing because we're very much looking for it to drive revenue. This interlock between Platform's Operating Model and the Commercial Model is super important because by having defined our products and client platforms in the way that we have, and then by layering over that a new go-to-market approach with our Commercial Model, that's just allowing us to go faster, collaborate more across the platforms, create more solutions, and really create a lot of empowerment to our teams to go and listen to clients, invent new stuff, provide more solutions to them.\nAnd of course, that and just running the company better more broadly, as Dermot mentioned, those are the reasons why we are doing this. Now, it has a nice byproduct, which is it organizes ourselves in a way where our chassis is super well-organized and very strong. And we clearly see the benefits of that across the board as we continue to go through the model. And so I think what that will result in is when we talk about some type of bolt-on acquisition, and almost irrespective of its size, if it's sort of adding to us in something that we broadly do today or something that essentially speeds us forward in something that we do today, we're able to add it without having to take on all of the expenses associated with us because it sort of becomes a bolt-on to a chassis that we have.\nYou could see that with Archer as a good example, which is they are able to do more of what they want to do because they're able to tap into the right additional parts of BNY. The client onboarding capabilities that our client onboarding platform provides to Archer in its acquisition of new clients allows them to go faster. The fact that we've been able to wrap our technology and our AI around that is going to allow them to do more things. And so there's a real economy you're able to actually achieve an economy of scale, and actually add scale to a scale business or go faster in a business where you're adding a capability, whereas sometimes that's a theoretical conversation because you look at something and you say, \"Oh, well, you could just you're pretty scaled.\nYou could just add more stuff and it'll scale.\" But that's not true if you're adding a complicated back end and you're trying to smash two incompatible things together. And I think that was a lesson that this company learned 20 years ago with the acquisition or the merger between Mellon and BNY. That was not consolidated properly. So the punchline is the platform's operating model allows us to have a clarity of chassis that I think actually will allow for higher quality integrations in the future if ever we choose to do one.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. That's great color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nVP and Banks Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning. So you're pretty clear that you see further upside on returns and margin from here, even with the strong results you've had in this quarter and the first half.\nAre there areas right now that you feel like you're over-earning, or would you say that you're looking to hold or improve profitability across the firm from these levels right now?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nI would say it's a good question, David. How I would answer that is we're trying to get better every day in every business. A mindset I adopt with everybody that I work with and talk to is 1% improvement every day. Be better. Run the company better. Always be humble. It's all about the client. If you keep the client happy, you're going to win more business. That really is, I think, our secret sauce.\nI talked to a couple of people this week who've been at the firm for a long time, and I said, \"What's the difference between BNY today and BNY of 10 years ago?\" In a word, it was about client centricity. So we're very focused on putting the client at the heart of everything that we do. So I wouldn't say that any one business we feel like we've reached max potential because we've invested in a lot. If you kind of take corporate trust two or three years ago, that was a high-performing business from a margin standpoint, but had been neglected for a long time with respect to investment because the margin was good. But now we've kind of decided to invest in the business, and we're growing share. We're doing it at a higher margin than we did before. We're using AI.\nWe have better employee NPS scores. So all in around, the strategy is working when you look at the three strategic pillars for that particular business. If you looked at it objectively three years ago, you would say nothing to do there. And we felt like there was a lot to do, and we're making great progress.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nDavid, let me add a couple of things because your question is one of these things that we debate quite a bit internally as a team, and it goes back actually to the very earliest days of us re-underwriting our strategy. At the time, you might remember us saying this, we looked back over the industry, for instance, on annual operating leverage, and we say, \"What does great look like?\nWhat are the two best performers in the prior decade from 2012 to 2022 on positive operating leverage, and what actually is that number?\" And the answer was, \"Well, it was 150 basis points of positive operating leverage on average over the course of that decade.\" So we said, \"Okay. Well, we think we can be best in class. We think we've got the businesses to do it. Let's shoot for that.\" And lo and behold, we've sort of blown that out of the water in 2023 and 2024 and also in the first half of 2025. So it begs the question to ourselves about, \"Are we over-earning? How does the environment fit into this?\" And then we realized, of course, well, we keep talking about being a platform's operating company. We have these great set of businesses. We don't actually think that banks are our pure comp.\nWe think that there's also a comp out there with other platforms companies and other financial services platforms companies who don't happen to exist in bank form. And so when you start to look at the world through those lenses, suddenly ROTCE, you can see a pathway to bigger numbers, and you can see a pathway to bigger numbers on margin. And we look at those types of comps, and we say, \"Okay. Let us not be satisfied with what we originally thought of as maybe the way that we think about positive operating leverage. It's okay to push harder.\" Having said that, we constantly want to be able to invest. And so to Dermot's point, we're not going to let a pursuit of positive operating leverage cause us somehow to under-invest in the business. We are investing with a decade view first and foremost.\nBut I think it does go to one of the earlier questions and your point also about, \"Are there ceilings?\" So I'm sure there will be, but we're not allowing ourselves, including not being lulled into a sense of security by achieving our medium-term outlooks and targets, we're not allowing ourselves to think about any ceilings across the business.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nVP and Banks Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nSo just to push you a little bit on that, if you're not putting any ceilings or capping yourself on expenses in order to achieve positive operating leverage, why not invest a little bit more than just 3% expense growth given the strong backdrop you're seeing and strong performance you've shown so far the first half?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nNo, it's a good push, and we do challenge ourselves on that question.\nI think if you were in our sort of weekly syncs on these types of topics internally, you'd hear Dermot on a regular basis going out to the various different businesses and platforms and say, Tell me what you need to invest. Do you need more investment and more expense allocation in order to be able to help you to go faster? And so that is a constant push that we are giving to the businesses. Now, having said that, we are mindful of the fact that some of what we do is also dictated by the environment, maybe less and less over time, but it clearly is still a meaningful backdrop for us.\nAnd so we are naturally a little bit conservative in terms of how we think about the year going into it because if, for instance, we'd had a much, much tougher backdrop, which would not have been impossible in the quarter when you think about what was happening in April and all of the sort of uncertainties that were in April, we wouldn't have felt comfortable necessarily if we'd had a more negative environment growing our expense guide. So there's a certain amount of agility as opposed to going into the year assuming everything's going to be perfect, betting on a big expense number, and then getting disappointed. That's the old version of BNY Mellon. That's not the BNY of today.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nFinancial discipline is a very important skill and muscle memory that we've developed over the last few years, and we'd like to think that you have given us some credibility for that. It's not our desire to lose that. Financial discipline is very important to us.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nVP and Banks Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nThanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Your line is now open.\n\nRajiv Bhatia\n\nEquity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGreat. Good morning. Yeah. Just want to follow up on your remark that you're not seeing negative pricing. Should I interpret that as pricing being flat year over year? And is that on a consolidated basis? Are you seeing the pricing environment differ by LOB?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nIt's broadly flat across the firm and significantly improved from three years ago where I would say it was a headwind a few years ago.\nI think as a result of all the strategies and the initiatives that we talked to you about and that we've talked about today, I would say repricing, if I was to give you a stat, is roughly down about 80% from where it was three years ago. So overall, at the enterprise level, it's flat to slightly positive this year so far. And does it differ by LOB? Not really. No. There's no standout really by LOB. I would say it's broadly consistent.\n\nRajiv Bhatia\n\nEquity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nCEO, BNY\n\nThank you, Operator. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well and enjoy the rest of the summer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2:00PM Eastern Time today. Have a great day."

I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Robin Vince, our President.\nAnd Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer.\nAs always, we will reference our quarterly.\nUpdate presentation which can be found on.\nThe Investor Relations page of our website at BNY.com.\nI note that our remarks will contain.\nForward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.\nActual results may differ materially from those.\nProjected in the forward-looking statements.\nInformation about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the Earnings Press Release, Financial Supplement, and Quarterly Update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 11 April 2025, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start with a few broader comments before Dermot takes you through the financial results for the quarter. Reflecting on the operating environment. While there were clear signs of optimism at the beginning of the year, we have now seen a rapid and significant reversal of sentiment driven by uncertainty about trade and fiscal policies, which added to existing tail risks, including a variety of geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Last week's tariff announcements were clearly part of a broader strategy and an effort to reset trade relations between the US and the rest of the world. This is an attempt at a very fundamental change.\nWhile last week's announcements provided an initial baseline, we should expect that negotiations will take time, and it is likely that a clear final picture won't be reached for a while, a view re-emphasized by Wednesday's news on a three-month pause and the market volatility we saw again yesterday. The read-through of this uncertainty into both capital markets and the real economy creates elevated risks in the near and medium term. In times like this, being positioned conservatively with balance sheet strength and operational resilience allows us to remain focused on serving our clients and continuing to execute on the ongoing transformation of BNY into a more platform-oriented company.\nTurning to the quarter and referring to page 2 of the quarterly update presentation, we delivered a very solid financial performance in the first quarter. Earnings per share of $1.58 were up 26% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 22% excluding notable items. Total revenue of $4.8 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Expenses around the company remained well controlled, up 2% year-over-year. Taken together, we delivered another quarter of meaningful positive operating leverage, 346 basis points on a reported basis and 261 basis points excluding notable items. Our pre-tax margin improved to 32% and our return on tangible common equity improved to 24%.\nAs I've noted before, BNY plays a central role in global markets, powering our clients with platforms across custody, security, settlement, collateral, payments, trading, wealth, investments, and more in over 100 markets around the world. Notwithstanding the current environment, we continue to see a meaningful opportunity from our work to better align ourselves as an integrated financial services platforms company. Our transformation strategy includes both a new commercial coverage approach and our strategic platforms operating model which together are designed to enhance the client experience and enable greater agility. The execution of this strategy is a significant exercise in change management which requires hard work and takes time, but our teams around the world have embraced the opportunity and we are making progress.\nThis past quarter marked the first anniversary since we started the phased transition into our new operating model, and just one year in, we have more than half of BNY working in this new way. Already. We are starting to see how this transformation can drive top line growth with greater scalability. For instance, over the past year our trade finance team is processing trade loans 60% faster. Our enterprise onboarding team is also working faster while seeing a more than 30% increase in onboarding volume. Our payments team has tripled the number of currencies we offer our bank clients to support consumer activity.\nComplementing our platform work and building on the momentum with which we entered the year, our new commercial coverage model is proving increasingly effective in enabling more integrated client solutions from across the entire company. The first three months of the year represented our strongest sales quarter on record. The number of clients who bought from three or more lines of business has increased by 40% over the past two years, and we continued to see outsized sales growth with those multi-line of business clients. In just one example, a large privately held multinational company where BNY has acted as custodian for the pension plan and corporate cash portfolio, where we provide corporate trust and debt capital market services, and we provide wealth management to the company's senior executives.\nWe recently expanded our relationship to also include supporting the company's collateral needs and managing short-term cash through our Liquidity Direct platform. As I've said before, effectively cross-selling the breadth of our platforms in this way and at scale represents the single most compelling growth opportunity for our company. As an institution with a long history of innovation, we have not forgotten that delivering new solutions is another important way for us to be more for our clients and to drive top-line growth. We recently welcomed Carolyn Weinberg to the company as a member of the Executive Committee. She is now our Chief Product and Innovation Officer. Many people across our organization are focused on innovating new capabilities. Instant payments, Digital assets, Wealth tech, Private markets, Collateral liquidity, all examples of domains where we are innovating.\nThe addition of Carolyn in this new role will increase our leadership bandwidth to drive innovative new commercial opportunities and find new ways to leverage our platforms and data and for client solutions.\nWhile on the topic of innovation, I also want to take a moment to specifically call out the opportunity we see from AI. At BNY, we've been taking a platform-based approach to AI capabilities, building and deploying solutions at scale with resilient, responsible guardrails throughout. We believe that our AI platform is going to be an important advantage for us, and as a large language model-agnostic design leveraging frontier models from multiple leading providers. To that end, in the first quarter we announced a multi-year agreement with OpenAI giving BNY access to cutting-edge tools and working with OpenAI to advance AI use cases in financial services. Over 80% of our employees have completed the prerequisite training to access Eliza, our AI platform, and more than 8,000 of them are already experimenting with personal AI agents, honing the skills they need to use AI effectively.\nTo date, we have deployed more than 40 AI solutions into production with a significant additional number at various stages of building and testing. Collectively, we expect these to drive productivity gains, improved risk management, and to provide meaningful leverage to our people in the future. We strongly believe that by empowering our people with AI to do what we do better every day, we will harness great benefits over the coming years. Before I hand the call over to Dermot, I want to close where I began. While the outlook for the operating environment has become more uncertain, we are prepared for a wide range of macroeconomic and market scenarios.\nOur ongoing work to operate BNY as a more platforms oriented company, combined with our highly capitalized, liquid and lower credit risk balance sheet positions us to manage dynamically and act as a source of strength as we support our clients in navigating the current environment. I'd like to thank our people around the world for bringing intensity and excellence to drive us forward as one BNY. With that, over to you Don.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning everyone. I'm starting with our consolidated financial results for the quarter on Page three of the presentation.\nTotal revenue of $4.8 billion was up 6% year-over-year, and excluding notable items, total revenue was up 5%. Fee revenue was up 3%. That included 6% growth in investment services fees in our security services and market and wealth services segments driven by net new business and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were down 5%, driven by the mix of AUM flows and an adjustment for certain rebates partially offset by higher market values.\nWhile not on the page, I will note that firm-wide AUCA of $53.1 trillion were up 9% year-over-year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values, and net new business.\nAssets under management of $2 trillion were flat year-over-year as higher market values were offset by cumulative net outflows.\nForeign exchange revenue was up 3% year-over-year, driven by higher spreads on the back of higher volatility.\nInvestment and other revenue was $230 million, which included a $40 million disposal gain. A notable item in the quarter.\nNet Interest Income was up 11% year-over-year, driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, partially offset by changes in deposit mix.\nProvision for credit losses was $18 million in the quarter, reflecting reserve increases relating to commercial real estate. Exposure.\nExpenses of $3.3 billion were up 2% year-over-year, driven by higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.58 on both a reported and on an operating basis, excluding the impact of notable items. Earnings per share were up 22% year-over-year.\nOur pre-tax margin was 32% and our return on tangible common equity was 24% in the quarter.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on page four.\nOur Tier one Leverage Ratio for the quarter was 6.2%. The sequential increase reflects capital generated through earnings from preferred stock issuance and improved Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income partially offset by capital distributed through common stock repurchases and dividends.\nOur CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.5%.\nThe sequential increase reflects the aforementioned increase in capital partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets.\nOver the course of Q1, we returned approximately $1.1 billion of capital to our common shareholders, representing a 95% total payout ratio year to date.\nWith regards to liquidity, the consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 116% and the consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio was 132%.\nNext, Net Interest Income and balance sheet trends on page five.\nNet interest income of $1.2 billion was up 11% year-over-year and down 3% quarter over quarter. The sequential decrease reflects changes in balance sheet size and mix partially offset by the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields.\nAverage interest earning assets decreased by 1% sequentially, including lower cash and reverse repo balances partially offset by higher investment securities and loan balances.\nAverage deposit balances also decreased by 1% sequentially, reflecting lower non-interest-bearing balances. Compared to the seasonally strong fourth quarter.\nAverage interest-bearing deposit balances remained flat.\nTurning to our business segments. Starting on page six.\nSecurity services reported total revenue of $2.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 4% year-over-year. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, reflecting higher market values and a net new business. In issuer services, investment services fees were up 2%, driven by net new business in corporate trust.\nIn this segment.\nForeign exchange revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by higher spreads on the back of higher volatility. Investment in other revenue of $140 million in the quarter included the $40 million disposal gain that I mentioned earlier.\nNet interest income for the segment was up 8% year-over-year.\nSegment expenses of $1.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year driven by higher investments, revenue-related expenses, and employee merit increases partially offset by efficiency savings.\nSecurities Services reported pre-tax income of $708 million, up 20% year-over-year, and a pre-tax margin of 31%.\nOnto Market and Wealth Services on page seven.\nIn our Markets and Wealth Services segment, we reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year.\nTotal investment services fees were up 8% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 4% driven by higher market values and net new business.\nNet new assets were $11 billion in the quarter, and we started off the year with a meaningful renewal from Cambridge Investment Research, a long-time client and a growing independent firm.\nIn clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 10%, driven by broad-based growth in clearance volumes and collateral balances, and in treasury services, investment services fees were up 14%, driven by net new business.\nNet interest income for the segment overall was up 17% year-over-year.\nSegment expenses of $866 million were up 4% year-over-year driven by higher investments and employee merit increases partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Markets and Wealth Services segments reported pre-tax income of $816 million, up 20% year-over-year and a pre-tax margin of 48%.\nTurning to investment and wealth management on page eight.\nOur investment and wealth management segment reported total revenue of $779 million, down 8% year-over-year.\nInvestment management fees were down 4% year-over-year driven by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates partially offset by higher market values.\nSegment expenses of $714 million were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower revenue-related expenses and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher investments.\nInvestment and Wealth Management reported pre-tax income of $63 million, down 41% year-over-year, and a pre-tax margin of 8%.\nAs I described earlier, Assets Under Management of $2 trillion were flat year-over-year. In Q1 we saw $18 billion of net outflows driven by index, cash equity, and multi asset strategies, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income, and LDI strategies.\nWealth Management client assets of $327 billion increased by 6% year-over-year driven by higher market values and cumulative net inflows.\nPage nine shows the results of the other segment.\nI'll just note that in this segment the sequential improvement in both revenue and expenses reflects the absence of net losses on sales of securities recorded in the Q4 as well as lower severance expense in the Q1.\nI'll close with a few comments on the financial guidance for 2025 that we provided on our earnings call in January.\nWhile it is clear that the outlook for the operating environment has become more uncertain, our financial guidance and with it our determination to drive positive operating leverage in a wide range of scenarios remains unchanged. That means we continue to expect full year 2025 NII to be up mid-single-digit percentage points year-over-year.\nWe continue to expect some fee revenue growth, of course market-dependent, and we continue to expect approximately 1% to 2% year-over-year growth in expenses, excluding notable items.\nWe also continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the 22% to 23% range. Considering our 20% tax rate in Q1, that means approximately 23% to 24% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year.\nWe continue to expect to return approximately 100% ± of 2025 earnings over the course of the year. I'll repeat what I said in January. We continuously manage the pace of our buybacks considering macroeconomic and interest rate environments, balance sheet growth, and many other factors with a conservative bias. To wrap up, BNY posted another set of solid results in Q1, which demonstrate our consistent execution and delivery on the back of our strong balance sheet. We are focused on supporting our clients in navigating the cross currents of this uncertain operating environment, all the while continuing to drive at unlocking the opportunity embedded in our company. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up question, and our first question will come from Ken Houston with Autonomous Research.\n\nKen Houston\n\nCo-head of the Autonomous US Business and Lead Banking Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey Robin, Dermot, good morning.\nYou know, another really good quarter in.\nterms of the NII generation and deposit growth. I know you guys have talked about how deposit stability is important to NII generation. I know it's early in the year and we have all this uncertainty, obviously a better start than the run rate guide would imply. But just wondering, just what do you think about just the world of deposits? Do you see any benefits in an uncertain world in terms of flows like to safety and just how we should think about some of the moving parts going forward. Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks for the question. Look, Q1 as it relates to deposits was right in line with our expectations in terms of balance and mix shift. Q4 is seasonally strong quarter for us as it relates to overall balances, so we saw some of that moderate in Q1. Now, with the elevated uncertainty and volatility in the markets over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a little pickup in deposits overall, but not in a meaningful way that we would have say so we would have seen two years ago in the regional bank crisis. So we haven't yet seen that kind of port in the storm flight quality, but you know, people know the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of our liquidity and capital.\nSo we have seen a little bit of a tick up, but not in a way that we saw two years ago.\n\nKen Houston\n\nCo-head of the Autonomous US Business and Lead Banking Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. So we'll just see if that holds up and go from there. Just bigger picture about just the environment we're in. You have a lot of different businesses, and this is the type of environment where we see a lot of activity potential, I guess. And it was notable to see FX a little softer. But I'm just wondering how we, how do you guys see this world in terms of just businesses that either get more active or potentially less active based on how clients act, and where you expect to see kind of money flows as you could think about how past cycles would be inference to this one. Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah, Ken, I'll take that one. So I think it's fair to see the phases of these types of events sort of split into two. So there's one which tends to be a little bit more frenzied activity in the marketplace. That's what we've been seeing over the course of the past 10 days or so in terms of activity. And so that does give rise to higher volumes. And we're seeing that across our platforms for sure. Now we're not a huge trading firm like some others out there, but we see it in terms of high counts on clearing volumes, in terms of activity on liquidity platforms, collateral activity, and all the places where you'd expect it to be, where we're really capturing the fact that market volumes are up.\nTo Dermot's point earlier on about liquidity, the reason why we probably haven't seen a big flight into us at this point is because a lot of the activity has been delevering by people who've been raising cash to pay back lines, not raising cash just to have more dry powder on the sidelines. It hasn't yet been as much long-only liquidation, which tends to raise cash. And that cash often ends up on our balance sheet. So it's sort of a little bit of a phasing thing. And then, what can happen. And we'll have to see if that does happen. But as things calm down at some point, it causes CEOs and leadership teams to reflect on how do they want to think about the strategic consequences for their business.\nAnd that's where our rentable scale, our platforms, and the fact that we have all of these broad capabilities built on this sort of rock-solid foundation, that's what allows us to then capture potential follow-on opportunities where people say, you know what, there are things I used to do for myself that I'd now rather someone like BNY does for me using their platforms. And so that's how I think about the world right now.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nAnd Ken, just to clarify, you mentioned softness in FX is up 3% year-over-year. We're kind of, you know, the numbers we present there are the firm-wide numbers. When you kind of go underneath the hood on that and talk specifically about our market markets business, that was a solid year-over-year uptake. Whereas on the other side, our corporate treasury department are doing FX placements. And the other side of that is reflected in NII. So you're seeing a firm-wide view there as opposed to a specific markets view. And the market view for us year.\nYear-over-year was solid.\n\nKen Houston\n\nCo-head of the Autonomous US Business and Lead Banking Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you for the question as well. Maybe starting with a bit of a strategic question, also just kind of thinking about the position of the bank. Obviously, very strong capital base, lots of liquidity at times of uncertainty and dislocation. There might be some interesting inorganic opportunities that may come up time and again. How are you thinking about that? Maybe it's too early, but just want to get your sense for appetite for M&A if something compelling comes along, and if there are areas of particular interest where inorganic growth might make sense.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYes, thanks, Alex. Look, we're carefully looking at the opportunities. That's not a spot, moment-in-time thing. It's just a sort of the rhythm as this management team has been driving through things over the course of the past two and a half years. We think we've got a lot of things under control in terms of running the company better. You can see us driving now on the sales side, you can see us driving the execution platforms. You can see the innovation. And so we're always going to be out there thinking about what could be added additive to our platform. We just think it's the responsible thing to do for shareholders. Now we're going to. What hasn't changed is maintaining great discipline and an acquisition. We need to check all of the boxes of like, clear alignment with our priorities, strong cultural fit.\nAnd I underline that because that is important to us and attractive financial returns, obviously. But you're right, you know, times like this can present opportunities and we'll be thoughtful about it. And I feel that we, we've practiced some of this with our Archer acquisition. That wasn't huge, but nonetheless it was a sort of a small to medium-sized thing. It was a capabilities buy, but we're going through all of the training processes internally to understand how to look at and then purchase and then integrate something like that in a first-class way. And then the final thing I'll say is platform's operating model is quite additive to our capability over time to be able to, I think, be a better integrator because it creates the roadmap for us internally on how to take things and plug them in better.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGotcha, thanks. And then my follow up is actually double clicking to your earlier response to Ken's question around deposits. So up a little, not a ton so far in April. Can you comment also on the mix between interest bearing and non-interest bearing in April? And then ultimately as you sort of think about a more normalized percentage of non-interest bearing deposits, you guys are at 17% I think now even pre-COVID. So kind of before the spike in industry-wide liquidity, you guys were running north of 20. How do you think about that sort of run rate mix going forward in more uncertain environment? And if in fact you enter into a recession, what would that look like? Likely look like?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo, I guess there were a lot of questions in that follow-up question, Alex. But.\nTo think about the NII for a second and the reconfirmation of the guide of 5%, which we feel pretty good about. I think it goes back to something that we discussed on previous calls, which is that very, very strong joined-up partnership between the CIO, the Treasurer, and our Deposit Desk. A lot of the work that drives our confidence around NII for this year are the actions that we took last summer over, after Jackson Hole, where we kind of immunized the firm for 2025 NII. So a lot of work on the asset side in terms of NIBs as it relates to like as rates have trended higher, you would expect a reasonable amount of cash sorting to go on and people optimize for yield. We don't lead with deposits.\nClients come to us to do other activities in the firm, and with that comes deposits, which can then turn into operational deposits. So, in terms of the overall guide of like the 281 number, which we have seen tick up a little bit this quarter, and it is a seasonal business. Q4 is our strongest quarter for deposits typically, then Q1 is a little bit less than that. Q3 is our seasonal low. So, there's nothing that we see kind of changing our view of the overall deposit mix for the balance of the year, which kind of gives us a lot of confidence around the guide that we gave you.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nAll right, thank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, I guess my first question is, no good deed goes unpunished. So I do note your revenues are up 5% year-over-year and your headcount's down 2%.\nBut.\nSo you raised the bar for yourself. But did note that the non-comp expenses are growing mid-single digits year-over-year. I'm wondering how much that might continue. And also the impact on revenues from the decline of non-interest-bearing deposits, is that seasonal or is that something that's just a result of the macro environment? Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo look Mike, I think our ability to deliver positive operating leverage through the cycle is the North Star. I think this is the fifth quarter that we've delivered consistent positive operating leverage. Hopefully you are beginning to give us credit for being a financially disciplined, well-run company where we have got our expenses under control over the last couple of years while at the same time making investments in the strategies that are powering our top line growth, and our efficiency growth. So you're beginning to see those investments paying off. I'm pleased that you highlighted the headcount number, which just generally means that we're able to do more with less in a digitally empowered way. As Robin mentioned in his prepared remarks, we still haven't really unlocked the power of AI.\nSo when you think about where AI is going to be on our platform as a financial platform company, where you see 20% of the world's investable assets flowing through our pipeline, when we kind of get the AI strategy integrated into the strategy of the firm, we see a lot of dividends coming in that.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAnd then you didn't answer the non-interest-bearing deposit question, which might not be answerable, but any thoughts there?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo look, non-interest-bearing deposits, I think, you know, are roughly in line with where we don't really expect them to go meaningfully higher or meaningfully lower from where they are now. Which reinforces our guide, like, so NII is made up of what we've done on the asset side and what we think the forecast is going to be in terms of the mix and the overall level of the deposits at the end of the year. We ran about 35 different scenarios. We did the same thing at Q1. We feel we've kind of cut the tails off the risk of what we believe the reasonable outcome of NII is going to be. And to give you a little bit of an indication, like, up, down. If the Fed were to cut rates by 50 basis points tomorrow, it wouldn't really impact how we think about NII.\nFor the balance of the year.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThat's great. My second question is for Robin. I saw you on CNBC and you talked about the hard data is good, but the soft data is bad and they'll converge one way or another. I guess it's unanswerable also, but how long can this go on before, you know, things tip like the hard data goes to soft data, soft data goes back to hard data. Do we have one month as a country and economy? One month, three months, six months, 12 months? Kind of. What's, what's your sense there and what is the risk of being an international company and being a services company and potential retaliation there? I don't know how you think or frame that, but I'll take any thoughts you have. Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSure. I love that you ask unanswerable questions, but nonetheless, I'll give them both a whirl. Okay, so first of all, yeah, this point about and we saw it again today with the confidence taking a little bit of another beating in the survey data that was released this morning. It is, it's going down and it's not surprising because if you're a CEO, you've got an uncertain environment potentially out over the horizon. It doesn't help you thinking about longer term commitments, including building factories, including making, making commitments to sort of new initiatives or whatever the case may be. And if you're a consumer, the fear of our prices going to go up, what's it going to mean? Obviously there's also a jobs angle on all of this as well. Could the economy tip into a recession? Those are all legit questions that a consumer would have.\nThat's going to be a little bit of a dampener of confidence. So I think there are plenty of reasons to think that that will continue to be low. My point when I talked about this before was that the two things at some point just have to converge. The longer that it goes on, the greater the probability that the facts converge down to the sentiment as opposed to if for some reason we suddenly had clarity and we suddenly had a sense of confidence being able to come back, then it would converge back up to the facts and we'd be in a better space. But I think with a 90-day pause on tariffs and then.\nProbably a fairly long tail on full emergence of a clear picture. I think you have to be a little bit pessimistic here about how the economy is going to evolve over the course of the next six to nine months. I'd love to be wrong on that one, but I think as every day goes by, let's call it, this trade has negative carry.\nTo be able to hold. So we'll see. On the second question that you asked internationally, we are a global firm. 40% of our revenues come from outside of the US, but we're also a firm that provides really critical services to our clients. And so clients always have choices, and we have to earn their business every single day with how we behave and how our platforms operate. But it is this combination of having this reputation of being trusted, having this rock solid underpinning which, as you know, creates this port in a storm capability. Plus the fact that we do things that are really important. You know, clearing Treasuries for most people is not an optional activity.\nHaving access to a global collateral platform that lets your business operate more effectively, maintaining your access to the rails of the financial system, those are very, very core, significant things. So, you know, I'd like to think the combination of the trust, the reputation, and then the day-to-day operation will cause, will cause our clients to continue to see value with us. But obviously that's something that we'll have to see, how it evolves.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMoving on to Ebrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nHead Managing Director of American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, Good morning.\nI guess maybe Robin, just to that last point, Dermot and Robin, you mentioned the clearing of Treasuries. You have a very deep sort of understanding of the market infrastructure. There's obviously concerns around the treasury market, what's happening, whether the Fed needs to intervene. Just give us sort of a preview into what you've seen over the last few days. Are things working as smoothly as you would expect and what the risk looks like there, or the need for a Fed intervention.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSure. So look, I would separate the Treasury market into a couple of different pieces. The rails of the system are working really well. We're seeing high volumes, yes, for sure, but everything's functioning really well. And we have, as you point out, a very good view into that. There was a little bit of a tail in the three-year auction, of course, as was well publicized earlier in the week, but then we had a very solid 10-year auction and long bond auction as well. But what has evolved, and this is not unique to Treasuries in any way, we've seen it in equities as well, is that the depth at the top of the order book has reduced. And so bid-offer spreads have widened. The amount of risk that can be moved at the top of the book is much smaller.\nYou have to go deeper into the book to be able to move blocks of risk. And that is true in the treasury market as it's been true in equity markets. And we've seen all the things that you'd normally expect, is a little bit of dislocation with ETF NAVs versus the underliers. Those types of things are all indicative of people trying to move blocks of risk. And there's a bit of a consequence to it in terms of liquidity. You know, the Fed will have to make their own decisions about how they think about things. But if you look at history, what history suggests is that they intervene when they see markets that become fundamentally dysfunctional or dislocated where it's not possible to move risk and the markets really aren't functioning properly. And that's absolutely not what we have seen this week. Markets are working fine.\nWe're just seeing situations where liquidity is reduced and therefore people are having to pay up. I think that's the distinction that I'd make for you.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nHead Managing Director of American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. I guess a separate question.\nMaybe not timely given all the macro concerns, but your global head of digital assets testified in front of Congress with regards to the stablecoin legislation. That's a huge priority for this administration. Just give us a sense of how we should think about what is stablecoin legislation. BNY had relationships with Circle, I think going back a few years ago, what all of that means in terms of your ability to play in digital assets. Are there meaningful implications on revenue growth deposits that we should be thinking about?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nI think the short answer is we don't see it as a near-term big revenue item on the list, but we've always seen digital assets as a long-term play, whether it's the creation of new stuff or new packages of stuff. Look, we're in the business of looking after things in one of our platforms. That's our custody business. $53 trillion world number one. And so if there's going to be new stuff in the world, we want to be able to look after it. But then more broadly the tokenization and leveraging the technology to find better ways of being able to move assets through the system more efficiently, less cost, less infrastructure required to do it. We actually think those will be a net plus net net over time for us.\nAnd so our strategy has been pretty simple, which is we've been very engaged with all of the participants in the system. You mentioned Congress and the regulators, but it's true with the clients as well. We provide a lot of our traditional rails to these new players, and that's been a great way to build relationship. You mentioned one particular client that we do exactly that for. Now I think it's very positive that Congress is looking at this question because stablecoins, or some form of digital currency on chain, is necessary in order to be able to make on chain transactions efficient. Bitcoin is a more volatile asset, and so it doesn't lend itself as well to good DVP behaviors of a settlement system. So we see stablecoins being one way of being able to facilitate that.\nSo being able to do sort of transitions between the fiat currency world and the chain world seems to be a sensible place for us to play. It's great to see that legislation proceeding. But then behind it is also a market structure bill, and that would set really the rules of the road, the terms of engagement for how different participants can participate in digital assets. I think the very helpful thing from this administration has been to sort of create more of this level playing field and say it's a new technology, we don't want anybody to be disadvantaged, we want everybody to be able to participate, and let's do what the US is so good at, which is innovate and define global standards. And so that's where we sit today. But I wouldn't have it as a huge revenue item in the 2025 P&L.\nBut that isn't to undermine its promise over time.\n\nEbrahim Poonawalla\n\nHead Managing Director of American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from David Smith with Truist Securities.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nHead of Consumer Lending, Truist Securities\n\nHi, Good morning. A couple questions on NII. First, it looks like NII from repo and Fed funds increased again this quarter. Do you see this sustaining? Is there like expectation for a meaningful drop off? Just help us frame that. And then secondly, your deposit beta was really high, around 90% again this quarter. Obviously it's a very fluid rate backdrop, but based on what you're seeing, when might this start to level off? Since I think last cycle your beta was around 75 or 80% for the cumulative cycle.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo thanks for the question. Look, on the repo side part of NII, you know, higher than expected, and you know, we've invested quite heavily in that over the last couple of years, and we feel it's an important business for us as it relates to clients and delivering products to them. But it does, it's quite small in the context of our overall NII. It's only about 5%. So, you know, I think the business held in nicely. It's doing well. The balances are higher, and spreads are a little bit tighter. So there is kind of a couple of puts and takes there. But in the context of our overall NII, it's quite small.\nIn terms of the beta question. Look, this is a question, I guess, that's come up on a lot of calls over the last several quarters, in that, you know, we deal with a sophisticated client base and we kind of pass on the rates as we get them. And so our kind of betas have always been quite high, like, you know, in the low to mid-80s. And that's kind of where we see the book. And so the marginal beta is around 100%. And if rates were to go down, we'd see the betas to perform in line with the way, on the way up.\nSo that's kind of roughly how we see it.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nHead of Consumer Lending, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. And then just in terms of how the macro environment is affecting client activity, do you find clients are less willing to move around from one provider to another in a turbulent environment like this, or the custodians with differentiated capabilities become more attractive to a large enough extent that people will still consider moving where they hold funds?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nI think it depends on the platform. This is really where the breadth of our platforms is a real advantage for us, David, because we have these platforms that are higher frequency in terms of volumes, where things like collateral management, things like treasury clearing, things like global clearing, $1.6 trillion ecosystem in terms of Liquidity Direct. So there's absolutely the ability to move around there. But we just have these great platforms and people gravitate to us at these times, given what we have. Then there are the longer burn opportunities where people are reflecting on how to run their businesses in the best possible way. I don't think at this point it's the environment where you kick off something super big that was going to take a lot of distraction of leadership time.\nBut most of the work and most of the platforms that we provide, they don't really fit into that, into that category. And so I don't see a reason why we're not sort of business as usual in terms of the environment today. But we have to see how it plays out. If we're going to have up 6%, 7%, 8% in the stock market every day, then obviously that creates a chilling effect, almost an exhaustion effect almost by definition. But I don't think we're at this point where for our businesses, the uncertainty really cascades through into client choices today.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThe point I would add onto it is, at some level, it does create opportunity for us as well as we make our platforms better. And as clients look to optimize for their individual environments, it's going to create opportunities for us to help our clients. Clients do run things better for themselves. So, like, I would feel quite optimistic our ability to serve clients in a better way as a result of our transformation that's going on, and also a significant part of our revenue is recurring. Once we have clients on our platform, they tend to stick with us. And at times like this, that is a tremendous thing to have.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nHead of Consumer Lending, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, Good morning Folks.\nIf I could start off with a good morning. Just the platforms question going back to Robin. I think what you talked about in your earlier remarks, over half of BNY is now on the platform model. And then you talked about the costs, the efficiencies, and you cited some examples. The question would be, now that you've got half of the firm on the model, are the efficiencies and the cross sells, and if I can throw AI in there as well, exceeding your expectations so far? And if that is so, would that either translate into lower expense growth or would you tend to channel those savings into reinvest them in growth initiatives?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nWell, Brian, I'm just going to take you back to some comments that I made a few quarters ago, which is just to remind of the fact that we've been simultaneously investing in the short, medium, and long term. We did this thing, it's now in the past, but Project Catalyst, which was designed to be able to have this 1,500 ideas that we're going to be able to save us money on a run rate basis. 2025 is actually the first full year where we have the full benefit of Catalyst in the number. So we're still benefiting from some of those short term actions that we took a little while back and then simultaneously we've been investing more. And Dermot talked about this in answer to Mike's question earlier on.\nActually, the gross numbers in terms of the savings and the investments, both of them are meaningfully higher than they've been in past years. Sometimes it's a little hard to see that under the hood. But this investment into platforms operating model, it's a means to an end. We think that actually people working in this model provide some immediate benefits. You know, the agility and the ways of organizing teams create some efficiency and some more sort of pointed ability to get things done quicker with a little bit less bureaucracy and sort of nonsense getting in the way. But it's really a means to an end because the objective of operating in the platforms has always been we will be able to do more business and we'll be able to do it better and quicker. Risk management, benefits, efficiency benefits.\nIt's just got a lot of things that really suit us. For that, you don't really see those benefits until you've got a platform operating for probably at least six to 12 months to start to see that. We in fact had a great example ourselves internally where one of our earliest entrance into the platform's operating model is starting now to rethink and reimagine how the infrastructure and systems underlying their platform operate. How do those processes work across the company? It took a year for them to be in the model before they've really been able to set up their stall. So that's a long way of saying, I think the benefits of this are very much to come. They're more of a 2026 and a 2027 story, although there's some benefit in 2025 and probably through into 2028.\nAnd then we see AI as the longer term thing to layer onto that. Not too much benefit in 2025, but we've clearly started. But that layers in I would say 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029 through the end of the decade. And so it's this choreography that we've laid out as a leadership team to the different things that we're doing and how they will benefit us at different periods of time. But we got going on all of them early and that was the key.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nLike, from the CFO lens, the point. I'll give you a little bit of a history lesson if you kind of go 2022, expenses were up 8%. 2023, there were 2.7%. 2024, flat to slightly up due to the revenue growth outperforming expectations. And this year we're guiding 1% to 2%. And all of the projects that Robin referred to are feeding into those numbers. They're not something distinct and separate. So all of the things that we're doing gives us a lot of confidence to be able to give you good guidance. And ultimately the journey never ends because we're becoming a much better run company. The flywheel of initiatives is just going to outpace the efficiency, and that's going to lead to more growth opportunities.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's great color, and I think you wanted to convert the entire company by the end of the year on the platforms model. Is that correct, or was that into.\n2026?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon",
    "content2": "Yeah. Yeah. So I would think like by this time next year when we do this call, you know, all things kind of going according to plan, we would say the firm is fully operating in the new way of working. But I would double down on what Robin said, that we can see real tangible benefits from the people who went first versus the people who are just starting now. And it's a mindset change, which is really people showing up in a different way in the firm, and they're much happier in the new way of working. So culturally it's very powerful.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's great color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nMorning, Steven.\nSo.\nHope you guys are well. So I have a couple of questions on the Pershing business. There was some press coverage noting recent changes to the sharing of cash economics with some of your RIA and IBD clients. I was hoping you could just speak to what informed the pricing changes, the feedback you've gotten from the clients thus far, and how we should think about any potential benefit to NII as you retain more of those spread economics.\nSo it's something that we're continuing to do. We've opened up our platform. We want to offer our clients a lot of choice at competitive rates. We've not really made any significant changes, and we kind of keep it under review because the backdrop of the environment is so fluid. But in terms of the overall context of the NII and how it feeds into the 5% guide, it's de minimis.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nA couple contacts there, Amit. For my follow-up just on the NNA outlook in Pershing, the flow rate; it was a touch softer versus some of the recent, call it mid-single-digit or better, NNA flows that you've been seeing in recent quarters. Recognize there's a lot of volatility and uncertainty in the current backdrop, but I was hoping you could just speak to what drove the moderation inflows, whether you expect that to continue amid the recent volatility. And if you could also clarify the timing and impact of the pending Atria departure, just to make sure we have all the moving pieces accounted for.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo as it relates to the purging. So on the positive side, a lot of volume on the platform, you know, Robin talked to different platforms and the uptick in volume over the last couple of weeks. So we see a lot of volume in terms of transaction activity flowing through the Pershing pipes, which is good for us as it relates to NNA growth and opportunity. It's like it's a choppy environment. I would put it down to timing. We had some decent sized mandates that could have signed in Q1 slipped to Q2, and that's like just more about the timing of when stuff comes on. So from quarter to quarter, I expect we'll see a little bit more choppiness of that. But on the more positive side, I would say we continue to see kind of strong client uptake in the pipeline.\nFor Wove, we gave a guide in January which was for 2025, roughly $60 to $70 million. We still feel very good about that guide. We've now got 52 clients on the platform. We signed 22 contracts in Q1. And so now we're kind of building up ahead of steam in terms of client migrations onto the platform. And so the client's excitement about that product continues to kind of give us confidence about saying mid single digits through the cycle as it relates to NNA.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's right.\nAnd the Atria impact.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nWe don't necessarily disclose, you know, individual transactions, but you know, coming to a store near you this either next quarter or the quarter after.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Well, thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nMorning.\nBetsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nA couple of questions, one just on the Treasury Direct Express program that's moving over to your platform. I just want to confirm that already started and wanted to get a sense as to anything you can share on how we should expect that's going to roll through and impact, if at all visible, P&L.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo I don't think that beta, the P&L won't be visible in terms of size or lumpiness. We're very excited to have won the business. It was really, you know, to be honest with you, that was a real strength of the platform operating model in terms of our ability to bring the firm together to win that mandate. So that was a real kind of nice proof point for us that we were on the right track as it relates to the treasury service model. We expect it to ramp up in the latter part of this year. But in terms of moving the needle for the firm's revenues, it's just another happy client wanting to do business with BNY, and it's going to come into the run rate latter part of this year. So to be in the full-year numbers next year.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And then as I'm looking at the deposit and the NIB, IB, I thought in the past, NIB, you were thinking that might move down towards $44 billion. Is that the case still or not? If that changed, why?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo we're a little bit higher than that. And so, you know, our current. We kind of believe that it's going to roughly hang in the zip code that it's currently in, may moderate a little bit from here due to some cash sorting, but we don't expect any meaningful change on it. And that kind of feeds the 5% guide.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, and then you mentioned if the Fed cuts 50 basis points tomorrow, there's no NII impact. What should we be keeping an eye out for that would drive an NII impact? Is it flattening of the curve, sharp flattening, anything, or you're good in any situation?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nI think under a wide range of situations for 2025 with the expected on the rate curve, we're good. Obviously if something happens materially with levels of balances and mix shift, that would impact it. But we've done a lot of analysis and so we feel reasonably good under a wide range of scenarios.\nThe NII is okay for sure as a result.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThat was a deliberate strategy, Betsy, because we really wanted to take the risk of 2025 sort of out out of things. That was work that the team did last year because, you know, NII is obviously a very valuable contribution to our firm, and we appreciate it as part of our overall operating leverage. But as Dermot said earlier, on positive operating leverage is the North Star, and we have other levers around, of course, fees. Now market is a variable, but it's. Remember, our fees aren't only about market because they're also about volume, volumes, activity levels; Wove is a software sale as well. And then we have the all important lever of expenses, which is, as Dermot and I both said, we've been spending a considerable amount of money on investments. We see nothing in the environment today to suggest that we should stop that.\nBut given the fact that the total gross of savings and investments is bigger and is part of the 1% to 2% guide that Dermot gave you, it follows from that that we have choices underneath that if we needed them. So positive operating lever, the anchor NII is sure great, but like kind of it's all about the other stuff.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director of Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director of Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nGood afternoon. Dermot, can you share with us your thoughts about you talked about the immunization that you guys did. And Robin, you just touched on it last year following Jackson Hole for this, you know, this year's NII. Would you consider doing something like that for 2026 as the year progresses or was that kind of a once one and done kind of strategy?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nNo, absolutely. Very much focused on 26.\nActive work. And.\nWe're always looking at the markets, we're always looking how to optimize our balance sheet.\nThe partnership between, we call it the tripod internally, is just really, really strong. I think we'll feel good about the 2026 outlook when we come to talk about it.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director of Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nVery good. I don't think you guys touched on this. I apologize if you did, if I missed it. There's a lot of talk about regulatory change on the horizon, specifically when it comes to the supplementary leverage ratio, which I think you guys in the past have pointed out to all of us that you're binding capital constraint. Assuming there is relief where they exclude those treasury securities and possibly mortgage-backed securities from the calculation of the SLR. Can you share with us how that would impact the way you manage your balance sheet and the outlook for revenue should that change?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSure. Let me split the question into the two pieces. So, first, the impact on us, and it can get a little weedy here because there is actually three different leverage ratios. There's an ESLR, which is the Fed's gift to take away. There's an SLR, which is a three-agency rule across the FDIC, the OCC, and the Fed. And then there's a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, which there's some legal debate about whether or not the Fed has the ability to make changes to that. But it's really in Dodd-Frank. And so that's the one that applies to all banks. We have a little bit of a different treatment on us just given the nature of the businesses that we're in. But we are bound by Tier 1 Leverage Ratio. And we've said that, we said that before.\nSo SLR can have some change, but maybe not quite as much on us. But now let me take the other part of the question and just, you know, sort of respond to, you know, what's going on in the space. We've had a point of view for a long time that we actually think that leverage ratio was ill advised and it's not really about banks. It kind of came about to some extent out of the financial crisis, is almost like in a moment of anger towards banks that existed at that point. But the problem is the casualty of the situation is markets because we want banks to be able to flex their size, particularly in cash on their balance sheet and in Treasuries on their balance sheet. Remember, the SLR penalizes a one-day cash management bill in terms of the balance sheet.\nSo it does not help markets when we take out one of the accordion flexes to be able to absorb treasury supply. We've probably been seeing that as a contributor to treasury spreads being wider over the course of the past week. I don't see this administration or the incoming leaders into the agencies to want to continue to be in this gold plating business, which is what some of these rules have been in the US. I see them in the business of wanting to unleash the power of US capital markets and make sure that capital markets are working for the US economy and that banks are fully able to operate to support capital markets and make them run as efficiently as possible.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director of Head of US Bank Equity Strategy and Large Cap Bank Analyst, RBC\n\nRobin, thank you. Very insightful.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nHappy to do it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take a question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nHey, Good afternoon.\nI think maybe a broader question on organic growth. I think, Robin, you mentioned earlier that you might have had record new business wins. So is there a way to kind of frame that in terms of percentage terms year-over-year terms, just trying to think through?\nThe progress towards getting that organic growth rate up and where you stand today?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYes, well, you know, we tried to put one stat in my prepared remarks, but we've got a few that sort of relate to this in terms of the increase I like as one good indicator, and we talked about this in the last earnings call. The number of clients buying from three or more lines of business, our platforms of which, as you know, we have many, increased by 40% over the past two years. And so that's actually the biggest driver, which is having those clients who are doing two or three things with us do an extra thing.\nAnd in fact, the clients who do more with us and we again we talked about this back in January, the clients who do more with us tends to understand us better and tend to do even more things with us because they appreciate the breadth of the relationship, they appreciate how our platforms can link together, and we can just be a more efficient ecosystem for them. I'll give you one example. If you do clearing with BNY and you do collateral with BNY, then in Treasuries as an example, the ability for us to link up the ecosystem around our Liquidity Direct platform, our collateral management platform, world number one, our US Treasury platform world number one, the world number one in global custody. We can link those things up and those become book entry transfers on our custody ledger.\nAnd so that's just a more efficient way to operate. And we see that linkage as we get better operating as one firm. Deploying our commercial model, having clients understand how they can see all of those different platforms, there are actually more and more synergy benefits for them. So this is the, we've said this all along, this is the single biggest avenue of growth for us is to have more of our clients do more of what we do. And then we add to that the innovation. We add to that finding new clients. We add to that the megatrends that we talked about last time. But we are quite optimistic about the amount of runway we have under this heading.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nLook, if you go back and look at a script from two years ago versus the script today in terms of our how we talk to the market, we're talking about more things with you. More products Wove, Archer. Our growth in ETFs quite strong, which we haven't talked about today. Also building out our infrastructure and alternatives. Robin mentioned it in his prepared remarks, like the appointment of Carolyn Weinberg is a really important strategic step for us in terms of innovating around new products.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nYeah, absolutely.\nSo I guess versus two years ago.\nIs it fair to assume you seem even more confident in driving this improvement and still kind of early days? Is that a fair way to think about it?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nI would say that we've matured in this. We originally, if you were to analyze our language over time, the theme is very much there, but our conviction around it has grown and importantly, we've moved it along the maturity curve. Originally it was connecting the dots, then it was one BNY mentality. Now it's our commercial model. This is our first full year operating in our new commercial model under the leadership of our Chief Commercial Officer. So we've been maturing the concept, but our vision of this is unchanged. But our conviction in it and the maturity, operationalization, repeatability, embedding in this company is growing.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Large-Cap Bank Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nI was just looking for one wrap up number just even if it's just what you're conceptually thinking, because you're talking about all these revenue growth initiatives, products, platforms, processes, and people. And you talk about clients involving more than three lines of business. But then you also say there's some caveats because markets will be what markets will do. So I'm just trying. You can help us out with our earnings models, but not for the next quarter, for the next three to five years. The main question is what should be the core organic growth rate ahead and what has it been in the past? Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nSo, like, I think that's a conversation for offline. I would say, Mike, when you visit, but I kind of, when I come in every day, I just, I care about positive operating leverage consistently through the cycle, which is made up of fees, NII, and how we manage the firm as it relates to expenses, as it relates to fees. We make fees are of a couple of different components, balances, volume, and other. So I feel a lot more confident today than I did two years ago in our ability to drive innovation, drive execution, and to do more with our existing client set and also add new clients to the firm. That's just a journey we're going to be on and we're going to execute to a very high standard.\nAnd so we kind of feel very good about our ability to do positive operating leverage through the cycle in good times and bad.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nAnd Mike, I'll add to that just by saying that, look, if you step back and I'm sorry, this is a little bit. I'll give you the one number reminder and then I'll make a bit more of a philosophical comment. So look, 2/3 of our 6% fee growth in 2024 was market and currency, and 1/3 was organic. And that's good.\nThat was a step up versus the prior year. Obviously, we're determined to see that grind higher. So if you take that as our aspiration, then the question is, do we actually have the right inputs? Are we doing the right things that actually make that legitimate and plausible? So number one, are we actually getting around operationally more with our clients? Are we actually covering them better? Are we actually driving outcomes from them? That's important. Where's our trust and reputation? Do people worry about the firm? No, they're very confident. It's this point about platforms built on a very solid foundation, making our balance sheet high quality, de-risked excess capital, high amounts of liquidity that gives them confidence to be able to lean in. All indications are that that is what happens when they have that reaction.\nAnd then critically, do we actually have the right products? And so this is where the breadth of the firm really matters. We're not a two-trick or three-trick pony; we're a dozen-trick pony. We can do everything from investment and wealth, to retail wealth, to collateral management, to clearing, to payments, to liquidity, ecosystems, et cetera, et cetera. So we have this breadth, and then the question is, can you actually operationalize the joining of these things together, and then do you have innovation? And so we think we're actually attacking the problem through all of those dimensions. And if we do that, we do it consistently, deliberately, and relentlessly; then we think we will win, and that's what we're doing.\n\nJim Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Seaport Global Securities\n\nWell, that was a comprehensive answer. Thank you very much.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks everyone for your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow up questions. Be well and good luck out there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for Q4 of 2024. I'm joined by Robin Vince, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with a strategic update, followed by Dermot with his financial update and outlook. Both will reference our quarterly update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I'll also note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and quarterly update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 15 January 2025, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Marius. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into our results, I want to address the ongoing wildfires affecting parts of Los Angeles. We're heartbroken by the tremendous loss being suffered by the community where we have several offices. As always, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of our employees and clients located in the affected areas, and we have also committed matching employee donations to eligible nonprofits, providing relief and recovery to those impacted by the fires. Turning now to our quarterly update presentation. 2024 was an exciting year for BNY, and we are entering 2025 with strong momentum on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company.\nBuilding on the solid foundation that we laid in 2023, we accelerated the pace of our ongoing transformation and closed out 2024 with a strong performance, delivering record net income of $4.3 billion on record revenue of $18.6 billion and generating a return on tangible common equity of 23% for the year. Aligned to our three strategic pillars: to be more for our clients, to run our company better, and to power our culture. At this time last year, we laid out a set of medium-term financial targets, as well as our action plan to drive sustainably higher revenue growth over time. We're executing against these plans and targets every day. As you can see on page three of our presentation, we made very tangible progress in terms of delivery in 2024. For our clients, the rollout of our new commercial coverage model was an important milestone.\nEffectively cross-selling and leveraging the breadth of our business platforms is the single most compelling growth opportunity for the company. Our commercial model is designed to deliver from across the company at an accelerated pace, improve the client experience, and ultimately deepen our relationships. This is the operationalization of 1BNY. Our growth is not just about more of the same. Delivering innovative solutions to the market that leverage the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY is another important way for us to be more for our clients and drive top-line growth. This is 1BNY version 2.0. Our acquisition of Archer is a good example for BNY becoming an end-to-end solutions provider, in this case, across the entire managed account ecosystem, be it manufacturing in BNY Investments, distribution through Pershing, or servicing through Archer.\nOver the course of 2024, we also developed numerous new client solutions, such as Collateral One, Alts Bridge, a next-gen ETF servicing platform, and new capabilities on Wove. This new product momentum is an important investment for the years ahead. Continuing the investment theme, over the course of the year, we further increased our investments to drive both revenues and scalability, and we generated approximately $0.5 billion of efficiency savings as we continue to digitize workflows and begin to leverage new technologies, including AI. We also commenced the phased transition to our strategic Platforms Operating Model in the spring, and over the course of 2024, transitioned approximately 13,000 employees, or roughly one quarter of the company, into this new way of working. Zooming out for a moment, the wrapper for much of our work is culture.\nPowering our culture remains essential to everything else, and we are starting to see the benefits of our people around the world working more closely together. Celebrating our company's 240th anniversary in 2024 with colleagues, clients, and many other stakeholders around the world felt even more special at a moment in which our people could start to see their hard work leaving a positive mark on this iconic institution. Considering the transformation underway at our company, we decided that the time was right last summer to simplify and modernize our brand and logo to improve the market's familiarity of who we are and what we do. The benefits of BNY's improved visibility in the market have also supported our recruiting efforts. Throughout the year, we've been successful in attracting top talent across the firm, from recruiting our largest intern and analyst classes to further rounding out our executive leadership team.\nAnd the targeted investments we've been making in the employee experience across learning, benefits, and facilities are being recognized and valued by our people. Another important aspect of powering our culture is to deliver on our commitments. We've work hard to say what we do and to do what we say. Turning to page four, I'm pleased that in 2024, we once again met or exceeded our financial goals for the year. We are confident that BNY can deliver positive operating leverage across a wide range of scenarios, and so we started 2024 determined to at least break even from an operating leverage perspective. That was an ambitious goal at the time, considering that our revenue outlook at the beginning of the year foreshadowed an approximately 10% NII headwind to largely offset growth in fee revenue.\nTherefore, we had to set up to keep expenses, excluding notable items, roughly flat, while at the same time self-funding incremental investments in the business. Dermot will discuss the financials in more detail, but in summary, in 2024, we delivered 968 basis points of positive operating leverage on a reported basis, and 288 basis points excluding notable items. We grew fee revenue by 6% year-over-year, and NII was down 1%, outperforming our outlook from the beginning of the year by approximately 9 percentage points. Despite higher-than-expected revenue, expenses were down 4% year-over-year on a reported basis, and up 1% excluding notable items. And finally, consistent with our outlook, we returned 102% of 2024 earnings to our shareholders. Taken together, we delivered record financial results in 2024.\nSignificant positive operating leverage resulted in pre-tax margin expansion and improved profitability, and we delivered attractive capital returns to our shareholders, all of which underscored the execution of a reinvigorated BNY. But now, let's look forward on page five. We are entering 2025 with strong momentum and determination to deliver further value for our clients and shareholders. BNY plays a central role in global capital markets, with $52 trillion of AUCA, $14 trillion of debt serviced, $3 trillion of wealth assets, and $5.6 trillion of assets on our collateral management platform. We manage $2 trillion of AUM, and on an average day, we settle over $15 trillion worth of securities and roughly $2.5 trillion worth of payments for clients around the world.\nThis exceptional client franchise and leadership across our diversified financial services platforms positions us well to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends, several of which we describe on the left-hand side of the page. Some of our fastest-growing businesses in 2024, Treasury Services, Clearing and Collateral Management, and Corporate Trust, demonstrate our gearing toward economic growth and higher capital markets activity, both public and private. Through Pershing and Wealth, we are a leader in serving one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, the US wealth market. Within that market, our wealth business is focused on the faster-growing ultra-high-net-worth space. Our Pershing business, on the other hand, leverages the size and scale of our platforms to power advisors' businesses, helping them navigate an increasingly complex operating environment using the power of our technology.\nRelevant for both retail and institutional investors, the trend toward private markets represents an opportunity for BNY to support our clients end-to-end, from servicing to distribution, cash investment, FX hedging, and lending across traditional and alternative asset classes. Last year also saw the mass adoption of digital asset exchange-traded products in the US, which grew to more than $100 billion in assets under management. BNY has been an early mover in the digital asset space. Today, we provide fund services for the vast majority of digital asset exchange-traded products in both the US and Canada. Over the long term, we believe digital assets and the technology underpinnings have the transformative potential to help solve client and market needs.\nTnally, on this list of important market trends, as global markets evolve and become ever more complex, both buy-side and sell-side firms are looking to outsource certain functions and consolidate providers in order to gain scale and reduce risk. We expect the strength and connectivity of our platforms to be a differentiator in this regard. As we think about the operating environment in 2025, just a month ago, there were clear signs of optimism with the US election behind us, inflation moderating, and the Fed having begun its path toward lower rates. But with the turn of the year, we view the outlook for 2025 as a little more uncertain, with persistent tail risks across geopolitical tensions and conflicts, uncertainty about trade and fiscal policies, and volatility in markets.\nAgainst this backdrop, being positioned conservatively with a strong balance sheet and operational resilience allows us to remain focused on executing our ongoing transformation. While we've made good progress against our strategic priorities over the past 12 months, we have a lot more work ahead of us. As I've said before, strategy is important. Actually doing it and how we do it matters the most. On the right-hand side of this page is the reminder of our strategic priorities, and underneath each are some indicators for the progress that we're making. The makeup of our new business wins in 2024 (we highlighted some of them on our earnings calls over the past year) validated for us that there is real demand in the market for the type of integrated solutions that BNY can deliver.\nFor example, last year, we've seen a 30% year-on-year increase in sales from clients buying from three or more lines of business. This remains a work in progress, but with real runway ahead. Our commercial model enables our client coverage teams to more effectively deliver integrated solutions from across BNY to our clients, and our Platforms Operating Model realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire organization in furtherance of that commercial opportunity. 2025 will be a milestone year for BNY's adoption of the Platforms Operating Model. This transition is not just about driving efficiency. It is also about enabling top-line growth. By simplifying, streamlining, and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys, improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs, and accelerate speed to market.\nThis quarter, we're planning to activate our largest wave of platforms yet so that by the end of March, more than half of our people will be working in the model. We believe that our transition into this model will have a meaningful impact at BNY over the years to come, and so we've included in the appendix of this presentation a summary of the program and the timeline for implementation. Next, our investments in digitization and AI over the last couple of years have laid a solid foundation for us to become more efficient and to drive top-line growth over time. We're embracing the power of AI to make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and channel their energy towards new innovations.\nTo summarize this broader alpha and beta theme, we believe that we are well-positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends while we remain focused on generating alpha through the continued transformation of the company. I'll wrap up on page six by reminding you of the value proposition that we laid out for our clients, our shareholders, and our people at the beginning of last year. Our strategic priorities and financial goals are clear, and we remain focused on consistent execution. Before I turn the call over to Dermot for our financial update and outlook, I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world. I'm proud of what our people have accomplished over the past two years and grateful for everyone's continued dedication to the hard work that's ahead of us. With that, over to you, Dermot.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI'm picking up on page nine of the presentation and will first touch upon 2024 highlights before diving into the results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $18.6 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 6%. Investment services fees grew 7%, reflecting net new business, higher market values, and client activity across our security services and market and wealth services segments. Investment management and performance fees from our investment and wealth management segment were up 3%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Despite a year of relatively muted volatility, foreign exchange revenue was up 9% on the back of higher client volumes. Net interest income was down 1%, reflecting changes in the deposit mix, partially offset by higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.\nExpenses of $12.7 billion were down 4% year-over-year on a reported basis, largely reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the FDIC Special Assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 1%, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. On a reported basis, pre-tax margin was 31%, and return on tangible common equity was 23% for the year. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 33%, and return on tangible common equity was 24%. We reported earnings per share of $5.80. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $6.03, up 19% year-over-year. We returned 102% of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2024. Now turning to page 11 for the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 9%.\nThis includes 9% growth in investment services fees, reflecting net new business, higher client activity, and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were also up 9%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. Firm-wide AUCA of $52.1 trillion were up 9% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Assets under management of $2 trillion were up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 24%, driven by higher client volumes. Investment and other revenue was $140 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $144 million reduction in investment and other revenue related to a fair value adjustment of a receivable.\nExcluding notable items, the year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the absence of strategic equity investment gains recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Net Interest Income increased by 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.4 billion were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC Special Assessment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding notable items, which were primarily severance and higher litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 2024, expenses were up 2%. This reflects higher revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and increased investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $20 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure. Pre-tax margin was 30%, and Return on Tangible Common Equity was 23%.\nExcluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 34%, and Return on Tangible Common Equity was 26%. We reported earnings per share of $1.54, and excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.72, up 33% year-over-year. Turning to capital and liquidity on page 12. Our Tier one Leverage Ratio for the quarter was 5.7%. Tier one capital decreased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends, partially offset by capital generated through earnings. Average assets were up 1%. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.2%. CET1 capital decreased by 5% sequentially, and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the fourth quarter. Moving to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 115%, and the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%.\nNext, net interest income and balance sheet trends on page 13. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 8% year-over-year and up 14% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Average deposit balances increased by 1% sequentially. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by 7% in the quarter, and interest-bearing deposits decreased by 1%. Average interest-earning assets were flat quarter over quarter. Our cash and reverse repo, loan, and investment securities portfolio balances all remained flat. Turning to our business segments starting on page 14. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 6% year-over-year. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 7%, primarily reflecting higher market values, client activity, and net new business. We're pleased with the broad-based momentum in asset servicing.\nClients are increasingly looking to leverage the scale of BNY's platforms and utilize the differentiated breadth of our capabilities. At the same time, we continue to see particular strength in ETF and alternative servicing, validating the multi-year investments we've made into these platforms. ETF AUCA of $2.8 trillion were up over 60% year-over-year, with inflows into ETFs on our platform once again outpacing the market, and alternatives AUCA were up 20% year-over-year. In issuer services, investment services fees were up 4%. Healthy net new business and higher client activity in corporate trust was partially offset by lower depository receipt fees, reflecting a higher level of corporate actions and cross-border activity in the prior year quarter. Over the course of 2024, we've maintained our market-leading share in straight debt servicing, and by increasing our market share in CLO servicing, further strengthened our number two position.\nIn this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 25% year-over-year, reflecting growth from higher client activity. Net interest income for the segment was up 7% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were up 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher litigation reserves, employee merit increases, and higher investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $643 million, a 39% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 28%. Next, Markets and Wealth Services on page 15. Markets and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 12% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 9%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. Net new assets were $41 billion, including a large client onboarding in the quarter. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees increased by 13%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and clearance volumes.\nWe continued to see strong US securities clearance volumes on the back of US treasury issuance, as well as trading activity across the platform. We remain focused on increasing market connectivity by expanding our global collateral platform to new markets. In treasury services, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting net new business. In November, the US Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service selected BNY as the new financial agent for the Direct Express Program. This decision to appoint BNY speaks to our organization's strength in driving commercial outcomes that broaden access to the financial ecosystem. The program leverages our innovative and resilient payments capabilities to provide disbursement services at scale. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 9% year-over-year.\nSegment expenses of $852 million were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue-related expenses, investments, and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower litigation reserves. Pre-tax income was up 28% year-over-year at $806 million, representing a 48% pre-tax margin. Turning to investment and wealth management on page 16. Investment and wealth management reported total revenue of $873 million, up 29% year-over-year. In our investment management business, revenue was up 41%. Excluding a notable item in the prior year quarter, revenue was up 5%, reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. And in wealth management, revenue increased by 9%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. Segment expenses of $700 million were up 2% year-over-year, as higher revenue-related expenses and employee merit increases were partially offset by efficiency savings.\nPre-tax income was $173 million, and pre-tax margin was 20%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. In the fourth quarter, we saw net outflows of $15 billion. This includes $27 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $12 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth management's client assets of $327 billion increased by 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 17 shows the results of the other segment. Next, on page 19, our current outlook for 2025. Positive operating leverage continues to be our North Star, and so once again, we have set ourselves up to drive positive operating leverage consistent with our medium-term financial targets.\nStarting with NII, based on current market implied forward interest rates, we expect full year 2025 NII to be up mid-single-digit percentage points year-over-year. We expect fee revenue to be up year-over-year. We expect approximately 1-2% year-over-year growth in expenses, excluding notable items for the full year 2025. Specific to Q1, I would like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees. Then on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the 22%-23% range. Finally, our philosophy for capital deployment and distributions remains unchanged. We anticipate to continue to pursue growth opportunities and deliver compelling capital returns to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Based on what we are seeing today, we expect to return 100% ± 2025 earnings over the course of the year.\nAs always, we will calibrate the pace of our buybacks, considering factors such as balance sheet growth opportunities, as well as macroeconomic and interest rate environments, which are real considerations in 2025. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio management target remains unchanged at 5.5-6%. Against the backdrop of continued interest rate volatility, we will continue to manage ourselves to the upper end of that range for the foreseeable future. To wrap up on page 20. In January of last year, we shared our firm-wide medium-term financial targets, which were to improve BNY's pre-tax margin to equal to or greater than 33%, and our Return on Tangible Common Equity to equal to or greater than 23% over the medium term, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nWe have made solid progress towards these targets over the past 12 months and are excited about the year in front of us as our people harness the momentum and continue to embrace our pillars and principles in order to consistently meet or exceed our targets through the cycle. As Robin said at the top of the call, we're pleased with our performance this past year, and we're heading into 2025 with good momentum, confident that we're on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. With that, Operator, can you please open the line?\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. We'll take our first question from Ibrahim Punawalla with Bank of America.\n\nIbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead Managing Director, BofA\n\nHey, good afternoon.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nHey, Ibrahim.\n\nIbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead Managing Director, BofA\n\nYes. Hey, Robin. I guess first question, and it's with the lens of I'm trying to see if you'll hit your pre-tax margin ROE targets on an adjusted basis this year. I guess I understand it's equal to or greater than. I'm trying to get a sense of the resiliency of these numbers as you've done a great job executing over the last year or two of what the runway is. Is it reasonable for us to assume that those pre-tax margins being higher than where you are today is actually achievable, assuming no big market shocks? Maybe if you want to, at a very high level, address that, Robin, and then I can follow up.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nHi, Ibrahim. It's Dermot here.\nI would say, as it relates to the medium-term targets that we gave this time last year, and I think you collectively as a group liked those targets that we gave you. Since Robin has taken on the role of CEO, we've had eight quarters where we've executed very well. I'd like to think that we've established a track record of execution and holding ourselves accountable, as Robin said in his prepared remarks, \"Say what you do and do as what you say.\" We feel confident that we're going to hit those targets sustainably through the cycle. You're going to see more of the same from us on what you've seen in the last couple of years into 2025 and beyond.\n\nIbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead Managing Director, BofA\n\nUnderstood.\nI guess if I look at slide five and just this whole conversation around 80% of employees being o the platform model by end of 2025, if you could address that in two ways in terms of does that result in a lot more resilience to your fee revenue growth relative to whatever may happen to markets, one, like the resiliency that provides in terms of the synergies you're getting from moving to that model? Again, as that flows through in terms of these targets, could you actually do much better than where we've been for the last few quarters on the back of the and maybe that's a 2026 event. I'm just wondering if the platform allows for more resilient fee revenue growth and actually an improvement relative to where we are on margins and ROE.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThe way I think about it is if you look at the three pillars of the strategy: be more for clients, run our company better, empower our culture. Then underneath that, which we talk about less but are very important in terms of how we run the company internally, are the pillars and how we show up in terms of behaviors every day. The Platforms Operating Model, which we've laid out a page for you page 22, really is the mechanism by which we drive the three pillar. I do really believe quite strongly that the Platforms Operating Model will drive incremental top-line growth, will make the top-line growth more resilient, but also will allow us to run the company better and become more efficient with that.\nThat then, in turn, we used the words over the last couple of years, de-siloing, bringing our businesses closer together. That really speaks to, on the top-line side, the launch of the commercial operating model that we kind of went out with in the middle of last year. You take all those discrete elements together and you add it together, you kind of go, \"Okay, fee revenue is going to incrementally grind higher for me here with the tools that we're deploying and executing.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\n\" Ibrahim, I'd add one thing to it, which is just this concept that we've talked about before on the call about short, medium, and long term. We have consistently been investing both for the top line and also for expense efficiency with all three time horizons.\nWe've been trying to do that pretty consistently over the past two years. that's relevant for your question because it isn't just a 2026 story. It's actually going to be a 2027, 2028, and 2029 story as well, in our opinion, because some of what the platform's model enables is really a foundational point that then allows us to do other things. Retiring systems comes after that. We've retired some. We can retire more. Being able to do more solutioning for clients, we've done some, but we can do even more. Tt's quite a bedrock thing for us. given the fact that we won't even be fully into the model until 2026, I think you can expect that there's more payoff to come 2026, 2027, 2028, through the end of the decade, quite frankly, if we do this well.\n\nIbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead Managing Director, BofA\n\nGot it.\nThat's a great slide, the slide 27. Good job. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nHead of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Just two things. One, just to wrap up on that last topic. Given that 2023, 2024, you got to 25% of the folks in the 1BNY in the operating model, the platform model. in 2025, you're putting on an incremental 60%. I get that the benefits of all of this is multi-year, but that's a step up in the percentage of employees that are going to be joining the platform in 2025. Should we expect that operating leverage will also increase given this large slug of folks coming in in 2025?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nI would say the two things aren't a direct correlation in terms of the way that you're linking it, Betsy, because as you go back to the beginning of our platform's operating model, we're already three years into this if you include the very thought at the beginning of the process. Because we started actually looking at this and thinking about this during my transition into the CEO role. We then designed, we then started to test, we then started to actually execute. the deliberateness with which we've gone about this has been very important because we knew that it was a very fundamental change for the company, and we wanted to make sure that we were doing it progressively.\nAlthough there are some benefits from employee satisfaction and speeding up some of the ways that we work as people go into the model, the real benefits so far we've observed based on the pilots that we actually started doing in 2022 come more like a year or so afterwards as the teams are getting into their new rhythms of working. then so there's a phased delivery, and then you have the benefit of, \"Okay, now you've got a really tight team operating at a higher velocity. Now what can you do with that?\" Better in control of their design of their systems, better in control of the design of their client products, rationalizing the back end in terms of the multiple potentially duplicative things. we see the lead time associated with it.\nI think that the payoffs that you and Ibrahim were scratching at are there, but they're not there as immediately as you're talking about. Now, notwithstanding that, we've got other things, back to my short, medium, and long-term observation, that we have invested in that we feel quite confident will deliver us the expense benefits in 2025 that are part of our guide.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nHead of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. It just feels like going from 25% to 80%, in one year should over time bump up that operating leverage rate. Anyway, that's okay. All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Betsy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brennan Hawkin with UBS. Brennan, your line is now open.\n\nBrennan Hawkin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nSorry. Had the mute button pressed. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. We saw a really solid rebound in net new assets at Pershing this quarter.\nCurious if you could maybe compare and contrast how that would look like for net new assets in prior quarters ex the offboarding, which we were dealing with. Robin, I believe you spoke to ultra high net worth as a client segment driving or a wealth strata driving some of this. Could you speak to maybe what type of firms are driving this growth? Is it RIAs? Is it broker-dealers? Any particular sources of strength? Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks for the question, Brennan. Look, 2024, it was a noisy year given the large offboarding. We had, as I said in my prepared remarks, a large onboarding in Q4.\nLook, the way to think about it is we'd like to reiterate we think we have a good ability and the right to win and grow our net new assets at mid-single digits through the cycle. That's across the space, whether it's RIAs, whether it's broker-dealers, banks. We have the team and the technology in place. If you just look at Wove, this time last year, we kind of gave a guide on Wove. We executed the guide on that. We've re-guided higher again this year on Wove. We've now got 36 clients on the platform. We've 41 signed contracts. All in all, we feel like we have kind of a really, really big momentum on Pershing going forward. It's one of the bigger pieces of business that's going into the Platforms Operating Model in Q1.\nWe seem to see incremental benefits for that. Pershing continues to be a very, very strong business for us, and we continue to see it growing. Like Robin will touch on the wealth tech sector, but that is one of the fastest growing areas in the market, and we are a big player in that space.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah, the thing that I'd add, Brennan, is just you made the point about ultra high net worth. That's really in our BNY Wealth business. We like that business. It's been a solid performer. We think there's more upside in that over time. Then Pershing is really across the high-net-worth space, and that's got its focus on billion-dollar-plus RIA firms. That's where we're investing. Together, they're about $3 trillion worth of wealth assets.\nWhen we think about what is the market trend, we think the US wealth market's a big trend, and we're actually approaching it through both of those businesses: one ultra high net worth, one real software and service approaching the broader retail market.\n\nBrennan Hawkin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. Then shifting gears a bit on the NII expectations, certainly outlook looks better this year than it did a year ago. Could you maybe help us understand what you would think the trajectory would look like? Do you still think you're largely very neutral? Should that cadence be largely stable? You made a reference to changes in the deposit mix. Are there any notable shifts in deposit mix that you're assuming as you model out the year? Okay.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nIn order to answer the question, Brennan, I'd like to maybe spend a couple of seconds just reflecting on 2024, where we gave the guide down 10%. We came in down 1%. When I think back on that year, for me, it was really kind of broken into three years in one. When we sat here at this time last year, I think the market implied forward curve was pricing in about six to seven rate cuts. Then clearly, the Fed was signaling higher for longer, that kind of in the spring. That's the way we were positioned at the time. Then clarity over the summer, you had Jackson Hole around the time of the Fed pivot.\nWe were very proactive on the asset side of the balance sheet there in terms of repositioning the book in terms of taking advantage of the higher rates at the time before the Fed started the easing cycle, which we've factored into our guide for this year. Then as we went into the fall and we had a very strong finish to the end of the year, and that was really the strength of the franchise, clients doing more with us, which led to higher balances overall, particularly NIBs, particularly in the corporate trust space where we had more clients doing year-end activity. Now, on balances overall, we've seen that moderate a little bit at the beginning of the year, as you would expect, particularly on the NIB side\nThe whole NII is made up of balances. It's made up of the forward curve. It's made up of clients doing stuff with us. It's made up of what we're doing on the asset side. I've said this many times on prior calls, I really do believe that we have a unique strength in terms of the tripod, in terms of the interaction between our CIO, the GLS leadership, and then our treasurer. That team is working really, really well to deliver the strength of the franchise, which shows up in that strong guide of mid-single digits for this year.\n\nBrennan Hawkin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks for that color.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. I'm torn on this financial services platform company transformation.\nOn the one hand, it's great if everyone's on the same platform. You can have the 1BNY. On the other hand, it just seems like a lot of work to go from 25% employees to 80% with all looks like you're ripping the guts out of the company. Maybe you have to run parallel systems. Maybe you have training. I'm just, when you add it all together, in the short term, are you guiding for positive operating leverage in 2025? When you're going through a transformation like this, it's tough to show any positive operating leverage. I get that. Then what are you really playing for in the end? I get 1BNY. I get 1 platform. It's just a little too conceptual. Could you just put a little more meat on the bones?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nAbsolutely, Mike.\nHappy to. To make this a little clearer, let me just take you back for a moment to something that we talked about two years ago on the call when we were describing the work that we had done to really underwrite who BNY was, what we do, who does it, how we do it. We came to this point of view that the essence of the company is that we really provide technology, services, and software for clients to build their businesses on. We have these market-leading platforms, number one in collateral, number one in securities lending, number one in issuer services. Yeah, we're the world's number one custodian as well. We've got this big three trillion wealth platform that we just talked about. These things are essentially a combination of technology and software and services.\nAllowing our clients to be able to build business, leverage the scale of that platform is the very heart of our growth. You can see it in the numbers because market and wealth services, where we've got a lot of those platforms, not all of them, is the part of the company that is the most profitable, with the highest margin, and it's the fastest growing. With that said, recognizing who we are, we had to do two things around how we approach it. Number one, we had to get serious and organized around the commercial front end of that. That 1BNY, the new commercial model, the stats that we gave you in the presentation around how we're driving to do more things for those clients, we're doing more solutions, as well as adding new products.\nThe other thing that we had to do is you just can't run a siloed back-end organization with multiple versions of everything. I'm not just talking about systems, platforms. I'm talking about the very organization of the people. We had, we've joked about this before. We had eight call centers. We had multiple custody pieces of technology. We onboarded clients in every individual bit of the company separately. That just doesn't work for the nature of the company that we are and where we're headed. We determined that we had to operate and organize differently. That's what Platforms Operating Model is about. But to Betsy's question, we've been very deliberate about organizing it over a multiple time frame. We don't want to create disruption. We don't think we are.\nWe don't think we've had any setback in terms of who we are in grinding through the year because of this. We actually think at the margin, it's been a tailwind each year. It can just be an even bigger tailwind in the out years. And with three key metrics in mind. One, employee satisfaction has gone up as people have been in the model and operated in it. The second thing is we've delivered better for clients, and the velocity of that new delivery has gone up. Then the third thing is the efficiency with which we're operating those groups has also improved. You're right. It's a big change. This is not something you drift into. It's not something you do if you've got a quick cleanup mentality for a couple of years.\nIf you're trying to make BNY the very best that it can be with a medium to long-range mindset, this is the fundamental thing you do. The good news is we've also been delivering all along the way. That's important.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nDo you have an example outside the banking industry, software as a service? When I hang out with my tech colleagues, they'll use phrases like you're using. Is there any example or maybe another bank somewhere else around the world or a fintech, or is this something brand new?\nThis is borrowed, broadly speaking, from the technology industry. I've sat down with CEOs of large tech titan companies, and this is essentially how they've built or reorganized themselves. As you say, if you sit down with a CEO of a technology firm, it might be a fintech, a large fintech firm.\nIt might be a pure tech firm. This is how they've organized themselves. We're not doing it because it's tech and trendy. We're doing it because the nature of what we do is more platforms-like. Now, there are examples in the bank space of some banks who've little bits of their business, have gone after this. There are also examples in the broader fintech space, plenty of examples of firms who've adopted this concept because of who they are. We think it's a particularly good fit for us. I wouldn't encourage every other bank. I think if you're an investment bank, or a big trading house, or a big retail bank, this doesn't necessarily fit. We're different than that. We are a bank. We have bank form, but the nature of our businesses is quite different, and we think quite well-suited to it.\nImportantly, the early pilots that we've done, remember, we're into this thing already, and we've got a lot of measurement of how it's been going, and that's what gives us our confidence. It's not just theory.\nThen last follow-up, tech spending, 24 compared to 25. Do you feel better, worse, the same about your AI efforts?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThe zip code of tech spending, Mike, we're in the $3.8 billion range of numbers, and we have roughly earmarked a half a billion dollars for investment this year. I feel really, really good about where we are on the AI journey. We spent the last couple of years building out the infrastructure. We've got really good relationships with the West Coast, and we have a seat at the table in learning what to do and how to do it.\nI think you're going to hear a lot more from us in the coming quarters about how we deploy AI to run the company better.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nAs a broader statement, this concept of running the company better has different seasons to it. Season number one has been a lot of blocking and tackling. Season number two is really the Platforms Operating Model, implementation, and then harvesting the benefit. That lasts a few years and then AI. We think AI is very important. Within the mix of that 3.8 that Dermot mentioned, there's a gradual pivot that's occurring under the hood around uplifting basic capabilities and infrastructure, which was the past, through to making our systems better through AI. I think that evolution is quite important. It may feel like a static number, but it's actually not a static composition.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGot it. All right.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our next question, we'll move to Alex Blosstein with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Another one for you guys on operating leverage. Obviously, great progress so far. Hear you loud and clear on 2025 and more importantly, beyond. I guess in that context, how important is fee operating leverage to the firm? I know you talk about total, which is right, and NII is a helper in 2025. For whatever reason, if the fee outlook falls short, how much wiggle room do you guys have against that 1% to 2%? Again, maybe talk about the fee operating leverage as well as a metric that you care about or not.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Alex. We do talk about total, and we're very focused on delivering that consistently through the cycle.\nI also think about it in terms of fee operating leverage, and we're also focused on delivering positive fee operating leverage as well. Look, as I said in my prepared remarks, total operating leverage is the North Star. There are a number of factors that go into that: NII, fees, expenses. With each of those categories, we have multiple levers that we can toggle. We feel like we have flexibility over the inputs in terms of how we end up with that number. I think if you take last year, 288 was a very good year. Look, there was a reasonable amount ofpositive contribution to that from NII. And so we expect to deliver positive fee operating leverage through the cycle as well as total.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. All right. Super helpful.\nThen a small nuanced follow-up for you guys just around NII. We've seen stronger results in the repo business for a handful of quarters now, and I think there's still some expectation for that to normalize, but clearly, that hasn't happened yet. Maybe talk a little bit about the factors that contributed to the stronger performance in that part of the model within the quarter, but also maybe within the year. What could change that given where you are in this the environment and the outlook? What do you think is the appropriate run rate, I guess, for that contribution to NII going forward? Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon",
    "content2": "For tiered repo, look, strong performance in Q4. The only context I would give you on that, Alex, is it's roughly 5% of the overall NII.\nWhile we talk about it, it's still small in the context of the bigger number. We've invested a lot in it in the last couple of years in terms of technology, better products, being more for clients, etc. On balance, expected to grow, but it's not a meaningful part of the overall number.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just on a couple of assumptions on the financial outlook for 2025, maybe just to start with net interest revenue. Appreciate all the commentary you made, Dermot, on the factors on that. It looks like it's more based on the asset and deposit side on mix as opposed to growth in deposits and growth inarning assets.\nI just want to get your sense of all else equal, to what extent do you think you can actually grow the deposit base via all the client initiatives you have?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nFor 2024 we outperformed on the balance side. As we look out into 2025, and you talk about if you reflect on Robin's remarks in terms of starting the year, a little bit more uncertainty in post the election. For now, in the way we've come up with the guide, we expect balances to be roughly flat. The mix shift underneath, from Q4 to Q1, I expect NIBs to moderate a little bit and touch down.\nWe are in the zip code of $44-$46 billion of NIBs, what is embedded in the outlook. But we still have a reasonable amount of the book to roll off at 2% yielding assets into current market rates. You're correct, Bedell, in terms of a lot of proactive management of the balance sheet on the asset side has given us confidence around that mid-single digit guide.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Great. Then shifting to the fee side, it looks like this guidance is sort of an alpha guide. You talk about the drivers of being higher organic growth as you make progress on the platform strategy, of course, partially mitigated by current currency headwinds. But does this assume generally flat markets? That would be in line with your uncertainty commentary.\nThen if we do have very strong equity markets, say, if we're up just 10%, what would be the rough delta to revenue on that?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Brian. What I would say is roughly 5% on markets from here is about $70 million in fees. That's the rough sensitivity. To the first part of your question, we've given the last couple of years, have, as you say, really strong performance in markets. We're more neutral on market growth in terms of our guide.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Market appreciation. Yep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nVP, Banks Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nHi. Good afternoon. You managed to hold your.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nHey, David.\nHi.\nYou managed to hold your AUCA flat despite a big decline in fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. Can you remind us just how much of that $52.1 trillion might be showing off of the lag and not reflect the full decline in markets we saw later in the quarter? Either way, it seems like inflows to the asset servicing business were really strong in the quarter. Could you comment on the competitive environment that you're seeing there as well, please?\nLook, I'll start with the competitive environment. I think very pleased with where asset servicing is in terms of competitive strength, in terms of new business won over the last year. We came into 2024 with strong momentum, and we executed very well. We talked about a number of the deals that we won on prior calls. We've invested in the infrastructure.\nI think we're showing up well for clients. We exit the year feeling very good about the business. I think in some ways, asset servicing, everybody looks at asset servicing as the bellwether of the firm. We enter into 2025 with continued momentum, our right to win, and winning our share. The world's largest custodian, I think we're going to do just fine in 2025.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThere's not a ton of lag.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nVP, Banks Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Then just to clarify, you mentioned $44-46 billion of NIBs embedded in the outlook. Is that the average for the first quarter or for the full year?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nFor the full year.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nVP, Banks Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star one on your telephone keypad now. We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\n\nThomas Leddy\n\nAssistant VP Equity Research, RBC\n\nHi. Good afternoon. This is Thomas Leddy sending in for Gerard. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks we all see in the news, what are the primary risks you guys are monitoring for your businesses?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nWell, there are a lot of risks in the world at the moment. I've been asked this question a bunch of times over the course of the past few months. As you can imagine, we've got wars in essentially two different continents. We've got uncertainty in terms of policy in many countries. We've got some countries, important major economies, that have really been struggling to be able to find growth. We've just gone through the great year of elections, and so we've got a lot of new teams in place in countries around the world. There's clearly, at some point, the risk of a downturn or recession in the US.\nIt's not something that we see around the corner right now. There's the impact of higher rates. If we lock in rates at higher levels, maybe even 10 years at 5%, 5 and a quarter, who knows? Certainly possible. Those things can create complexity as well. The market's really contending with a long list of things which today are probably each fairly low probability, but there are a lot of them. The chances of something happening are probably out there. We're not in the predictions business. We're just trying to prepare. I think our platforms give us the ability to help clients navigate these uncertainties. That's clearly our focus. If you had to pick a couple, you're going to say geopolitical risk, probably curve risk, absolute levels of issuance, which is true for several different countries, and cyber risk.\nNow, on the flip side of that, I think it's important to mention it. We're a capital markets-oriented company. We're a financial services platform company. We're pro-growth. We benefit from growth. It's very encouraging, including particularly here in the US with the new incoming administration, to hear this pro-growth mantra because growth is, A, important for our business, and B, it enables so many other things. On the flip side of the risks, I think there is this undertone of this sort of sense of possibility of the year, which we certainly haven't lost sight of all the while we're managing for the risks that are out there.\n\nThomas Leddy\n\nAssistant VP Equity Research, RBC\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nSticking to the theme of many cross-currents, can you give us some color on how increased trading volatility attributed to the dynamic interest rate environment might impact your servicing fee revenue growth?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nWell, definitely, if you just look at last year, if you just pick one business in particular, clearance and collateral management, which really benefits from increased treasury issuance, increased volatility, clients doing more activity, and we just process much more volume on the platform. When you hear us talking about increased volume, we mean talking about increased fees. Last year, there were a number of times where we had records and records on records in terms of what's going through the pipes. I think treasury issuance has been a real tailwind for us over the last couple of years.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThere are two things that I'd add just quickly on composition of revenues because to the prior question, the absolute levels of assets do matter in some parts of our business. To your question, transaction volumes matter. Elsewhere, we have revenues from direct software sales. That's a growing part of who we are and part of this sort of platforms concept. If you just take something like fixed income, and this goes to the gearing to capital markets that we laid out in one of our trends pages in the presentation, take fixed income. What's happening in public markets, private markets, in credit touches so many of our businesses: our clearing business, our collateral management business, our asset servicing business, our corporate trust business, our debt capital markets business, our investment management fixed income business, our investment management LDI business, our cash strategies.\nThe firm across the breadth of who we are is really able to capitalize in a lot of different ways back to this point on growth and activity.\n\nThomas Leddy\n\nAssistant VP Equity Research, RBC\n\nThank you. That's helpful. Thank you guys for taking my question.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just want to circle back on Wove. I think, Dermot, you mentioned, and maybe I missed this. You said you had a revenue guide. I saw the $75 million of exit rate annualized in 2024. Did I miss the actual guide for 2025, or is that the onboarding point? Maybe if you can just talk about the just general progress at Wove.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nIncremental revenue for 2025 of $60-70. I would say we're very pleased. We are currently 36 clients on the platform, 41 signed contracts. In the prepared remarks, we talked about the proliferation of products that we announced at Insight last summer. So becoming more sophisticated and clients really liking what they're seeing.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Then 67 is incremental to the 30 of 2024. Is that right?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah. That's correct.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Okay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Be well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast.\nA replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day."

I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, BNY\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference our Financial Highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com, and I'll note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nInformation about these statements and non-GAAP measures is available in the Earnings Press Release, Financial Supplement, and Financial Highlights Presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 12 July 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThanks, Marius. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before Dermot reviews the financials in greater detail, I'd like to start with a few remarks about our progress in the quarter. In short, we delivered another quarter of improved financial performance with positive operating leverage on the back of solid fee growth and continued expense discipline. We continued to make tangible progress on our path to be more for our clients, to run our company better, and to power our culture. Last month we celebrated our company's 240th anniversary with our people and many of our clients.\nEven with this rich history of operating across four centuries, I believe that our best days remain ahead of us. That bank, with around half a million dollars of capital in 1784, today oversees roughly $50 trillion in assets and powers platforms across payments, security, settlement, wealth, investments, collateral trading, and more for clients in over 100 markets around the world. As the world changes and global financial markets evolve, so do we. Earlier this year in January, you heard us lay out our strategy, which maps out what we need to get done and how we need to do it.\nLast month, we introduced changes to our logo and simplified and modernized our company brand to BNY to improve the market's familiarity with who we are and what we do. This rebranding better aligns the perception of our company to the substance of what we're doing to unlock our full potential as 1BNY. Now referring to page two of the Financial Highlights presentation, BNY delivered solid EPS growth as well as pre-tax margin, and ROTCE expansion, once again on the back of positive operating leverage.\nIn the second quarter, reported earnings per share of $1.52 were up 16% year-over-year, and excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.51 were up 9%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year-over-year. This included 5% growth in investment services fees led by continued strength in clearance and collateral management, asset servicing, and treasury services, as well as 16% growth in foreign exchange revenue. Net interest income decreased by 6%.\nExpenses of $3.1 billion were down 1% year-over-year, including notable items. Expenses were up 1%, reflecting further investments in our people and technology, while we also continued to realize greater efficiencies. Margin was 33%, and in what is seasonally our strongest quarter, we reported a return on tangible common equity of 25%, 24% excluding notable items. These financial results were against the backdrop of a relatively constructive operating environment, the market calling for a gradual and shallow easing of policy rates, inflation pressures easing, and investor confidence growing.\nOn average, equity market values increased while fixed income markets finished slightly lower compared to Q1. A couple of weeks ago, the Federal Reserve released the results of its annual bank stress test, which once again showcased our resilient business model and our strength to support clients through extreme stress scenarios. The test confirmed that our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at the regulatory floor of 2.5% and we increased our quarterly common dividend by 12% to $0.47 per share starting this quarter.\nIn May, the transition to T+1 settlement in the US, Canadian, and Mexican markets represented one of the more significant market structure changes that our industry has seen in a couple of decades. BNY's critical role in the financial system gives us the opportunity to help clients through major shifts like this, further strengthening their trust in us and deepening our relationships with them. By running the company better, we are starting to capitalize on BNY's truly powerful combination of security services, market and wealth services, and our investments and wealth businesses to serve our clients more effectively across the entire financial life cycle.\nAs an example, this past quarter BNY was awarded a significant mandate by a premier global asset manager with over $100 billion in assets under management. We were selected based on our ability to deliver custody fund servicing, ETF and digital fund services, treasury services, and Pershing. Our holistic offering will power their future growth strategy. In another example, AIA, the Pan-Asian Life Insurance Group, announced a new collaboration with BNY and BlackRock as AIA transforms its investment platform.\nAIA has announced that they will implement BNY's specialized investment operations, data management services, and technology with BlackRock's Aladdin to create a connected and scalable ecosystem to support the company's evolving investment activities. We also continue to be pleased with the growing interest in our wealth advisory platform Wove. Global Finance recently named Wove as one of the top three global financial innovations as part of its annual innovators awards for 2024.\nAt Insight, Pershing's annual flagship wealth services conference in June, we announced a suite of new solutions on the platform: Wove Investor, a one-stop client portal; Wove Data, a cloud data platform designed for financial professionals at wealth management firms; and Portfolio Solutions, a set of enhancements to the platform that will help advisers move more efficiently from researching investment products, aligning them to a client's risk objectives, and adding them to a portfolio.\nWe also introduced a new 1BNY offering that enables clients to easily access multiple BNY capabilities, including our managed accounts platform, asset allocation and manager selection, investment management products, customized tax solutions, the interoperable Wove platform for advisors, and custody and clearing services from Pershing, through a comprehensive unified package leveraging the breadth of BNY to make clients' wealth advisors' lives easy, and we have proof points.\nFor example, a fast-growing full-service regional bank recently selected Pershing to provide custody and clearing services for its private wealth business, but they are also adopting advisory, Dreyfus Cash Management, Direct Indexing, and private banking. As we've said many times, our culture and people are a critical part of being more for our clients and running our company better. We are pleased to see that our actions are enabling us to be a top talent destination for recent graduates and experienced leaders alike.\nThis summer, we're welcoming our largest ever intern and analyst classes, a total of over 3,500 individuals chosen from over 150,000 applications, and we recently announced several new appointments to our leadership team. Shannon Hobbs, our new Chief People Officer, joined us in June. Leanne Russell will join us in September as Chief Information Officer and Global Head of Engineering. Jose Minaya will also join us in September lead BNY's investments and wealth to wrap up halfway through the year.\nWe're pleased with the progress that we have made and how it is reflected in both improved financial performance to date as well as our building momentum. One of my favorite quotes comes from Alexander Hamilton, our founder, who famously said that he attributed his success not to genius but to hard work. We have been hard at work and we've laid a solid foundation. Our team is in full execution mode and we're starting to demonstrate the power of our franchise and of operating as 1BNY for our clients and our shareholders. With that, over to you Dermot.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Picking up on page three of the presentation, I'll start with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 4%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees on the back of higher market values, net new business, and higher client activity. Investment management and performance fees were flat. Firmwide AUCA of 49.5 trillion were up 6% year-over-year and assets under management of $2 trillion were up 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values.\nForeign exchange revenue increased by 16%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $169 million in the quarter on the back of strong client activity in our fixed income and equity trading business, and net interest income decreased by 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix partially offset by higher interest rates. Expenses were down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items primarily in the prior year.\nThe increase from higher investments, employee merit increases, and higher revenue-related expenses was partially offset by efficiency savings from running our company better. Notable items in Q2 of this year primarily included an expense benefit from a reduction in the FDIC's special assessment, which was largely offset by severance expense. There was no provision for credit losses in the quarter. As Robin highlighted earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.52, up 16% year-over-year, a pre-tax margin of 33%, and a return on tangible common equity of 25% excluding notable items.\nEarnings per share were $1.51, up 9% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 33% and our return on tangible common equity was 24%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.8%. Average assets increased by 2% sequentially on the back of deposit growth, and Tier 1 capital increased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings partially offset by capital returns to common shareholders. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.4%.\nThe quarter-over-quarter improvement reflects lower risk weighted assets coming off the temporary increase in risk weighted assets at the end of the previous quarter, and CET1 capital increased by 2% sequentially. Over the course of the second quarter, we returned over $900 million of capital to our common shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 81%. Year to date, we returned 107% of our earnings to our common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Turning to liquidity, the consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 115% and our consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio was 132%.\nNext, Net Interest Income and the underlying balance sheet trends on page five. Net Interest Income of over $1 billion was down 6% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by the benefit of reinvesting maturing fixed rate securities in higher yielding alternatives. Average deposit balances increased by 2% sequentially. Interest bearing deposits grew by 3% and non interest bearing deposits declined by 2% in the quarter. Average interest earning assets were up 2% quarter-over-quarter.\nOur average investment securities portfolio balances increased by 3% and our cash and reverse repo balances increased by 1%. Average loan balances were up 4%. Turning to our business segments starting on page 6. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion flat year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 3% year-over-year. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business.\nWe continue to see strong momentum in ETF servicing with AUCA of over $2 trillion, up more than 50% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced up over 20% year-on-year. This growth reflects both higher market values as well as client inflows, which included a large ETF mandate in Ireland from a leading global asset manager in alternatives. Fund launches for the quarter continued the recent activity in private markets. Investment services fees for alternatives were up mid single digits, reflecting growth from both new and existing clients.\nIn issuance services. Investment services fees were up 1%, reflecting net new business across both corporate trust and depository receipts, partially offset by the normalization of elevated fees associated with corporate actions in depository receipts in the second quarter of last year. We're particularly pleased to see the investments and new leaders in our corporate trust platform beginning to bear fruit against the backdrop of a significant pickup in CLO issuance. In recent months, we've been moving up the ranks and improved our market share as trustee for CLOs by about 4 percentage points over the past 12 months to 20% in Q2.\nIn the segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 16% year-over-year and net interest income was down 11%. Expenses of $1.6 billion were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting efficiency savings partially offset by higher investments, employee merit increases, and higher revenue-related expenses. Pre-tax income was $688 million, a 7% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin expanded to 31%. Next, Markets and Wealth Services, on page 7. Markets and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year.\nIn Pershing, investment services fees were up 2%, reflecting higher market values and client activity partially offset by the impact of business lost in the prior year. Net new assets were negative $23 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of the aforementioned lost business. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 2% annualized net new asset growth in the second quarter, and we renewed a multi-year agreement with Osaic, one of the nation's largest providers of wealth management solutions.\nPershing has supported Osaic since its founding in 1988, and we are proud to help the company drive its growth strategy for years to come. Client demand for Wove continues to be strong in the quarter. We signed 12 additional client agreements, the pipeline continues to grow, and we are on track to meet our goal of $30 million to $40 million realized revenue in 2024. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes.\nUS securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong throughout the quarter, supported by a growing market and active trading, and we are excited about the opportunity to do even more for clients. Having realigned Pershing's institutional solutions business to clearance and collateral management, we can offer clients a choice across a continuum of clearance, settlement, and financing solutions for those at self-clear as well as those seeking capital and operational efficiency through outsourcing.\nThis allows us to not only deepen our relationships with clients, but also drive continued revenue growth, and in Treasury Services, Investment Services fees increased by 10% primarily reflecting net new business and higher client activity. Net Interest Income for the segment overall was down 1% year-over-year. Expenses of $833 million were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year-over-year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin.\nMoving on to Investment and Wealth Management on page. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $821 million, up 1% year-over-year. In our investment management business, revenue was down 1% reflecting the mix of AUM flows and lower equity investment income, and capital gains partially offset by higher market values. In wealth management, revenue increased by 3% reflecting higher market values partially offset by changes in product mix.\nExpenses of $668 million were down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting our work to drive efficiency savings and lower revenue-related expenses partially offset by employee merit increases and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $149 million, up 15% year-over-year, representing a pre-tax margin of 18%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 7% year-over-year in the quarter, while we saw $2 billion of net inflows into long-term active strategies with continued strength in fixed income and LDI partially offset by net outflows in active equity, and multi-asset strategies.\nWe saw $4 billion of net outflows from index strategies and $7 billion of net outflows from short-term strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $308 billion increased by 8% year-over-year reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the other segment. I'll close with a couple of comments on our outlook for the full year 2024. Starting with NII, I'm pleased to report that the first half of the year came in slightly better than we had expected as we saw the decline in non-interest-bearing deposits decelerate and we continue to grow interest-bearing deposits.\nWhile we are cautiously optimistic, we remain humble as we head into the seasonally low summer months, and for now, we will therefore keep our NII outlook for the full year 2024 unchanged, down 10% year-over-year. Regarding expenses, our goal remains to keep expenses excluding notable items for the full year 2024 roughly flat. As Robin put it earlier, BNY is in execution mode and we're embracing the hard work ahead of us. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be between 23% and 24%. Lastly, we continue to expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\nOur board of directors declared our 12% increased common dividend for Q3 and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program. As always, we are calibrating the pace of our buybacks and considering various factors such as our capital management targets, the macroeconomic and interest rate environment, as well as the size of our balance sheet.\nTo wrap up, we enter the second half of the year on the back of solid fee growth, a better than expected NII performance to date, and continued expense discipline, which gives us incremental confidence in our ability to drive positive operating leverage in 2024. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Our first question is coming from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nGood morning, Ken.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Just like to ask Dermot about that NII humbleness for the second half. Can you just walk us through what the moving pieces would be, including the seasonality that you mentioned and any other things that might have been over earning in the NII in Q1 so that you would seemingly in your maintained guidance still expect a meaningful ramp down in NII, which I don't think is what seems to be the base case given how well the balance sheet has held up so far as you pointed out relative to your expectations? Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThanks for the question, Ken. I guess the best way to answer the question is a little bit to, in some ways, look back at last year where Q1, Q2 typically strong quarters for us, Q3. Typically a seasonally lower quarter. Summer months, clients taking their foot off the gas in terms of activity, and then we pick back up again in Q4. Now, as you've seen from this quarter's numbers and the first half overall, we're very pleased with the performance.\nI guess we've outperformed our expectations for the first half, and that's in large part due to underlying activity within our core businesses. In my remarks, I particularly called out Corporate Trust where we saw like elevated activity in the CLO space, which in turn drives deposits. When our core businesses are doing well, which they've all performed well, that has a knock on impact in the number of deposits that we have, and so we outperformed our expectations in the first half. Notwithstanding that, when I look out at the rest of the year.\nWhen we gave the guidance of down 10% in January, the market at that time was roughly calling for six rate cuts. Now we're in the middle of the summer. We had a slowdown in inflation print yesterday. Let's see how Jay speaks on Monday and how he guides out of Jackson Hole and into a September potential rate cut. We take all of those levers, and we just kind of say for now there's no point in me changing guidance to change guidance again in September or October at the next call. We're cautiously optimistic. I think I used the word last year in March askew.\nWe're playing for the best outcome. But we do expect Q3 to be somewhat seasonally quieter, and that's why we didn't change our guidance.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, and then that's the follow-up just on the size of the deposit. You're just expecting the size of the deposit base to decline or is it the mix, or just trying to understand like what pieces of it do, would revert given that seasonality?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nWhen I think about deposits, I think there are three components to it. One is interest bearing deposits where we outperformed plan, NIBs where we outperformed plan, and so pleased with that. That really reflects clients showing up in a different way with us and we showing up in a different way with clients. Good. Then the third thing, and I've talked about this a number of times on previous calls, really the strength of the collaboration and teamwork between our treasurer, our CIO, and our Global Liquidity Solutions platform where we think about liquidity as a $1.4 trillion ecosystem.\nWe've been very much in offense mode this quarter, and our GLS team has really shown up in a positive way, and we've really managed to gather good liquidity-friendly deposits, which is kind of fueling the growth of our balance sheet, and that's allowed us to do more loans. I think in terms of specifically to your question, it's both. I think the overall balance will come down and as a consequence, I would expect NIBs from here to grind a little bit lower, which is the main driver of the NII change.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nRight. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nHi.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much. You alluded to the higher clearance and collateral management, higher clearance volumes. I'm just curious if you can parse out how much of that is just clients being more active during more active Q2 versus winning new business and organic growth. It just might help for the thoughts on the go forward and how to model things.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThanks, Glenn. I think it's a combination of both clients are for sure doing more. Rate volatility in Q2 was there for all to sees as a consequence more activity in the treasury market, more treasury issuance, which feeds volumes. Overall, very healthy volumes, and we have a high margin scaled business, which the platform was able to benefit from that increased level of activity. Also, I think, as we did last year, we continue to innovate for clients in the domestic market.\nAs we said on our January call, the international business is also a key growth opportunity for us. Our teams are innovating and developing new products and solutions for our clients internationally. I think it's a combination of all the factors that we've talked about on previous calls, kind of showed up as a nice tailwind for us. This quarter and for Clearance and Collateral Management, I think I do expect that trend to continue in the near term.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Dermot. You piqued my interest in the opening remarks. You all talked about T+1 coming in into the market and that helping you helping help clients. I'm curious, now that it's built, now that it's in the run rate, just a couple of quickies of is there a cost runoff now or is that not big enough? Does T+1 come with lower spread for you, but does it free up capital with more frequent settlement? I'm just curious what the net impact of it all is.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nHey, Glenn, I would describe it in terms of like the raw PL impact, which is the second part of your question, is really pretty de minimis. We spent a bunch of time preparing for this over the course of the past couple of years. It wasn't like there was some big hump in the cost curve in order to really do it. We worked the process over time. For us, I think the biggest opportunity associated with T+1 is whenever there's a market inflection like this, and this was one of the more significant ones. We're looking ahead to treasury clearing as another good example of something like that.\nIt gives us the opportunity to get closer to our clients. It creates uncertainty for our clients. How is it going to work? They need help navigating it. The combination of uncertainty and a need for assistance is really the macro opportunity for us, and we've leaned into that. We'll continue leaning into those types of market changes, again with treasury clearing being another good example. I would say overall, these types of changes create things that create more efficiency in the market, things that can reduce risk in the market, and things that improve efficiency.\nSure, they do sometimes call on more of our products and solutions, which of course is great. It's also just a good thing for the market to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of market operation. I think over time, we're also a beneficiary of that.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nFollow up. Dermot, for you on NII, I guess in response to Ken's question, you talked about Fed policy and that having an impact, remind us the positioning of the balance sheet. If the Fed does decide to cut rates come September and we get 100 to 150 basis points of cuts, remind us how the balance sheet will behave, how we should think about NII in that backdrop.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThanks for the question. I would give a couple of different perspectives on that is one. Cumulative betas are roughly unchanged quarter-over-quarter, which feels like I really believe our book to be fairly priced. As you will remember, our book is largely institutional. We pass on the rates and so cumulative betas are in good shape. For the dollar portfolio, roughly low 80s, 80 range, and then for Euros and sterling, we're in the high 50s, low 60s.\nWe do a range of scenarios, and at the beginning of the year we're positioned roughly, we're roughly flat. If Chairman Powell cuts in September and then cuts again, I guess, which is the general view of the market, we're basically NII. Okay. It doesn't really impact the book that much. For small moves, we're well positioned in terms of expectation.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nUnderstood. Separately, I guess maybe Robin, for you, just in terms of the fee revenue momentum that you talked about [inaudible]. Just give us a sense around, what are the drivers we should be thinking as we think about the medium term outlook on fee revenue outside of just pure markets activity that could drive fees in a world where NII might be stable to lower as we think about momentum on their positive outlook.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nSure. Look, revenue growth in any given year is somewhat market dependent because of course, interest rates, equity, fixed income markets, volumes, volatility, that that stuff all moves around. Our strategy has been, of course, to fuel the organic growth of the company, but also to try to position our businesses to be able to respond as well as they can to growth tailwinds that exist just in markets. In answer to Ken, to the question earlier on around the treasury market, we've positioned that business to be able to benefit from what we think is a secular growth in activity in the US Treasury market.\nThat's a place where we're benefiting, yes, from the market. We're also benefiting from the investments that Dermot detailed. As we go through what's next for our fee growth, we talked a lot about our 1BNY campaign quarters ago and we talked last quarter and in January about the fact that we're sort of operationalizing more and more what started off as a movement of 1BNY into referrals, into new targets, into our commercial model, and our chief commercial officer joining and really then getting into the client coverage, the practices, the integrated solutions which we talked about in our prepared remarks, the fact that we can now bundle individual products into true solutions for clients.\nThere are a lot of levers on the fee growth. We've been working very methodically through our plan to build momentum in that space, but also to position the business to be able to take advantage of macro things going on in the market.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermot.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nGood morning, Steven.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI guess wanted to build on that earlier line of questioning, but really focusing more on repo activity. It's been a big area of investor focus. You've certainly benefited from recent strength on the repo side, and I was hoping you could potentially quantify, quantify the benefit year-on-year from elevated repo activity, and just longer term, like how you're thinking about the durability of the recent repo strength and what are some of the factors supporting that view.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, BNY\n\nThanks for the question, Steven.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nI would say in terms of year-on-year activity, it's not a cleared repo. It's not a game changer for us in terms of the overall year-on-year NII story. Overall in its totality, it makes up about 5% of our NII today. I think I would just echo follow on from Robin's answer to the last question, in terms of, it's a product, clients want it. We are meeting them where they want to be, we're innovating. This comes under the $1.4 trillion liquidity ecosystem. Lila Day runs that business, does a terrific job for us. In the cleared repo business specifically, we're a top three provider.\nWe have a large installed client base who are looking for products, and we can meet them with our cleared repo product. It's just another tool in our toolbox. I would say again, we're positioned, we're investing, we're a scale player, and we can provide automated solutions for our clients. I do expect that business to continue to grow, but in terms of the year-over-year, to your specific question, it's not a material driver of the year-over-year change.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nSteven, I would add one thing to it, which is just remember that in the context of our business, we're really the only global solution provider in the space because we're scaled in Asia, we're scaled in Europe, we're scaled in the United States. In a world where folks are looking at repo as a collateral tool and an investment tool, the opportunity to be able to help clients navigate the whole world in this product, provide the seamless connectivity between repo, margin, and collateral management, the connectivity to other things that we do.\nThere's a real appeal, to use Dermot's phrase again, about meeting clients where they are. There's a real appeal here for clients in terms of the breadth of what we can offer, but also the innovation that he referred to earlier on in the call where we're creating these new solutions. This is another example along with the US Treasury market. There are so many others in our business of saying this. There's a macro evolution going on and we have the opportunity to participate in that as long as we're front footed with clients and as long as we're innovating.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for all that color. Just for my follow up on the Pershing business, I know that the core underlying strength has been obscured to some degree by some large client departures. I was hoping you can give some perspective on what some of the core organic growth trends look like in that business, what the pipeline looks like in that business, given some of the recent excitement around the Wove platform and the offering. Have we lapped those headwinds at this point or is there still some remaining pressure on the comm?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nOkay, so I would say nobody is happier to see the ongoing deconversion of the client to come to an end. We expect that to be fully out of the portfolio by Q3. As I've said on previous calls, we believe in our ability to earn our way through that deconversion. It happens in life. I think the team has been very resilient in terms of earning their way through it and growing. In my prepared remarks I talked about the re-sign of Osaic on a several-year contract. We're very pleased about that. You take a step back and you look at where we were 12 months ago.\nWe just came off the Insight conference in Florida where we announced Wove. 12 months later, we've announced a new suite of products to support the Wove. We have signed 21 clients so far this year for Wove. The momentum is building. The clients like it. I reiterated my guidance on prepared remarks about the $30 to 40 million of revenue for this year, and then just I'll remind you that we're a $3 trillion player in the wealth tech space.\nNumber one with broker dealers, top three with RIAs, and in previous quarters, I've kind of guided mid single digits of underlying core growth through the cycle. We continue to believe that notwithstanding, on any given quarter it may be slower or better, but we believe we're in good shape and that there's good momentum in what is a very, very large market and in which we're a very big player.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nVery helpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, Robin, and Dermot. Thanks for taking my questions. We saw the ECB cut rates this quarter, and while I know euro is a huge exposure for you in terms of your deposit base, curious about what impact you saw that on your deposit costs in that currency, and maybe how does that experience and the market reaction inform your expectations for beta and customer behavior around rate cuts in other currencies?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nI would say overall euros is roughly 10% of the total portfolio. In answer to the earlier question, I think we feel very well positioned. For the range of outcomes that the forward curve is implying in euros, sterling, and dollars. We prepare for it, we talk about it a lot, and so feel like the way the CIO book is currently set up where we still have a reasonable amount of securities rolling off into higher yielding assets.\nI just feel like the combination of where our deposit book is in terms of our betas to reiterate again for dollars low 80s, sterling, and euros high 60s and the CIO book still room to grow and so on rate cuts in terms of how we position the book, we're broadly symmetric in terms of on the rate cut side. I think Chairman Powell has done a good job of telegraphing to the market how he wants to do it. I don't think it's going to be a volatile move in rates when it happens. He's allowed us time to position and manage and get into the right place. I think overall, I feel very good about where we're at.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, but what I was asking, I appreciate that. What I was trying to understand was the actual experience in the actual marketplace beyond like the expectation did the 50% to 60 beta, I think you said, in euros, did that hold when the cut went through and did you actually experience that?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nSpecifically, yes. We did experience that and it behaved as expected.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nExcellent. Thank you. Thank you for that, Dermot. I appreciate that. Issuer services, very solid. You flagged some CLO trustee gains on the back of a market that's seen solid volume. Could you help us understand maybe how much of the strength and the growth that you saw in that line was attributed to that which I assume would be in the Corporate Trust business? Then maybe how to think about the depository receipts fees, just so we're thinking about the right way to baseline and move forward with our models?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nSure. Look, Corporate Trust, I think, is for us a good opportunity, a very good opportunity. I actually talked about it at some length at the RBC conference in March when I was chatting with Gerard Cassidy. I think over the last number of years, Corporate Trust for BNY is a business that's been under invested in both technology and leadership. In both Robin and I's prepared remarks, we did emphasize leadership as being a continuous change for us. We've made a couple of very important hires over the last 12 months in Corporate Trust. We have new leadership overseeing the business.\nIt's that investment in technology products leadership that is showing up. Specifically, we've doubled our activity in CLOs over the last 12 months. We've improved our market share, and as Robin said, a couple in an answer to another question, we really want to position Corporate Trust as a business that really can take the advantage of scale, a lot of manual processes, a lot of room for AI, a lot of room for digitization, and we can improve the operating leverage of that business. We can improve how we show up for clients, client service.\nWe feel like in Corporate Trust specifically, we have a lot to play for Depository Receipts, we have good market share. We punch above our weight, and we expect that to continue.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nMorning, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nTwo quick questions. One just to wrap up a little bit on the T+1 discussion earlier. Could you give us a sense of how much did T+1 drive sequential revenue growth this quarter? Can you give us a sense as to if there's enough revenue growth you're expecting from this to impact the expense ratio since you've already made the investments? Then I have a follow up on Wove. Thanks.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nHi, Betsy, it's Dermot. The point I would make about T+1 is not so much a revenue or expense topic. It really is. It speaks to resilience as a commercial attribute point that we make on behalf of BNY in terms of it's been a large-scale infrastructure change that's been coming to the market over the last couple of years. As we're a key player in the financial market infrastructure, it's very important that we execute that to an A-plus standard. What I would say is BNY has shown up for clients in delivering an A-plus execution of a very big project. It's not really about revenue or expenses.\nIt's really about delivering a complicated change project for our clients and the ecosystem at large. That's really, I think, the point we're trying to make on T+1.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. I just think if you're in a better spot than others, you could pick up some incremental share on the back of that. That's maybe a couple conference calls from here. All right, then separately on Wove. I know you mentioned that you added new clients to Wove. I just wanted to understand, is this new clients of the firm or this is clients who had been yours for a while and they moved to Wove?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nI would say it's both. I guess the questions that we've had on previous calls, Betsy, are we cannibalizing existing clients? The answer to that is most definitely no. I think it speaks to the point of us innovating. Wove is a very big investment for us in terms of technology over multiple years. Existing clients like the fact that we're willing to put money to work for them and give them better solutions. As a consequence of that, we had over 1,500 people show up to Wove in Florida last year and Nashville this year. For those that are there, there's real excitement.\nAs Robin said in his prepared remarks, it's winning awards. There's a flywheel effect of, oh, wow, BNY is showing up in the wealth tech space and delivering new solutions for us. We want to see what they have to do. The network effect of that shouldn't be underestimated.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nBetsy, let me double-click on it for one second as well, because when we started on the Wove journey and we announced it, as Dermot said last year, it was initially really focused on what that singular KPI of making advisors' lives easier. It was a technology front end that went from wealth planning and helped clients with wealth planning all the way through to portfolio construction and then getting into market.\nNow, what's evolved since then and what we talked a lot about this year, one year later in the Wove journey was the fact that now we have the opportunity to link all of these other BNY capabilities to, to be able to deliver to our Pershing and Wove clients. You can be a clearing and custody client of Pershing. You can be an advisor taking advantage of that initial set of tooling from Wove. What you can now also do is you can have that ability to manage and aggregate data, including across multiple custodians. We can connect you to models in the investment management space.\nBy the way, we can fulfill those models because we've got active equity, indexing, and all these capabilities that come from BNY Investments. Wove is becoming a bit more of a delivery vehicle for the various capabilities of the firm. It's also opening up the aperture of how clients of Pershing think about us in terms of our ability to solve other problems for them. Banking as a service, which is a Treasury Services business, but we stimulate the conversation for that because people see us as being more than what we used to be in Pershing.\nWe also, to your question, are attracting people who don't necessarily need the clearing and custody service, but who want to take advantage of these other components. Which is why Dermot said both, because it's both and delivering the breadth of 1BNY.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThank you, Betsy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi. Could you put a little more meat on the 1BNY initiative in terms of products for customers? You're talking about more bundled solutions thematically. I understand it and I guess you're having higher core servicing fees, but connecting from the higher core servicing fees from the high level. Let's bundle, let's have everyone work together. I'm just trying to connect the dots a little more.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nUnderstood, Mike. You'd asked me a question. It's probably about more than a year ago now, where you had essentially challenged the fact that in order for something like 1BNY to be successful, it can't just be hearts and minds. It's got to be deeply operationalized. We talked at that time about some of our future ambitions for how to really bring it home. The way that I would now answer your question is we are rallying around the three strategic pillars that Dermot and I both have talked about a bunch. And this is about being more for our clients.\nThat's not just words anymore. It's not just a movement. It's not just appealing to our people to be able to be client obsessed. It's about elevating the effectiveness of our sales organization and the process driving client service differently than we used to. It's about the innovative new products as we were just talking about Wove. That's a good example. We are being more for clients in that example, and we are also delivering the whole of the company.\nIt is a great 1BNY example. Pershing, which used to be somewhat off to the side in the company a few years back, now very much at the heart and benefiting from that integration with all of the other capabilities that we have. Then you hit on a critical word, which is solutions. Because that next journey, to use the term that Dermot used earlier on, of meeting our clients where they are, it's not just about us selling a bunch of great products and client platforms to our clients. It's about the fact that when we look at the challenges that our clients have, they actually need things that cut across multiple parts of our company.\nRather than going in disconnected and showing them individually and trying to have them piece it all together, we can now show up and we can actually show them these solutions which bring all the componentry together to solve their needs. Both Dermot and I talked a bit about that in our prepared remarks.\nThat's the next level of the maturity of that 1BNY work that we're really doing that's evolving from an initiative and hearts and minds to making everything that we're doing in our commercial organization, the sales practices, the sales targets, the way that we're bringing people together, the account management process, the client service, the digital delivery of tooling, and the way that we're thinking about everything that equips our salespeople to be effective, the cross-training.\nWe're bringing all of those things together and maturing our commercial model. Over time, we think there's a lot of value both in the process and in what we're actually delivering to clients.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nWhen you wrap it all up, I mean, what wallet share do you have per customer today? Where was it a few years ago? Where do you hope that to go, just in terms of a zip code of expectations?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nI think some of those metrics, as we think about ways in which to show you that story more over time, some of those metrics will be in our future. Right now, I'm going to point you to two things. There are a whole bunch of inputs. I described a bunch of them, and I think over the course of the past couple of years, we've been trying to really show the key inputs which we think are the leading indicators for performance. Then you have to actually look at the fee growth result. You saw that in Q1, you've seen that in Q2, and that's some of the output.\nThe story that Dermot and I are both trying to describe is a story of a maturing of a process, but with still a distance to go and opportunity ahead.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY",
    "content2": "Mike, just to put a metric on us, it's just to give an indication because we need to mature the metrics as we proceduralize all the strategic comments that Robin has just outlined. Year-over-year, the amount of business that we've won that touches more than one line of business has increased by 1/3, albeit a very low base. I wouldn't draw too much into the metric, but just the fact that we are showing up in a different way and clients are buying products and services from more than one line of business because we can deliver integrated solutions.\nThat's the key, that over time we'd be able to track that and communicate that in a more objective way as that strategy takes root.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nUnderstood. When all is said and done, core servicing fees over time, whether it's aspirational or a specific target, where should core servicing fee growth be?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nMy answer to that, which I recognize is a little bit unsatisfying, is we're going to keep pointing you back to the positive operating leverage, which is really how we're focusing for our own growth. We think that each quarter, each year has a different composition to it, but higher fee growth over time is a very important part of that combination of solutions. Any individual quarter or year is going to have a different composition. We're controlling the things that we can control, albeit we're stoking the engine for growth of organic fees over time.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in on this. I wanted to touch on expenses and operating leverage. Expenses up a little bit year to date, year-over-year. Sounds like you guys are still targeting flat expenses for the year despite the fact that revenues are obviously shaking out a little bit better than you hoped. Maybe walk us through where you see the flex in the expense base to keep it kind of that flattish run rate. I guess more importantly, you guys set a target for pre-tax margin to be at 33% plus recently.\nYou're doing 33% this quarter and obviously don't want to get too carried away with a single quarter, but it feels like you have an ability to reset the bar. Maybe talk a little bit about what that plus within the 33 could look like a couple of years out.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nThanks, Alex. I guess I would start with the margin part of it. We need to consistently do it, and so one quarter doesn't a medium term target make. I'm very pleased that we've done it. Now I want to see it next quarter, the following quarter, the following quarter. Execution is key, and just showing up in a very disciplined way every day is really important to delivering out that. We don't want to be known as a one hit wonder. While I'm pleased that we've managed to do it, I want to see it repeated on a consistent basis. That's what I would say on margin, on expenses.\nYou and I talked in Madrid a few weeks back at your conference, and I said a little bit like we're in the zip code of flat for the year. It's all about running the company better. It's very important that we have 53,000 people wrapped around the same aspiration that we as a leadership team have. Everybody's focused on doing it. There is a real momentum on running the company better, which is the input to how we show up with expenses being where they are as opposed to a top-down approach. Very different cultural experience within the firm in terms of how we're doing it.\nThe reason why we're a little bit above trend in the first couple of quarters this year is what I said to you at the conference is revenue-related expenses. I anchor that in overall where we are for positive operating leverage in the year. In my remarks, I said I feel optimistic about delivering positive operating leverage for the year, which, in a down 10% NII environment, BNY hasn't really executed to that level before. Also, Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter for us, which would feed the margin of 33%. I feel good about expenses, I feel good about flat, notwithstanding there's pressure to that from a revenue-related expense part.\nWe're very determined to deliver positive operating leverage to our shareholders this year.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nExcellent. Great. My second quick question around the balance sheet. There's a lot of discussion around deposits, but I wanted to zone in on the asset side of the balance sheet for a second. We've seen pretty nice growth from you guys in both the securities portfolio and loans sequentially. Could you spend a minute on sort of the sources where you're investing and then your outlook and maybe deployment, deploying some of the liquidity that seems to be perhaps a bit more sticky into both loan growth and securities.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nLook, feel very proud of the CIO book team, what they've accomplished over the last couple of years, which is really from Q3 of 2022. It really has been just a terrific collaboration within the firm. We're deploying where we think we can see opportunity. Our CIO likes to use the word nibbling. We're seeing where the next leg is, and we're deploying where we think we can see opportunity to continue to grow NII. It's opportunistic at the moment, but we feel overall very good about that aspect of it. We're still rolling off the book into higher yielding securities.\nWe're picking up the 200 basis points, and so that's feeding NII. Then on loan growth, I think the GLS team is doing a really good job of getting very liquidity friendly deposits, which allows us to extend credit to our clients. I think we're showing up in a different way to our clients, who are important to us, and extending our balance sheet to them as they look to buy products in more than one line of business, where we need the balance sheet to support business activities, that's what we're doing. It's a kind of a strategic tool in our kit for doing that.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAwesome. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nGood morning, Dermot. Good morning, Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nGood morning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nDermot, can you share with us now that we're entering into a phase with monetary policy of quantitative tightening easing up a bit? You guys obviously have been through QE. You've seen the initial stages of QT. Do you have any thoughts on how this could affect your balance sheet over the next 12 to 18 months? Have you guys done any type of modeling to see what kind of effect the QT as it shrinks could have on your balance sheet?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nWe do a lot of work on that, Gerard, and look, CCAR forces us to do that work as well. Rates up, rates down, quantitative tightening, quantitative easing. We look at it every which way to Sunday. The thing that I would remind you and everybody who's listening in is, you know, our balance sheet is one of our strengths. In this time last year, in Q1 of last year, we kind of, we called our balance sheet the port in the storm for our clients. You see that flight to quality. We're very proud of our balance sheet. It's vanilla, it's liquid, it stands stress tests, and it allows us to be there for our clients.\nIt's short in duration. We repositioned it going into the higher for longer rate environment, as you would remember, in Q4 of 2022, we repositioned it. We've taken a lot of proactive steps to make our balance sheet durable and liquid and to withstand a wide range of scenarios.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nGerard, I'm just going to add that it's easy to think that just because at this very moment in time we're looking out, there seems to be some greater consensus than we've had for a little while around what might happen with the Fed in the fall, across September and the balance of the year. It's easy to think somehow that the range of risks is somehow narrowed as a result of that. There's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. We've got all bunch of other types of geopolitical risks out in the world. We're continuing to grind through elections that we've talked about through the course of the year.\nThere are all other things happening. We've still got wars going on. Our approach to all of these questions, and Dermot really made the point, is to be prepared for all the different types of outcomes that are possible. You can see us, we run conservative on liquidity, we run conservative on capital. You can see it in our ratios that we talked about that Dermot outlined in his prepared remarks. That's a very important anchor point for us so that we can be agile according to however things play out. Because the one thing we can be absolutely sure of is they won't play out exactly the way anybody expects.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nVery good. Then, just as a follow-up, Robin, you talked about the new business wins in the quarter, and you talked about 1BNY as well. It appears that you're having success in chipping down or breaking down some of the silos that many organizations always struggle with. Can you share with us some of the tools you're using to break those silos and how I would assume you're not 100% complete breaking them all down, but how far along are you in actually breaking them down?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nWell, the company's been around for 240 years, and we've acquired a lot of different businesses and companies over time. These things do build up over a period of time. The short answer to your question is we passionately believe as a whole leadership team, that the answer to the question is culture. I've said before, in a slightly pithy way and quoting other people or sort of paraphrasing them, if you will, that culture eats strategy for breakfast, as it was once famously said by Peter Drucker. We add to that execution eats strategy for lunch.\nThat's just a long way of saying that the power, our culture pillar, which is one of our three pillars, is the thing that's enabling us to run our company better. That in turn is allowing us to be more for our clients. The trick to this for us has been investing in our people. It's been creating the benefits, the experiences, the employee experience, the pride, association with the company, the feedback loop that shows that when we do these things, we get better outcomes for our clients. That translates into better outcomes in the bottom line. There's a flywheel effect here that actually builds on itself.\nThe spring in the step of our employees is now powering that forward. That's what gives us confidence that we've really turned the corner on it. People want to throw in with the whole because they see that is not only better for the company, it's actually better for their business because joining their products with other products around the company is allowing us to be more for clients. It actually feels good to see the benefits in the ultimate results. That's for us, the North Star of how we're doing it. While we've certainly got a distance to go, the early results have been pretty encouraging.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, great, thanks. Morning, guys. Maybe if I could just come back to sticking with the NII guide of down 10%. I'm having trouble getting there. Just to confirm it sounds, Dermot, like what you're saying is it's really almost totally a deposit driven guide on a seasonal basis. I just wanted to sort of confirm that given how you've outlined the balance sheet, sensitivity to different rate scenarios is pretty strong. Of course you have the benefit of securities portfolio reinvestment. Is it really simply just the seasonal deposit dynamic?\nThen if you can just talk about how NIIs factor into that seasonal deposit dynamic and then of course, as we move into next year in Q1 seasonally, of course, we should be back positive again. I just want to confirm that.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nI guess Brian, in the way you've asked the question, in some ways you've answered the question to yourself. I would confirm how you're thinking about it in terms of the seasonal decline, and it is a deposit story. I would just reference last year as the guide in terms of. In January of last year, we guided 20% for the year and then we started out the gates well and you as a collective put pressure on me to change the guidance, which I didn't do. We ended the year at 24%. Last year, we used the word skewed to the upside, but humble about the fact of what lies in front of us.\nI would say the percentages are different this year, the environment is different, but the sentiment is the same. I'm humble about what the outcome outcome could be and uncertainty. It's there because, as Robin said, for sure what we think is going to happen is not going to happen. I would say, we're cautiously optimistic. Your point, it is a deposit story, and within the deposit story, it really is the mix between NIBs and IBs.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nRight. Okay. Yes, fair enough there. Then maybe just back to the operating leverage dynamic. This can be for both Dermot and Robin. Obviously, you're starting off really well with like 100 basis points plus of positive operating leverage as we move into the second half, notwithstanding market movements that would obviously influence the fee revenue dynamic. Given the traction that you're showing sequentially in your core business growth, core business sales, and I guess the fact that you've made these investments already. I just wanted to get a sense of whether you feel like you're able to scale those investments in the second half.\nObviously with your flat operating expense guidance, it would seem that's the case. If the revenue does turn out to be better than expected from an organic growth perspective, would we see the expense base creep up a little bit? Notwithstanding, of course, you'd still generate positive leverage.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nOkay, lot of questions in that second question. I would say, like when I talk to the teams, right. You're hitting on a very important point. In that, I really focus on running the company better. Then we focus on the operating leverage, not expense as a means to an end. If revenue-related expenses creep up, that we starve businesses of investment to solve for a flat number, because that's what we said we were going to do. I think that's quite important. It's important to get the balance right, that investment and running the company better; it kind of is the same thing.\nThat's a cultural transformation that's underway with all of our people. We really are focused on getting value for money. We spend a lot of money. We spend over $12.5 billion every year. We want to get the best value we can for that. We do that in a number of different ways. Some of the investments that we've made over the last couple of years, we're beginning to see the scale impact in that. You can see that in our most profitable segment, Markets and Wealth Services; it's a mid-40s margin. We continue to invest at the margin, which is what you want us to see, which is what you want to see from us.\nWe continue to digitize, we continue to automate, we continue to reduce manual process, which ultimately will feed into headcount and better quality jobs for our folks and better careers. I think over time, if organic growth plays out, it will feed into a better outcome in operating leverage, not us just growing expenses because revenues are better.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nI just want to draw out one additional thing that Dermot said as well, Brian, which is we have a lot of work to do. There's no question about it. He used the term skew and slightly optimistic, but staying humble when it related to NII. This one is just about a lot of hard work and really focusing on this point about running the company better. As a double click into the way that we're thinking about it, if you look at the second quarter and we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been a seasonally strong quarter.\nIf you double click into it and the market and wealth services point that Dermot just mentioned, that's an investment story because as we've said, we're in a good spot on the pre-tax margin of that segment. So we just want more. That's growth. We don't want to dilute the margin, but we're not trying to save expense dollars.\nIn Securities Services and in Investments and Wealth, where we said there is in fact a margin journey that we have ahead of us, that's where you can actually see negative expenses in both of those segments for the quarter, which is a sign of the fact that we're both investing, but we're doing even more discipline in those businesses. That's how the whole thing comes together for the company.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. That's great color. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is coming from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\n\nRajiv Bhatia\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nYeah, there was some progress on the investment and wealth management margin in the quarter. I guess my quick question is, are your margins different on the asset management side side of the business versus the wealth management side? Do you have a timeline for getting back to that 25% plus margin?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY\n\nI don't think we get into the detail of the split between the two. The segment overall, I guess we've said over the last several quarters we believe we can go back to the 25% margin over a period of a few years. Just to follow on from Robin's answer to the last question, we've shown, I think, good expense discipline over the last 12 months in terms of okay, revenues have been a little bit challenged in the segment due to a variety of reasons, and we've taken tough decisions. That's allowed us to grow the margin by 200 basis points over the last year, which really is kind of the financial discipline about it.\nWe do believe where we are now with distribution as a platform, very, very strong performance in fixed income, LDI, and Insight, that the momentum is there within the segment to grow. As Robin said, the addition of Jose to the leadership team, joining in September, gives us confidence about what we can do in the future.\n\nRajiv Bhatia\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nGot it.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThanks.\nThanks, Rajiv.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Robin for additional or closing remarks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks everyone for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest in BNY. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well and enjoy the balance of the summer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference call and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations and Corporate Development, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here with Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonagh, our Chief Financial Officer. As always, we will reference our Financial Highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com, and I'll note that our remarks will contains forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.\nActual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the Earnings Press Release, Financial Supplement, and Financial Highlights presentation. All available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 16 April 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Dermot will talk you through the financials in a moment. In summary, BNY Mellon is off to an encouraging start for the year. The firm delivered solid financial performance while we continued to take important steps in the deliberate transformation of our company, and we're seeing early signs of progress that give us confidence as we work toward the opportunity ahead.\nLooking beyond BNY Mellon, the first three months of the year provided a mostly constructive operating environment with global markets signaling expectations for continued growth. Equity and credit markets rallied even as rate-cut expectations partially unwound and bond yields rose. Foreign exchange markets, on the other hand, saw a continuation of the relatively low volumes and muted volatility that we've now seen for the past several quarters.\nOf course there are many tail risks, including a variety of different market scenarios, the possibility of escalation in one of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, or an unexpected result in the many elections taking place worldwide this year. As I've said many times before, being resilient matters and this represents a commercial strength for our business. We are constantly preparing and positioning for a wide range of potential scenarios to support our clients and deliver compelling outcomes for our shareholders.\nNow referring to page two of the Financial Highlights presentation, BNY Mellon delivered double-digit EPS growth as well as pre-tax margin and ROTCE expansion on the back of positive operating leverage. In Q1 we reported earnings per share of $1.25, up 11% year-over-year and excluding notable items. Earnings per share of $1.29 were up 14%.\nTotal revenue of $4.5 billion was up 3% year-over-year. That included 8% growth in Investment Services fees led by strength in asset servicing, issuer services, and clearance and collateral management, which more than offset revenue headwinds from muted volatility in FX markets and lower net interest income. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 2% year-over-year and up 1% excluding notable items, consistent with our goal to generate at least some operating leverage this year.\nIn Q1 we did deliver positive operating leverage both on a reported basis and excluding notable items. Our reported pre-tax margin was 29% or 30% excluding notable items and we generated a 21% return on tangible common equity. Our balance sheet remained strong with capital and liquidity ratios in line with our management targets and deposit balances were up both year-over-year and sequentially year to date.\nWe returned close to 140% earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. On our last earnings call in January, we communicated medium term financial targets and presented our plan to improve BNY Mellon's financial performance. We frame this work for our people through three strategic be more for our clients, run our company better, and power our culture.\nThroughout the Q1 we've made progress to be more for our clients, including both product innovation and greater intensity around better delivering our platforms to the market so we can truly help clients achieve their ambitions as a global financial services company. Our unique portfolio of market leading and complementary businesses presents a tremendous additional value for our clients and shareholders. As you know, we are maturing our one BNY Mellon initiative by implementing this mentality into the nuts and bolts processes across the company.\nFor example, we recently announced that Ashton Thomas Securities, an independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, will use clearing and custody services from Pershing and BNY Mellon, Precision Direct indexing capabilities from Investment Management. This is a great example of multiple lines of business working together to provide holistic solutions for clients. As we continue to grow our client roster, we also know that delivering more to our existing clients represents a significant opportunity.\nAs another example, last month we expanded on a longstanding relationship with CIFC, an alternative credit specialist and existing client of ours in asset servicing and corporate trust, to bring their US direct lending strategy onto our global distribution platform.This also speaks to the incremental value that asset servicing can bring to our asset manager clients by allowing them to tap into BNY Mellon's global distribution platform to extend the reach of their capabilities.\nConsistent with our previously communicated intention to grow the revenue contribution of our market and wealth services segment, we're starting to see our investments to accelerate revenue growth in this high margin segment begin to bear fruit. For example, we continue to be encouraged by the level of interest from both new and existing clients in our Wove wealth advisory platform. We have several clients live on the platform today. We closed a number of deals in the Q1, and the sales pipeline continues to be strong across market and wealth services. We also continue to bring new solutions to the market.\nFor example, Treasury Services successfully launched Virtual Account Based Solutions, a set of cash management solutions to meet our clients' demands for more flexibility and transparency into their payment flows. Next, we are taking important steps to run our company better by simplifying processes, powering our platforms, and embracing new technologies. Over the past several months, we've been working to realign several similar products and services across our lines of business. The largest of these changes was moving institutional solutions from Pershing to our clearing and collateral management business.\nThis is also part of making progress toward adopting a platform's operating model. By uniting related capabilities, we can do things in one place, do them well, and elevate overall execution to better serve our clients and drive growth. Last month, we went live with the first step on the transition into our new model. While it has taken and will continue to take a lot of hard work as we transform our operating model over time, we are confident this new way of working will create better outcomes for our clients, and it will also create more efficiency and enhanced risk management.\nAround 15% of our people around the world are now working in our new operating model, allowing them to feel more connected to what we're doing and empowered to make change. I'd like to thank our teams who are part of this exciting change for pushing us forward as we mark this important milestone. We also see meaningful opportunity over the coming years from continued digitization and re-engineering initiatives as well as from embracing new technologies. To support this effort, we are making deliberate investments enabling us to scale AI technologies across the organization through our enterprise AI hub.\nLast month NVIDIA announced that BNY Mellon became the first major bank to deploy a DGX SuperPOD which will accelerate our processing capacity to innovate, reduce risk, and launch AI enabled capabilities. Our people have identified hundreds of use cases across BNY Mellon and we already have several in production today. Across the company, it's our people who continue to power our culture. If you were to walk the halls of BNY Mellon, you'd feel the energy and sense of purpose our leadership team feels when we visit our teams around the world. To that end, we're investing in our people.\nOver the past several months we launched new learning and feedback platforms powered by AI, expanded employee benefits, launched a new well-being support program, improved and accelerated our year-end feedback and compensation processes, and more.We're delighted to welcome Shannon Hobbs who will join us as our new Chief People Officer in June. As we continue to power our culture forward, we adopted the following five core principles to guide how our teams work and collaborate as we drive our success as a company. Be client obsessed, Spark progress, own it, stay curious, and thrive together.\nTo wrap up, our performance in the Q1 provides a glimpse of BNY Mellon's potential. Running our company better, inclusive of our focus on platforms, is enabling us to improve profitability and invest in our future. While we are pleased to see early signs of progress, we remain focused on the significant work ahead of us as we become more for our clients and deliver higher performance for our shareholders. As I have said before, the transformation of our company is a multi-year endeavor, but we've started 2024, the year of our 240th anniversary, with a sense of excitement and determination around what's possible. Now. Over to you, Dermot.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Referring to page three of the presentation, I'll start with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.5 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This reflects 8% growth in Investment Services fees on the back of higher market values, increased client activity, and net new business, partially offset by a 14% decline in foreign exchange revenue as a result of lower market volatility.\nBNY's assets under custody and/or administration of $48.8 trillion were up 5% year-over-year, and assets under management of $2 trillion were up 6% year-over-year, both largely reflecting higher market values. Investment and other revenue was $182 million in the quarter. Effective 1 January, we adopted new accounting guidance for our investments in renewable energy projects, resulting in an approximately $50 million increase to investment and other revenue.\nWe have restated prior periods in our earnings materials to provide you with like for like year-over-year and sequential comparisons. The adoption of this new accounting guidance is largely neutral to net income and earnings per share, as the increase in provision for income taxes roughly equals the increase in investment and other revenue. Net Interest Income decreased by 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting changes in the composition of deposits partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates.\nExpenses were up 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items, primarily severance. Expense growth was from incremental investments and employee merit increases offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $27 million in the quarter, primarily driven by reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure. As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.25, up 11% year-over-year, a pre-tax margin of 29%, and a return on tangible common equity of 20.7%.\nExcluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.29, up 14% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 30% and our return on tangible common equity was 21.3%.Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.9%. Average assets increased by 1% sequentially as deposit balances grew and Tier 1 capital decreased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital return to common shareholders partially offset by capital generated through earnings. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 10.8%.\nThe quarter-over-quarter decline reflects a temporary increase in risk-weighted assets at the end of the quarter, which was driven by discrete overdrafts in our custody and securities clearing businesses, as well as strong demand for our agency securities lending program consistent with Tier 1 capital. CET1 capital decreased by 1% sequentially.\nOver the course of the quarter. We returned $1.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 138%. Turning to liquidity, our regulatory ratios remained strong. The consolidated Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 117% flat sequentially, and our consolidated Net Stable Funding Ratio was 136%, up 1 percentage point sequentially.Moving on to Net Interest Income and the underlying balance sheet trends on page five.\nNet interest income of over $1 billion was down 8% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by changes in the composition of deposits, partially offset by the benefit of reinvesting maturing fixed rate securities in higher yielding alternatives.\nAgainst typical seasonal patterns. Average deposit balances increased by 2% sequentially. Solid 4% growth in interest-bearing deposits was partially offset by a 5% decline in non-interest-bearing deposits, which was in line with our expectations. Average interest earning assets were up 1% quarter-over-quarter. We reduced our cash and reverse repo balances by 2% and increased our investment securities portfolio by 5%. Average loan balances remained flat.\nTurning to our business segments starting on page six, please remember that in Q1 we made certain realignments of similar products and services across our lines of business, consistent with our work to operate and as a more unified company. As Robin mentioned earlier, the largest change was the movement of Institutional Solutions from Pershing to clearing and collateral management both in the Markets and Wealth Services segment.\nWe made other smaller changes across our business segments. We have restated prior periods for consistency. Please refer to the revised financial supplement that we filed on 26 March for detailed reconciliations to previous disclosures. Now starting with Securities Services on page six. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Investment Services fees were up 8% year-over-year in asset servicing. Investment Services fees were up 8% driven by higher market values, net new business, and higher client activity.\nWe've remained focused on deal margins and as a result, the year-over-year impact of repricing on fee growth was de minimis. Consistent with past quarters, we continue to see particular success with our ETF offering. ETF assets under custody and/or administration surpassed $2 trillion this quarter, up over 40% year-over-year on the back of higher market values, net new business, and client flows, and the number of funds serviced was up 16% year-over-year. While the pace of alternative fund launches was slower than in the prior year quarter.\nInvestment services fees for alternatives were up over 10% on a year-over-year basis. Throughout the quarter we saw broad-based strength across client segments, products, and regions. In Issuer Services, Investment Services fees were up 11%, reflecting net new business across both depository receipts and corporate trust as well as higher cancellation fees in depository receipts.\nForeign exchange revenue was down 11% year-over-year, and Net Interest Income was down 12%. Expenses of $1.5 billion were flat year-over-year, reflecting incremental investments, as well as the impact of employee merit increases, offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $591 million, a 4% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin expanded to 28%. Next, Markets and Wealth Services on page seven.\nMarkets and Wealth Services report a total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Total Investment Services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, Investment Services fees were up 3%, reflecting higher market values and client activity, partially offset by the impact of business lost in the prior year.\nNet new assets were negative $2 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of the aforementioned lost business. Client demand for our Wealth Advisor platform Wove continues to be strong. In the Q1, we signed nine additional client agreements, including our first direct indexing clients, and we onboarded four clients onto the platform.\nIn Treasury Services, Investment Services fees increased by 5% driven by net new business. We continue to invest in our sales and service teams, new products, and technology and so we are pleased with this solid growth and momentum continues to build.\nLast but not least, strength in clearance and collateral management continued with Investment Services fees up 13% on the back of broad-based growth both in the US and internationally. Net interest income for the segment overall was down 7% year-over-year. Expenses of $834 million were up 7% year-over-year, reflecting incremental investments, revenue-related expenses, and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings.\nPre-tax income was down 2% year-over-year at $678 million, representing a 45% pre-tax margin. Moving on to Investment and Wealth Management on page eight. Investment and wealth management reported total revenue of $846 million, up 2% year-over-year. In investment management, revenue was up 2% driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows, and lower performance fees. In our wealth management business, revenue also increased by 2% driven by higher market values partially offset by changes in product mix and lower net interest.\nNoninterest expenses of $740 million were flat year-over-year primarily reflecting the impact of incremental investments and employee merit increases which was offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $107 million, up 15% year-over-year, representing a pre-tax margin of 13%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 6% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw $16 billion of net inflows into our long term active strategies with strength in LDI and fixed income, and we saw $15 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Strength in our short term cash strategies continued with $16 billion of net inflows on the back of differentiated investment performance in our Dreyfus Money Market Fund Complex.\nWealth Management client assets of $309 billion increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows. Page nine shows the results of the other segment. I will close by reiterating our existing outlook for the full year 2024. As I've said before, we have positioned our balance sheet for a range of interest rate scenarios and we're managing both sides of it proactively and so despite the repricing of the curve since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect net interest income for the full year to be down 10% year-over-year assuming current market implied interest rates for the remainder of 2024.\nSimilarly, on expenses, our goal continues to be for full year 2024 expenses excluding notable items to be flat year-over-year. We are off to a good start, but we have more work ahead of us to realize further efficiency savings and drive year-over-year expense growth rates lower over the coming quarters while we continue to make room for additional investments across our businesses. Overall, we remain determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this year.\nWhile we don't manage the firm to operating leverage on a quarterly basis, our performance in Q1 with positive operating leverage on both a reported and an operating basis gives us confidence that we're on track. In light of the adoption of the new accounting guidance for our investments in renewable energy projects, which, as I discussed earlier, increases both our investment and other revenue, and the provision for income taxes, I'll note that we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be between 23% and 24%.\nWe continue to expect returning 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks over the course of the year. As always, we will manage share repurchases cognizant of the macroeconomic environment, balance sheet size, and many other factors. For the foreseeable future, we will calibrate the pace of buybacks to maintain our Tier 1 leverage ratio close to the top end of our 5.5% to 6% medium-term target range.\nTo wrap up, over the past three months, we've made good progress towards achieving our targets for 2024, and we're encouraged by the drive we're seeing in all corners of the firm as our people embrace being more for our clients, running our company better, and powering our culture. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Robin, really nice progress, I guess, on organic growth initiatives across a handful of businesses underneath BNY Mellon, as some of the things you talked about are starting to kind of take hold. Can you maybe frame what the firm's organic growth rate aspirations are for the next couple of years? How are you thinking about that for 2024 as well? Then, as a side question, I guess to that, we've seen quite a significant amount of activity in sort of clearance and collateral management. Can you maybe help size what is sort of transitory versus more of a recurring baseline to think about from here? Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSure, Alex. Morning. Let me start with the growth question. As you point out, we are feeling quite good about the early momentum that we have in growth. As you know, we set it out last year to really get our house in order, generate positive operating leverage, and really think about the various different investments to drive shorter, medium, and longer term growth. That's really what we've been focused on, and we're pleased that we've got a good start to the year on it.\nClearly, we're trying to control the things that we can control. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and as Dermot touched on as well, our focus here has really been wrapped around being more for our clients, our commercial model. We hired our first Chief Commercial Officer. We're operationalizing one BNY Mellon, as I called it, the nuts and bolts, kind of getting into building that into our client coverage organization, our coverage practice, starting to deliver integrated solutions.\nI gave a couple of examples of those in my prepared remarks, and we've got a whole bunch more things that really cut across all of the different segments that are related to that. Look, it's early in the journey. I would have said maybe last year we were working the problem. I think now I would say we're working the opportunity. Could you just remind me the second part of your question?\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, sure. Really nice results out of clearance of collateral management for the firm. It's been a pretty active market in Q1 related to treasury issuance and activity there broadly. I'm just trying to get a sense for a better baseline to think about from here. Was there anything kind of transitory in the Q1 that helped the numbers, or is this a good baseline to think about going forward?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nLook, I would say in terms of transitory, not really, but let me just go through a few of the drivers. Remember that it's a business that, like several of the businesses we have, respond to volumes. It was an active quarter when it comes to trading volumes in the US treasury market. Now, for better or for worse, US treasuries is kind of a growth business, so that's probably a bit more of a secular tailwind as opposed to something cyclical.\nRemember, under the hood in clearance and collateral management, we've also been investing in the operating model of that business, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, and took something that was very, very adjacent to our clearing business from Pershing Institutional Clearing and aligned it with the rest of our bigger clearing business in clearance and collateral management.\nWhat we're finding now in those conversations with customers, it's a much cleaner conversation because we've got the ability to deliver all the solutions in our clearing business, whether it's US Treasuries, whether it's international, whether it's the different models of clearing that we offer, we're able to deliver that in one conversation with a client, and clients are responding to that. I would call that secular as well.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thanks so much. I'll hop back in the queue.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Alex.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermot.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nGood morning, Steven.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nWanted to start with a question on capital, a bit of a two-parter, if you will. I was hoping you could just speak to the drivers of RWA growth. Growth in Q1, which was fairly robust, where you're seeing attractive opportunities to deploy that excess capital. Just how we should be thinking about the cadence of the buyback. You alluded to this somewhat, Dermot, but I was hoping we could drill down into. You noted the 6% target or that upper bound on tier one leverage is how should we be thinking about the cadence of buyback in light of planned balance sheet actions and growth potential?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nOkay, I'll take that one. Steven, good morning. Some of the capital increase, there are two parts to the RWA increase. One was a kind of temporary increase around quarter end as it relates to discrete overdrafts in custody and securities clearing businesses. That's kind of come and gone. There was also strong demand for our agency securities lending program throughout the quarter, particularly leading up to quarter end, and that's continued into this quarter.\nI would say half of it was that and half of it was temporary as it relates to the buyback. There's a little bit of a Groundhog Day here in terms of how we thought about Q1 of last year versus how we're thinking about Q1 of this year. Both quarters we got off to a strong start. Look, there's a lot of rate volatility out there in the market. You know, you've seen the backup in rates last week with the hot inflation report.\nLast year it was the war in Ukraine. This year it's the geopolitics in the Middle East. We kind of gave a guidance in January where we said we were going to be 100% more of earnings throughout the year. We don't give quarter by quarter guidance.I'd reiterate the guidance of 100% or more, notwithstanding the fact Q1 was very good at 138%. I wouldn't expect that pace to continue, but we'll take it quarter by quarter.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. For my follow up, maybe just drilling down into the investment and wealth margins in particular, since across the other segments we're seeing continued progress towards the longer term targets. That's admittedly the segment with the biggest shortfall. I know in the prepared remarks, Dermot, you noted that you're making investments in the business and just wanted to better understand, one, where are those dollars getting deployed? Maybe if you could just speak to the primary drivers underpinning that glide path to 25%. How much is contingent on revenue growth versus expense optimization?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nOkay, the first point would be pre-tax margin for Q1. There was around 13%. If you normalize that for typical, you know, seasonal volatility in terms of retirement-eligible stock and such like, if you backed that out and adjusted, the margin would have been somewhere in the 16% ZIP code. We feel pretty good about that. Still a ton of work to do. I would say, you know, it's not one thing over the other. It depends on which part of the business you're talking about.\nIn some of our asset managers, we're investing, we're launching new products. Clients in some places continue to de-risk and move from more risk-on equity to passive fixed income. In other cases, we see clients coming in and AUM growing. We were very pleased with the performance of our Dreyfus cash management business in Q1, where we saw strong inflows, and the performance of the business in terms of returns was first quartile. We feel very good about that. We are investing in the business to give our clients good products to invest in.\nThe flip side is we still believe as it relates to running the company better and desiloing the firm and connecting asset management to the broader enterprise, there's a lot of opportunity there, and at the same time as the opportunity, it allows us to take costs out and become a lot more efficient. I would say we're working both sides of it. We see more opportunity on the revenue side, and we're working the problem on the efficiency side.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nVery helpful. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, I had two questions. One was just on the AI commentary that you were leading with in the prepared remarks, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about the benefits to the expense ratio and the timeframe with which this is going to flow through because there's clearly revenue enhancing opportunities and expense reducing or flattening, and how much of this AI investment is, how important is it to your 2024 expense outlook. If you could give us the medium term outlook, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSure. Hi Betsy, first of all, great to have you on the call. Really glad to have you back, and to know that you're doing well. Thanks so much. On the AI, I'll start with the latter part of your question, which is I really don't think this is a 2024 story. Of course we're doing things in 2024. If you ask me to try to put a pin in where the real benefits and sort of tailwinds kick in, I'm actually going to say it's not even necessarily a 2025 story, although maybe we'll see a little bit in 2025. I think this is a 2026 and on out benefit on the expense line.\nLet me go back to the sort of the premise of your question and just sort of briefly mention how we're embracing it. I'll put it actually through the three pillars that we've laid out in terms that are guiding so much of what we're doing in the company. First, being more for our clients, we think there are solutions out there for clients that are going to help them make better decisions, see risks, be able to be more efficient themselves. We've got software in market today doing that with predictive trade analytics around fails and settlements, allowing clients to be able to look out and to see and take evasive action essentially on potential fails.\nBy the way, some of those actions involve using other parts of the BNY Mellon platforms in order to be able to improve their businesses. That's an interesting example. There are going to be a lot more of those under the heading of running our company better. This is going to be about streamlining business processes, productivity.\nFiguring out and seeing anomalies that we can see. Code Assistant, as so many people talk about, for our developers. I was walking around one of our buildings the other day talking to one of our developers. They'd been out of school for a year and change, and already they think they're 25% more productive as a developer. That's in the very early days of using GitHub Copilot. That's going to be, there's going to be more there, and that ultimately is going to create efficiencies for us. Under the culture heading, which is very important, we want AI to empower our people to be able to go out and be able to be more efficient in terms of what they're doing.\nThere are any number of different examples of things over time that we think AI is going to be able to help with us. Now, importantly, in this is the way in which we're doing it. Both Dermot and I talked about platforms, and another concept in our platform strategy is to create these hubs, these centers of excellence. In AI, that's particularly important. We do not want to repeat the problems that we've had in the past of having everyone go off in their own direction.\nActually, in AI, it's particularly important because problem statements that sound different can in fact have very common root causes. You might want to be able to respond to an RFP, you might want to generate summaries of documents, you might want to be able to get a head start on a research report. Actually, when you look under the heading, those three things sound different, but the AI that's actually powering them, some of the sort of mini platforms that are required are very, very similar.\nWe're using our AI hub to collect these different use cases and then be able to sort of deliver solutions and mini AI platforms that can then be used in multiple places around the company. We're excited about this. We think it's going to be very significant over time, but it's not a 24 story.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, got it. That's super helpful with the color, appreciate that. Just a follow up on the tax rate guidance. You know, this is part of the accounting change, I believe. Is that right? Can you tell us where in the P-pop the offsets are? Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSorry, I missed the last part of it, Betsy. Where are they from?\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, there's offsets. Right, to the tax. The tax is impacted by the accounting change, is that right?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah. Economically, it's net neutral for the firm. It's just a gross up in revenue, which will show up in the interest and other revenue line. The offset to that i In the tax line. We filed an 8-K a couple of weeks ago where we restated all the prior periods for comparison, so that people will see it on a consistent basis going forward.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nSure. I just wanted to highlight that your tax rate guide has the offsets in the revenue, so I appreciate that. Thank you.\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good morning. Not sure if this was addressed here, but give us in terms of your outlook on deposits. I think the period end saw a pretty big uptick to $309 billion. Just give us a sense of, within your NII guidance, one, what are you assuming in terms of deposit balances? Secondly, if the forward curve holds, is the next inflection on NII and margin higher or lower? Yeah. Thank you.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nAs at the quarter end, Ebrahim, I think the spot number was around $310 billion of deposits. That was largely, you may recall that quarter end this year fell on Good Friday, where markets were closed. We got a lot of clients putting cash in so that they could make certain payments. We saw a kind of a surge in deposits over the last few days of the quarter. They've largely left the system now, and we've returned to more normal levels, which is in the kind of high $270 billion range. That's really the explanation for the spot deposit balance versus the average trend. Sequentially, we're down 6% in the deposits or NII, and 8% year-over-year. We saw a 2% growth in the deposit balance.\nGenerally speaking, our guide at the beginning of the year was down 10%. Given the rate volatility and what's going on with the inflation report last week and the backup in rates, et cetera, et cetera, we don't see, you know, there's nothing that's causing us to think that we should change our guidance between now and the balance of the year. We're very neutrally positioned as to whether rates go up a little bit from here or down a little bit from here, and we feel very good about the overall guidance that we gave in January, which was approximately, you know, down 10%.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. One just follow up in terms of some of the actions you took in moving businesses in Pershing. As we think about the strategic review, I guess, Robin, maybe it began a year ago, longer than that. Give us a sense of, in terms of the franchise positioning, how the businesses are talking to each other, and they're in the right place within the enterprise. Is all of that done? How close are you to getting the franchise synced up in terms of where it's humming along with regards to what you want to achieve in terms of client synergies? Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThe punchline is we're making good progress, but you're essentially asking a cultural question, and we're not done on that. When we did, to go back to your point, our original strategy reviews, which is 18 months or so ago now, and took us a few months to go through, we were really focused on answering the questions of what are we doing, are we doing the right things, how are we doing them, are we doing them in the right way, do we have the right people doing them. We looked at that, and we certainly found bits of the company that were just in the wrong place. We've lifted those bits up, and we've put them in what we now think are the right place. That's what both Dermot and I talked about in our prepared remarks.\nThat was what some of the restatement of prior periods was so that you could make the easier comparisons. There was about that, that was basic blocking and tackling. The bigger opportunity for sure is how the businesses work together, not only to be more for clients, by saying, hey, that client over there is a client, but they're not my client in my business. Can we work together to basically make them a client of both businesses?\nThat's very significant. That's where we talk about maturing BNY Mellon into the real heart of a new commercial coverage model. That's being driven by our Chief Commercial Officer. Another part of this is saying, huh, there are things that we used to think of as standalone capabilities, some might call them products. We think about them as client platforms. In fact, what the client is asking for, and we really heard this when we did our Voice of Client survey, they don't want these individual products. They want us to take them and weave them together to create solutions for them that are on point to their needs. We've also started to do that, and I mentioned some examples of that.\nThat's a very powerful thing because that takes the breadth of our company, and rather than it being siloed, which is getting in the way of solutions, it's now actually ending up being the opportunity for us to deliver from the breadth of our platforms to our clients with solutions that, frankly, some other people aren't going to be able to do. We think that's very exciting. In those journeys, we're still relatively early, and that is cultural, and we've been doing a lot of things internally in the firm to make sure that our people are lined up behind that. It's early days, but we're quite excited about the direction of travel.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Sell-Side Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nMorning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start. Dermot, when you were walking through Pershing, I believe you talked about the offboarding and the impact and how that was weighing on the net new assets. Could you give us an update on how far we are along in that offboarding process and how much we should continue to expect for the rest of the year? Also, LPL recently announced the acquisition of Atria, which I understand was a Pershing client, and they're planning to consolidate those operations in 2025. Is that going to extend maybe some of the headwinds that we're seeing from some of these idiosyncratic offboardings?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nOkay, thanks for the question. The first thing I would say about Pershing, in the context of the overall kind of the segment. With respect to Pershing, we continue to invest in Pershing. Pershing continues to grow, and as we've said since the deconversion was announced, we're going to earn our way out of this situation, and that's what's happening. We still as a business feel very, very good about Pershing and our ability. It's a market that's growing in mid single digits on an annual basis, and we're a big player in that market, so we're going to win our shares.\nWhile the deconversion was unfortunate, we continue to march on, and we learn our way out. Specifically, I would say we would be largely done with the deconversion by Q3 of this year. As it relates to the second part, I would say, look, we're in a competitive market, people are going to do things. You know, the LPL-Atria thing, it's not a particular headwind, it's not been highlighted. To me, it's not hit my radar in terms of, oh my gosh, we need to worry about that. I think we're winning more than we're losing, and we're investing, and that's really going well.\nWhen you take it in the context of what's going on with Wove, we're building a strong pipeline there. The backlog is looking good. We've added nine clients to the platform in Q1 of this year, and we made a commitment to the market that we would kind of add $30 to 40 million of revenue this year. We still feel very good about that guidance and that commitment that we made to you back in January.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nBrennan, I just add on the business front to that, which is, remember that when we look at a deconversion, for sure, those happen. The one that you're referring to, the original one, was a larger one. We are also growing with our clients, our clients are growing with us, and we also are on the receiving end of rollups as well. Our clients are quite acquisitive, and we have a couple of clients who've been doing acquisitions, and we have some of our largest clients who are growing very significantly and very healthily.\nIt's always unfortunate when there's a rollup that goes against us, but when there are rollups that go with our clients, those things balance out to some extent, which is why Dermot makes the point about overall, we still feel quite enthusiastic about the net new assets growth over time.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Sell-Side Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks for that color. When we think about the deposits, I'm trying to think about, really, Dermot, the fact that here we are one quarter in. I get it, you maybe don't want to update expectations, but it seems like based on what we've seen so far, deposit trends seem to be doing better than expected. We saw a pickup in the deposit balances at year end. They sustained, which is a little unusual. Even though they've come down from EOP at $331 billion, they're still in a similar ballpark to where you were on the average. Are you guys, is there something specific that's driving the expectation for deposit decline, or is it just a component of conservatism?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nIf I'm honest with you, I would say it's a little bit of both. I would expect, like everybody expected. Deposits to decline this year, it hasn't necessarily happened yet. I kind of think I make that statement in the context of QT. If you look at the ORP in Q1, the drain largely came from there. If QT continues and rates stay higher for longer, on balance, I would expect deposits to decline from here. I don't see anything that tells me that I should update the guidance from down 10% NII year-over-year.\nUnderneath the hood, in terms of the composition of the deposits themselves, you have the mix between interest bearing and non interest bearing. As rates stay higher for longer, I would expect nibs to grind a little bit lower. The overall balance may be higher, but you have the mix underneath which will kind of feed into that overall NII guidance. It's not just the absolute level, it's also the composition of it.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nSenior Sell-Side Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, no, that's great. Thanks for the candor and embracing the uncertainty.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nHi, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nNon interest bearing deposits inched down again, and I'm just wondering where that floor is. It's 18% versus 19% last quarter and 26% year-over-year. On the other hand, your servicing fees were up 8% year-over-year. I'm not sure if I should draw a link or not. Maybe what you're not getting in non interest bearing deposits, you're getting in servicing fees. The question is how are you getting such strong servicing fee growth year-over-year of 8%. How much of that is due to markets? How much of that is sustainable? Is any of that simply a substitution effect from the non-interest-bearing deposits to servicing fees?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon",
    "content2": "Thanks for the question, Mike. Let's go with the fee component first. Q1 is kind of one of those quarters where we came into the year, I guess, both in deposits and in pipeline and sales activity in very good shape. As it relates to kind of asset servicing in particular, the pipeline was strong, we felt good coming into the year, markets rallied nicely, and clients were in risk-on mode, doing more with us. Flows were stronger, balances are higher, and we're winning our share of mandates.\nLittle factoids for like, of all the deals that we competed for in Q1, we won north of 50%. We're competitive, we're pricing well, we're very focused on client profitability and deal margin. It goes back to the point that we made in several quarters prior to this where we're very focused on the cost to serve. By improving margin, focusing on cost to serve, being more for clients, we can be more competitive in the pricing point.\nI made the point in my prepared remarks that we saw repricing being de minimis. It was a good quarter all around, and we feel very good about the backlog and the pipeline going forward as it relates to the mix between fees and deposits. You know, we don't lead with deposits as an institution. Clients do multiple things with us across the enterprise, and as a consequence of that, they leave deposits with us. You know, it's an important point, but 2/3 of our deposits are operational in nature and therefore very sticky.\nWith a higher for longer rate environment, it's only natural to expect that people with nibs are going to, over time, move out of that and look for a higher yield. It's inevitable, and it's a fact of life, and we're ready to deal with that. I'm very proud of what our global Liquidity solutions team is doing in terms of winning their share of the business in terms of the deposits and how we price them. Sequentially, we've seen the balances go up because of that competitive pricing. All in all, when you take the ecosystem together, we feel very good about where we're at.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nMike, there was nothing idiosyncratic about trade offs to the other part of your question. I don't see the quarter built around that at all.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. For a separate question, for all the growth in servicing fees, asset management, what can you do to reverse the trend for sustainable growth? Would it ever be an option to consider selling that? The synergies, when you think about one BNY Mellon, I kind of get the rest of the firm being all one cohesive unit over time. How does asset management fit into that?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nSure. This is a question that we talked a little bit about last year. I said at the time that we think, and I'll underline the word think, that the business really can complement the strategy of the firm. We had more work to do and that was a thesis, and we needed to put in place the various different steps to really be able to operationalize and make the most of that. That's what we've been working on over the course of the few months.\nThe basic thesis is we think there's a strong industrial logic to have $2 trillion worth of manufacturing platform aligned to BNY Mellon's $3 trillion worth of retail distribution capacity. If you look across wealth and Pershing together, Pershing alone having $2.5 trillion+ of client assets on the platform.\nIf you only operated in a silo in investment management where it was manufacturing and only its own distribution, there's a legitimate question there about whether or not it would have the scale and the capacity to be able to truly compete. When you put it together with the rest of the company, we think there's a pretty compelling thesis there. We don't think we've properly capitalized on those benefits in the past. Our strategy is let's let investment management stretch its legs. In that new approach, we see some early signs of progress on that. We've been joining some dots.\nI mentioned a couple of things in my prepared remarks, both in terms of us having a broader distribution platform that actually can attract other investment managers who maybe don't have the benefit of our distribution, and they want to come join our platform, rounding out our offerings, and essentially making our distribution platform more complete, but also being attractive to them so they don't have to build their own, if you will, they're building their business on one of our platforms. We've given you our targets. We want to be able to expand the pre-tax margin in the business to over 25%.\nIt's not for nothing that we didn't grow expenses in that segment or in security services for that matter, because we're really focused on the margin in those businesses, and we have had some growth. This is about really working that set of opportunities. We'll see over the coming quarters how we do. This quarter was one where we felt we took an important step forward.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks very much. David mentioned it. Maybe it wasn't, maybe it wasn't that big of a deal. Q1 starts at the end of May. I'm curious if it was a big expense lift that we get some relief on going forward. Related to that, are there any headwinds on NII and any benefits on capital that we have to think about as a result of moving towards a more T+1 world? Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nT+1, we had to for sure spend money in different parts of the company in order to be able to ready ourselves for this. We view that as, frankly, ordinary course of business. There's always some market structure change going on in the world that we have to respond to. While they may be individually lumpy, there's always something. We just think about that as part of the expense of running the company and not something that will yield a particular benefit when we happen to have finished the work.\nNow, I do think that T+1 overall provides benefits to the financial system, improvements in efficiency, some risk reduction. I would say to the second part of your question that more of that probably accrues to our clients because we're not as big a principal player there. It can improve liquidity and capital requirements in the fullness of time. The industry's come a long way. You know, it wasn't that long ago that we're at T+5, T+3, sort of moving down the curve. I will also say from an opportunity point of view, not only do clients look to us to help them navigate these types of things because they're complicated and detailed, and they want us to essentially help them in executing this type of change.\nThat's exactly what we've been doing. We also think that there are just opportunities associated with these sorts of inflections because clients look at us, and it does sometimes cause the question to be raised of, huh, another big change in the post-trade landscape. Life's too short. I'm an investment manager or I'm a broker-dealer. I want to go about the core of my business. I don't have to worry about that stuff as much as I currently do. BNY Mellon, can you help us? Can you help us?\nMaybe there's a platform sale opportunity there for a little bit more outsourcing because as the world makes these changes, speeds up, gets more complicated, more change management, we of course have the benefit of scale. We get to change once, and we get to take some of those problems off their hands. I'd call that out when it comes to real time payments. I'd call it out in T+1. I'd call it out in clearing. Each time these things happen, we look at it through a lens of opportunity as well as a lens of client service. Overall, also just good for the market. Nothing good happens between trading and settlement, as is often said.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nGlenn, on the specific point about headwinds as it relates to NII, I look at the last two quarters together in terms of the strength of what we've done on NII, and I feel overall, we're in a good place. The balance sheet is very clean. Our CIO book is well positioned and kind of short duration. The CIO is doing a really good job at optimizing yield. When you see our securities that are maturing at the moment, they're rolling off at a kind of 2% to 3% rate and then are being deployed at current market yields.\nBased on what I see today, with the backup in rates that happened last week as a result of the hot inflation report, we feel pretty good about where things are for the balance of the year. Just using that forward curve, as I said earlier, rates up a little, down a little, do not materially impact us. We feel like our base case is we feel pretty good about it.\n\nGlenn Schorr\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is going to come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nBank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Robin. Hi, Dermot.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nHey, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nBank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nDermont, can you give us some color? I noticed you said in your prepared remarks the average loan balances were essentially flat in Q1 versus Q4. I noticed the spot number, the year-end or quarter-end number for loans was actually quite a bit higher, you know, around $73 billion versus the spot number in the Q4. Was something at the end of the quarter that caused that to increase?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Gerard. Again, it was a little bit of what I call the Good Friday effect, where clients use our overdraft facility mechanisms going into that weekend. That really caused the spot balances to go up, and that's kind of largely cleaned out, so has reverted more to the average numbers that you're familiar with.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nBank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay, good. I know this is not a big area for you guys, so maybe you could give us better insights since it's not as big as it is for a traditional bank. Can you maybe give us some color on the commercial real estate? I know you pointed out you've built up the allowances there. What are you guys seeing? Is it similar to what we're reading about and hearing from others, or is it something different?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nI would say, look, we're prudently marked in the commercial real estate portfolio. Overall, our commercial real estate portfolio in the context of our overall balance sheet is quite small, 3% of total loans, $2 billion. The reserve build that we took in Q1 was really just kind of being prudent on a couple of specific situations that are coming up for restructuring.\nI would let you know that they're all still paying, and everything is working, and they're class A office buildings, and we feel good about the occupancy. I would say overall, very, very clean and nothing that really has me unduly concerned. There has been a lot of chatter in the market, in the press over the last quarter about what's going to happen. I'm sure the backup in rates hasn't really helped that chatter.\nLike surveying other banks' results so far this quarter, I haven't really noticed any specific CRE bills on the back of what has been going on over the last couple of quarters. It does feel like, as a sentiment matter, to be quite muted at the moment on the back of others' earnings release, at least what I've observed.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nGerard, I just add to that for the more general view, which is I think the answer to what happens in commercial real estate. Clearly, it depends which markets you're involved in. There are some markets around the country that are more distressed than others. It continues to be focused on office, as you know, although there are certainly some questions on multifamily.\nThe fact that we're sort of still short housing in the US as a general matter is probably ultimately going to be helpful to that story. The single most important driver of it as we sit here today is where are longer term rates. There's so much chatter about what's going to happen in Fed funds. Is the Fed going to cut, are they going to stay, are they going to hike a little bit?\nWhat really matters is where's the curve from five to 10 years. As that backs up to the extent that we cross 5%, you get very different outcomes on commercial real estate than you do if 10 years are at 4%. If they ended up, for some reason—not our base case, but it's possible—you've got to plan for it. If they end up at 6%, then for some folks in the market that's going to be a much more painful outcome. I think you watch, so goes the 10 year to some extent, so goes the commercial real estate market, because this is a 2024 little bit, but really 2025 refinancing story.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nBank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Appreciate those insights. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of David Smith with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGood afternoon. Could you please help us think a little bit more about how far you are along in the efficiency opportunity journey? I know it's really never ending in some ways, but can you help us think about when the pace of improvement might start to decline as you get through more of the low hanging fruit.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks for the question. I was wondering when it was going to come. It's a multi-year journey and look, let's go back to last year and kind of go through it. Last year we kind of ended up at 2.7 versus a guide of 4 versus a previous year of 8. This year we've guided flat and we started Q1 on an operating basis of 1%. You'll see that our headcount, we've largely, you know, give or take a few hundred people, is largely flat. The headcount is flat. We feel like we have our arms wrapped around that. There's a lot going under the hood in terms of bringing in, like, growing our analyst class.\nHigh value location growth, et cetera, et cetera. We see a lot of opportunity to continue to improve the efficiency story. Also, as we both said in our prepared remarks, the migration to a new way of working, the platform operating model, over the next couple of years we feel will not only help us grow top line, but it will also just help us run the company better.\nI think it's quite important culturally that we don't really talk about efficiency internally. We talk about running our company better, which is very important strategically and also culturally. I think you're going to see quarter by quarter proof points on how we're able to run the company better, which will result in efficiency, which will then in turn result in improved margin. We feel very optimistic about what's coming.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThank you. Lastly, just to confirm the, you know, billion dollars or so of buyback in Q1, does that come out of the $6 billion new repurchase authorization, or is the $6 billion incremental to what you did in Q1?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nWe did an authorization last year which was $5 billion. We have a little bit left in that. It's just more of an administration thing that we decided to get another authorization this year for $6 billion. That's largely open ended. I wouldn't really dwell on the size of the authorization that much. It's just more of what we commit to you doing on an annual basis. The key thing for you to take away is we're committing to north of 100% this year.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Smith.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe most of them have been asked and answered, but maybe just a couple follow-ups. One, a little bit on that prior question. Dermot, I guess this could be for Robin as well. I think Robin, you mentioned earlier in the call, about 15% of staff are in the new operating model. Maybe if you could just talk about your migration plan over time and going back to what you just answered, Dermot, about the efficiency improvement should we be thinking of this over the long term as maybe roughly even between expenses and revenue, or still more geared towards expenses?\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nOkay, let me just start with the platform's operating model. Ultimately if you just go back to why are we doing what it is that we're doing, we've been pretty siloed as a company, as we've talked about before. We think that's a bad artifact. At least it's a bad artifact for a company like us, which is inherently a scale platforms provider. It's kind of the nature of our business, diversified, many different platforms, but largely at scale.\nTo have the separation of all of these pieces that are in support of that, and in some cases duplication, it just, in our opinion, wasn't the right way to run the company, so what is platform's operating model going to do? It's going to simplify how we work, it's going to improve the client experience, and it's going to create more empowerment for our employees. It's an opportunity to do things in one place, do them well, and elevate the quality of overall execution.\nWith that said, it sort of hits on the expense line as a benefit, and it hits on the revenue line as well. We've done, remember, we did a bunch of studies for this before we embarked on it, because pretty significant change. We also did some pilots, and to some extent we've even built new businesses using this operating rhythm because we built Wove in that way, and that wasn't entirely by accident.\nWe've had some xperience associated with all of that, and we feel pretty good therefore that we are going to get expense savings and revenue opportunities associated with it. We also think that from a cultural point of view, it's just an opportunity for our people because we think our people, and this is certainly what the data so far has shown, they just feel more empowered working in the model.\nThey can see a problem, they can get on it more quickly, they're more empowered to pull the levers to create change, and they no longer feel that maybe that they're part of a long chain of a bureaucracy to make change. On the efficiency opportunity thing, the thing I would add in answer to your question from what Dermot said earlier on is just to reinforce that there are short, medium, and long-term opportunities for efficiencies, and we've talked about it this way for a while now.\nAs Dermot said, we had to bend the cost curve last year. We thought it was very important, so we took a bunch of slightly tactical but nonetheless important and decisive changes. We also laid the groundwork for some medium-term saves. We talked about Project Catalyst, 1,500 ideas sourced from our employees, essentially delivering savings in 2023, in 2024, and 2025. Then we've got things that are longer term, like the platform's operating model, which are fundamentally changing the ways that people actually work.\nThat's a longer term opportunity. Probably get a little bit of benefit from that from 2024, but 2025 and 2026 are places where we'll probably see a bit more of that. In answer to Betsy's question from earlier on, we've been investing in AI. Now, that's definitely not a 2024 story for benefits, maybe not even 2025, but a 2026 and beyond story. We're layering in these different opportunities, recognizing that we wanted to take swift action, but then we also feel that we're laying the seeds for future efficiencies over time.\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nBrian, just to add on, I would just anchor you in a number. Like last year when we grew expenses by 2.7%, we invested $0.5 billion in new initiatives within that 2.7%. We're replicating that again this year. As somebody who's very close to the platform operating model strategy, the cultural point is when you walk the corridors of BNY Mellon now, you feel an energy and enthusiasm for our people, as Robin said, from embracing the model that hasn't been seen before. It is a very, very exciting strategy that's going on at the firm.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's fantastic color. Maybe just one last one on the speaking of initiatives, the Buy-side Trading Solutions initiative. I know we've had a lot of other initiatives talk about, so just maybe to get an update on how that's tracking.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah, this was. I'll take this one. This was always going to be a medium term thing. As we've told you, we sort of have this capability in house. It's a great example of platforms thinking it was captive in one bit of the company, only looking internally. We essentially made it fit for external use as well. We onboarded, as we told you last quarter, a large client onto that platform and that's been going very well.\nI have a lot of conversations with clients about how they could consider part of their trading desks to be outsourced. Sometimes it's all of it. Sometimes it's a region or a product that somebody wants to essentially say, hey, I'm not at scale. You're at scale. You're executing $1 trillion worth of volumes. Can I rent that capability from you? Essentially, we think there's a large addressable market here, but it's going to be. This is a longer sales process. The sales cycle of this takes longer. It's definitely a C-suite conversation but we continue to be cautiously optimistic about this over time.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks for all the color. Thanks so much.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. I know we're getting on here. I'll try to ask just a couple quick cleanups. First of all, this is the Q1 that the securities book has actually grown in absolute terms. I'm just wondering, is part of that an increased confidence in just where you do expect deposit to land, or was it more just opportunity costs of what your options were in the market?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nThanks, Ken. I would say very much the latter. When you look at the overall portfolio, think of cash and securities together. It was really the CIO team just optimizing yield and deploying cash where they see the opportunities.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Okay. Then I know you said a little bit of this before, but I was wondering if you could tighten up. You know, last quarter you said to Glenn's question, you talked about reinvesting at market rates. Last quarter you put that together and said that you would expect that this year's reinvestments to be 150 to 200 basis points on your roll on, roll off and with higher rates. I'm just wondering if you've kind of put that together for us. Like, what do you think that net benefit is now versus that 150 to 200?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nI think it's in the 200 ZIP code.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Then, last one, just duration of the portfolio. Can you just give us an update on where that stands?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nRoughly, two years, give or take? Yeah, two years is the best number to give you on that one.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, so to your point, like still keeping really short and opportunistic, correct?\n\nDermot McDonogh\n\nCFO, BNY Mellon\n\nYeah.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right, great. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nWhen you mentioned your comments about commercial real estate, I was just wondering. I don't think you have much exposure, but you highlighted that it's commercial real estate, I guess, for the industry or are you talking office? You said it's really a 2025 refinancing story. And as goes the 10-year, as goes commercial real estate. It just, it's good. Provide any color. Why did you highlight that and why do you have that sort of conclusion? Thanks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nWell, the question, Mike, was more general in nature. It wasn't really applying to us. Dermot talked a little bit about us in particular on commercial real estate. I think the question that was being asked was just using our vantage point. I think it was from Gerard, just using our vantage point in the world because we're not particularly invested in the space. What do we see in the world? Maybe as a slightly less conflicted observer and so I was just giving my perspective on it.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYes. From your perspective, I'm just curious, interested. As goes the 10-year, it's a 2025 refinancing story. Any color behind that?\nSure. At the end of the day as you look at the various different owners of Commercial Real Estate who have refinancings and they're looking at their own occupancy level, they're looking at their own maturity of their own debt stack, and they need to go out and they need to find refinancing. Of course, as you know better than anybody, when their debt stack starts to come due, that isn't a Fed funds type of refinancing because they're not for funding on very short dates and most of them, for understandable reasons, like to lock in funding as well.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThey're looking further out the curve. It's not precisely at the 10-year point, but my point really is the risk to refinancing in the Commercial Real Estate space is very correlated to the shape of the Treasury curve overall. Clearly, credit spreads matter as well, but it's a different proposition when you have the longer, call it 10 years, but it's probably a little inside of that part of the curve at 4% versus 5% versus 6. That was the purpose of my observation.\n\nMike Mayo\n\nManaging Directior and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right, that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin with any additional or closing remarks.\n\nRobin Vince\n\nPresident and CEO, BNY Mellon\n\nThank you, operator. I'd just like to wrap up by thanking our employees for their hard work to unlock the tremendous opportunity inside of BNY Mellon. We started the year with great momentum, delivered very solid results in Q1, and the pace of change continues to pick up. I want to thank our investors for their continued support. We appreciate your interest in BNY Mellon and thank you for your time today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The fourth quarter marked a solid close to a year in which we supported our clients in navigating through a challenging operating environment with geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty and evolving monetary policy. We started to show some early evidence that we can deliver higher financial performance in the near and medium term. We clarified our strategic priorities, and we laid a foundation for a multiyear transformation of our company for the long term.\nWith clearer focus on our direction of travel and having restored some confidence in our ability to deliver on our plans, today, we are publishing financial targets for each of our business segments and the firm overall. Dermot will review our fourth quarter financials, the outlook for 2024 and our medium-term financial targets in more detail. But let me first briefly address our performance in [indiscernible] year, not only highlight BNY Mellon's characteristic resilience, but they demonstrate the strength of our execution when we are appropriately organized and focused.\nOn a reported basis, 2023 earnings per share increased by 38% year-over-year. On a core basis excluding notable items, EPS of $5.05 increased by 10% year-over-year. Both pretax margin and return on tangible common equity improved on the back of significant operating leverage. Excluding notable items, we generated approximately 180 basis points of positive operating leverage. ROTCE improved 0.5 percentage point to 21.6%, and pretax margin improved roughly 80 basis points to 30%.\nMoving on to Page 3. At the beginning of last year, we communicated 3 financial goals for 2023. First, we expected to generate approximately 20% net interest revenue growth year-over-year. We delivered 24%. Second, we set out to halve our constant currency expense growth rate in 2022 to approximately 4% year-over-year expense growth, excluding notable items in 2023. We delivered 2.7%. And third, we sought to return north of 100% of 2023 earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We delivered 123%.\nOver the course of 2023, we returned $3.9 billion of capital to common shareholders all while having further strengthened our regulatory capital ratios to be well positioned for a wide range of macroeconomic and regulatory outcomes. Though we are still at the beginning of our transformation journey, our ability this past year, not just to deliver on our commitments but to exceed them, gives us confidence that we can affect meaningful change and consistently improve our financial performance over time.\nWhile mindful, there is a lot more work ahead of us. I'm proud of the effort that our people put in over the last 12 months as we embraced a focus on commerciality, accountability and efficiency, which drove these results. We are committed to improving the firm's financial performance in the near, medium and long term. And we have framed this work for our people with 3 strategic pillars, which we describe on Page 4.\nLast year, we introduced these 3 pillars to get at the heart of how we operate and who we are day-to-day for our clients, managing their money, moving it and keeping it safe. Pillar number one, be more for our clients; number two, run our company better; and number three, power our culture. They are deliberately simple, and our people are rallying around them. As I've said before, strategy is important but ultimately just a set of words. Actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot. I'm encouraged by the progress we made in 2023, some of which we highlight on Slide 5.\nOur global clients across governments, pension funds, mutual funds, unions, endowments, corporations, financial services firms and individuals both trust and want to do more business with us. And our analysis clearly shows there is more for them to do with us as we continue to partner alongside them to help achieve their ambitions.\nAs the global finance system grows and becomes ever more complex, demand for a trusted, resilient partner with the scale to service clients across the entire financial life cycle such as BNY Mellon grows as well. In 2023, we launched several new solutions that allow us to deepen our relationships with existing clients and to open the door to new ones.\nOf course, that includes the launch of Wove, Pershing's wealth advisory platform as well as the rollout of our buy-side trading solutions offering. But it goes far beyond these more visible product launches. All of our businesses are bringing new client solutions to the market. Bankify real-time payments on FedNow, white labeling Liquidity Direct, Bondwise, Intraday repo settlement BNY Mellon advisers are all examples. And in 2023, we filed more patent applications than ever before.\nAt the same time, we have an opportunity to bring more of BNY Mellon to clients who currently use us for just a single service. Last year, we hired our first Chief Commercial Officer as we began to operationalize our 1BNY Mellon initiative across the organization. As part of enhancing the organizational setup and focus of our client coverage organization, we created an integrated team to facilitate multiline of business solutions at scale, and we also formed a coverage practice group to implement consistency in approach and tooling.\nNext, while 2023 was a foundational year in what will be a multiyear journey to transform to a more streamlined and effective operating model, we took important steps toward running our company better to improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and be more intentional with how we spend so our investments in the business go further. We generate nearly double the amount of efficiency savings versus the prior year, which allowed us to self-fund over $0.5 billion of incremental investments. And we laid the foundation needed to transition to a platform's operating model, including successful pilots in 2 areas of the organization, which were important proof points as we start to unlock the power of our platforms in several phases over the next couple of years.\nWhile we focus on being more for our clients and running our company better, we know none of it can happen without our people, which is why we are powering our culture to make BNY Mellon a place where people are proud to work and excited to grow their careers. We elevated recruitment and retention programs, including welcoming the largest class of campus analysts in BNY Mellon's history, a class double the size of the previous year, and we're going to double it again this year. We launched our BK shares program to grant shares to the 45,000 employees who didn't previously receive stock as part of their compensation to cascade a sense of ownership and accountability across our company. And we rolled out enhanced employee benefits, recognizing value in fostering both a human and high-performing work environment.\nI'll wrap up where I began. We remain confident in the strength of our culture, our strategy and our ability to execute to help us unlock value for our clients, our shareholders and our people. 2023 was an important year in which we assembled more of the team that can deliver on what is needed, and we got ourselves pointed in the right direction for what we need to achieve. But it was also a year where being humble and resilient mattered.\nWhile we have a lot of work ahead of us, what has started as a theory and a belief now has early proof points, and we can see the possibility of what we can achieve. We have an ambitious agenda as we move forward, but I continue to be optimistic about the opportunity ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dermot.\n\nDermot William McDonogh\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm picking up on Page 6 of the presentation with our consolidated financials for the fourth quarter. And as Robin noted, I'm also going to speak to our 2024 outlook and medium-term targets, including how we are going to execute on our goals.\nFor the fourth quarter, our reported results reflect several notable items. Approximately $750 million of noninterest expense is related to the FDIC special assessment, severance and litigation reserves. And we had $150 million reduction in investment and other revenue primarily related to a fair value adjustment of a contingent consideration receivable.\nTotal revenue of $4.3 billion was up 10% year-over-year or up 2% excluding notable items. Total fee revenue was flat, reflecting 3% growth in investment services fees, which was offset by a 5% decline in Investment Management and performance fees and a 25% decline in foreign exchange revenue. Investment and other revenue was a negative $4 million in the quarter, reflecting the fair value adjustment that I mentioned before.\nNet interest revenue was up 4% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Expenses were up 20% year-over-year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 4%, reflecting higher investments and the impact of a weaker dollar as well as inflation, partially offset by savings.\nProvision for credit losses was $84 million primarily driven by reserve builds for commercial real estate exposure. Reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.33, pretax margin was 8%, and return on tangible common equity was 6%. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.28, pretax margin was 28%, and return on tangible common equity was 21%.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Page 7. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% remained largely unchanged, down 8 basis points to be precise compared to the prior quarter. Tier 1 capital remained essentially flat at $23.1 billion as the impacts of capital distributions to common shareholders and our redemption of $500 million preferred stock were offset by an improvement in AOCI and capital generation through earnings.\nAverage assets increased by 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting deposit inflows in the fourth quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 11.6%, which represents a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior quarter. CET1 capital was up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generation through earnings and the improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the impact of capital distributions to common shareholders. Risk-weighted assets increased by 1%.\nConsistent with the prior quarter, we returned $450 million of capital to our common shareholders through share repurchases, and we paid approximately $330 million of common stock dividends in the fourth quarter. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 117%, a 4 percentage point sequential decrease, primarily reflecting deposit inflows in the quarter, which are considered nonoperational until they are seasoned under our operational deposit model. And our consolidated net stable funding ratio remained roughly unchanged at 135%.\nNext, on Page 8, net interest revenue and additional details on the underlying balance sheet trends. Net interest revenue was $1.1 billion was up 4% year-over-year and up 8% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by balance sheet growth and changes in balance sheet mix. Total deposits averaged $273 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% sequentially, a strong finish to the year.\nInterest-bearing deposits were up 5%, and noninterest-bearing deposits remained flat. Interestingly, since August, we've seen 4 consecutive months of growth in average total deposit balances.\nOur team is highly engaged with our clients, and we're encouraged by the demand we've been seeing for our on-balance sheet liquidity solutions. While we are pleased with this stabilization, we remain vigilant preparing for a variety of different outcomes and financial conditions in 2024.\nOn the asset side, average interest-earning assets increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter. This includes cash and reverse repo up 5% and loan balances up 3%. The size of our investment securities portfolio decreased by 3% sequentially.\nMoving to our business segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 9. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, flat year-over-year. Investment services fees were up 1% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were flat as the positive impact of higher market levels, net new business and the weaker dollar was offset by lower client activity.\nWe ended the year on a high note with our strongest sales quarter of 2023, including wins in the Middle East, new mandates from several midsized investment managers and expanded mandates from some of our largest existing clients. And we saw continued strength in our ETF servicing business, where another quarter of strong net inflows capped a year of above-market growth.\nWithin Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 5%, reflecting healthy new business and higher client activity. Foreign exchange revenue was down 21% year-over-year on the back of lower volatility and lower volumes. And net interest revenue was down 3% year-over-year. Expenses of $1.7 billion were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and higher revenue-related expenses as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pretax income was approximately $460 million, representing a 21% pretax margin.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 10. This segment reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 6% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 1%, reflecting higher equity market values and higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of expected lost business. Net new assets were negative $4 billion for the quarter, also reflecting this expected loss business.\nIn Treasury Services, investment services fees increased by 5%, primarily reflecting higher client activity, partially offset by higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 16%, reflecting broad-based strength across Clearance and Collateral Management both in the U.S. and internationally.\nNet interest revenue increased by 10% year-over-year. Expenses of approximately $840 million were up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pretax income was approximately $630 million, representing a 42% pretax margin.\nTurning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 11. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $676 million, down 18% year-over-year. In Investment Management, revenue was down 26%, reflecting the fair value adjustment of the receivable and the impact of the prior year divestiture as well as the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by higher market values, seed capital gains and the weaker dollar.\nIn our Wealth Management business, revenue decreased by 3% driven by changes in product mix, partially offset by higher market values. Expenses of approximately $680 million were down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting efficiency savings and the impact of the divestiture in 2022, partially offset by higher investments, inflation and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Pretax income was a loss of $5 million. Excluding the impact of notable items, pretax income of $151 million increased 1% year-over-year and represented an 18% pretax margin. Assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows.\nIn the quarter, we saw $7 billion of net inflows into short-term strategies and $4 billion of net inflows into long-term active strategies, while we saw $10 billion of net outflows for index strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $312 billion increased by 16% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows.\nPage 12 shows the results of the Other segment. Total revenue improved year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of a net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio recorded in fourth quarter of 2022 and expenses of $693 million included $505 million related to the FDIC special assessment.\nHaving reviewed our results, I will now turn to Page 14 and our current outlook for 2024. We're entering the year on a strong footing, and we set ourselves up determined to at least break even from an operating leverage perspective. Considering our healthy pipeline across the businesses, we expect fee revenue growth to turn positive in 2024.\nWith regards to net interest revenue, our expectation for an approximately 10% decrease year-over-year is based on the assumption of market-implied forward interest rates, and we assume ongoing quantitative tightening puts further downward pressure on deposit balances. We intend to keep expenses excluding multiple items roughly flat in 2024.\nAnd finally, with regard to capital management, we expect to return north of 100% of 2024 earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As Robin discussed earlier, 2023 was a foundational year for us. We took decisive actions to demonstrate some early evidence of our ability to deliver stronger financial performance. And importantly, we've developed a clear road map for our multiyear transformation.\nOver the next couple of slides, we'll provide you our medium-term financial targets for the firm and some of the most impactful actions we're taking to keep delivering on our goals. Page 15 summarizes our consolidated targets.\nIt is our goal to improve the firm's pretax margin to 33% and our ROTCE to 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet. I'll double-click on our business segments in a moment, but along our 3 strategic pillars, there are a number of teams that transcend our lines of business and segments. Robin mentioned several of these when he talked about our progress in '23. So I'll highlight just a few of them.\nThe first is our enhanced commercial model. We're driving a new culture of commerciality to deliver all of BNY Mellon in a unified front to facilitate deeper client relationships with solutions from across the firm. With our clients at the center, our model is led by client coverage teams with clear accountability to retain business, expand revenue into new areas and drive client satisfaction.\nOur new sales operations and enablement organization, the client coverage practice, will make it easier for our clients to do more business with BNY Mellon and create consistent commercial roles, tools and support internally for an enhanced and more efficient sales experience. And what we call integrated solutions represent a new, more focused approach to assembling components from multiple client platforms into repeatable go-to-market capabilities that span across our lines of business, driving better value for our clients and higher profitable growth.\nThe second one I'd like to highlight is our transition to our platform's operating model. By grouping similar activities together into logical platforms and uniting related capabilities, we are enabling the streamlining of internal processes to drive higher efficiency and further enhance resiliency and risk management. Our model is based on 2 types of platforms: client platforms will own the delivery of a commercial solution to our external clients, while enterprise platforms will own the delivery of internal services. Over the past few months, we've developed a detailed implementation approach, and our transition into this new model will be gradual and deliberate, starting with the first implementation wave this spring.\nAnd the third is our culture. People come to BNY Mellon to make an impact on global financial markets. While we focus on driving growth and running our company better, none of it can happen without our people. That's why we're making meaningful investments, including an enhanced learning, development and feedback to foster exciting careers.\nMoving to our segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 16. Here, we are reiterating our existing 30% pretax margin target. Over the past 24 months, we've improved the margin from 21% in 2021 to 25% in 2023. We're pleased with the performance of the business over the past 2 years, but we appreciate that the path from 25% to 30% will be the harder yards.\nFirst of all, we're firmly focused on driving down the cost to serve. We have and we continue to make significant investments in uplifting several platforms that support core services, including fund accounting, tax services, corporate actions and loan administration. Additionally, we continue going after inefficient processes. Over the past couple of years, we cataloged all of these processes and we've made some good progress in our digitization efforts, but there's more work to do.\nWe're also taking a more strategic approach to deepening client relationships going forward. Using enhanced tools to better understand client behavior, quality of service, economics and revenue opportunities, we are expanding wallet share and improving client profitability.\nLast but not least, we're pursuing several opportunities to drive an acceleration of underlying growth. On the back of our investments over the years, we have become a premier provider of ETF servicing globally, and we expect to maintain our strong momentum through continued innovation. Similarly, in private markets, another one of the fastest-growing market segments, we've established a strong market position with more room to expand our capability set.\nMoving on to MarkETF and Wealth Services on Page 17. As you can see on the left side of the page, this segment has a good track record of solid growth and attractive margins. Our focus here is to accelerate growth through deliberate investments without compromising profitability.\nI'll start with Pershing, our company's second largest line of business. As the #1 clearing firm for broker-dealers and a top 3 RIA custodian, Pershing benefits from a strong position in one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, i.e. the U.S. wealth market. Notwithstanding near-term headwinds from the events of 2023, we are confident that our investments in the core platforms and client experience will drive further market share gains in the attractive market segment of the growing $1 billion-plus RIAs and hybrid broker-dealers.\nAnd our Wove platform continues to gain momentum. As we're capturing business from existing clients and new opportunities to deliver the platform, data and investment solutions, we're currently projecting $30 million to $40 million of incremental revenue from Wove in 2024.\nIn Treasury Services, we're benefiting from a strong position with financial institutions, and we're one of the top 5 U.S. dollar payments tiers in the world. Leveraging this strong position, we're selectively expanding our reach by targeting new clients, geographic and product segments. For example, we've been adding bankers to drive growth with e-commerce and NBFI clients, and the completion of multiyear uplift of our payments platform is expected to drive an increase to our Swift market share through growth in several geographies. Additionally, by joining forces with our markets business, which provides FX solutions in over 100 currencies, Treasury Services will enhance the FX capabilities that it can provide its clients.\nRounding out the segment, Clearance and Collateral Management. As a primary provider of settlement for all U.S. government securities trades and the largest global collateral manager in the world, we have a special role in financial markets and we're taking this role very seriously. No doubt this business grows as markets grow, but we're not resting on our position. Our Clearance and Collateral Management business is one of the most innovative in the company. And so we're confident that this business can maintain its healthy growth trajectory by continuously launching new flexible collateral management solutions that position our clients to meet their growing liquidity needs and by continuing to increase collateral mobility and optimization across global client venues.\nNext, Investment and Wealth Management on Page 18. The Investment and Wealth Management reported a pretax margin of 12% for the full year 2023 or 17% excluding notable items. Our plan is to improve the segment margin to 25% or higher over the medium term on the back of a combination of growth and efficiency initiatives.\nFirst, we're unlocking BNY Mellon's distribution power for the benefit of our investment firms and our clients. Most importantly, we're in the process of creating a firm-wide distribution platform that combines in-house products with offerings from select third-party managers to provide best-in-class solutions. Additionally, we're making enhancements to how we're offering Dreyfus cash products across our enterprise-wide open architecture liquidity ecosystem to improve visibility, and hence, platform share.\nSecond, we're expanding our products and solutions with a focus on scaling our investment capabilities across Investment Management, Wealth Management and Pershing. And third, we're driving efficiency and scale by realizing the benefits as multiyear infrastructure investment programs are nearing completion and by better leveraging the enterprise to transform fragmented and subscale support activities into scaled enterprise platforms.\nMoving on to our capital management philosophy on Page 19. BNY Mellon benefits from a capital-light business model that allows us to drive organic growth while typically returning nearly 100% of earnings to our common shareholders over time. Over the past 10 years, the firm grew dividends per share at an 11% CAGR and returned almost 100% of earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. Our philosophy for capital deployment and capital distribution remains unchanged.\nWe've entered the year with strong capital ratios at or above our management target of approximately 5.5% to 6% Tier 1 leverage and approximately 11% CET1. And assuming interest rates follow market-implied forwards, we expect to generate additional excess capital from the unrealized loss related to AFS securities pulling to par over time.\nWrapping up on Page 20. Over the past year, we conducted thorough strategic reviews, we developed detailed business and financial plans, and we've taken the first steps on what will be a multiyear transformation of our company. Our business plans drive as achieving what we laid out across our 3 strategic pillars: being more for our clients, run our company better and power our culture. And our financial plans aim to improve the firm's pretax margin to 33% and our ROTCE to 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nIn publishing our medium-term financial targets, together with our most important strategic priorities and the actions that will help us achieve them, we are providing transparency to allow you all to track our progress, and we are confident that we will deliver. We are excited about the work ahead of us, and today is an important milestone for our team. Now for those of you who are still with us, we promised to let you start your long weekend soon.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line?",

Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2023, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nVice Chair & CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get to the earnings call, I'd like to address the horrific terrorist attack on Israel and the ongoing conflict in the surrounding region. We're heartbroken as we continue to witness a human tragedy unfold. And I'm immensely grateful and proud of our employees in Israel, who, despite everything that they have been going through, continue to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients. Our heart go out to colleagues, clients and community members in the region.\nNow I'll share some brief comments about our financial results for the third quarter and will then give a quick overview of some of our strategic priorities. BNY Mellon delivered solid financial performance and continued progress on the steady transformation of our company.\nAs you can see on Slide 2 of the financial highlights presentation, we reported earnings per share of $1.22 versus $0.39 in the third quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, which primarily impacted last year's results, EPS of $1.27 increased by 5% year-over-year.\nWe generated a return on tangible common equity of 20% on $4.4 billion of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and a pretax margin of 29% in the third quarter. These results once again highlight the efficacy of our prudent and proactive asset and liability management amid a rapidly evolving operating environment.\nNet interest revenue was up 10% year-over-year as we continued to maximize the positive aspects of rising interest rates. Our strong liquidity position allowed us to reduce our wholesale funding footprint. And despite the significant steepening of the curve, unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio remained well contained.\nOur 20% return on tangible common equity, together with all of these actions, allowed us to continue to deliver attractive capital returns to our shareholders while further strengthening our capital and liquidity ratios to be prepared for a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes.\nAs I've just rounded out the first 12 months in my seat, I'd like to take a step back for a moment and reflect on our work to date and where we're headed. Through a series of strategic reviews, we have affirmed what we believe to be our key assets. Number one, our client reach and breadth of engagement. Our top-tier clients from all regions of the world both trust and want to do more business with us.\nNumber two, our collection of market-leading businesses. We're a broad-based financial services company with a balance and diversification that makes us stronger. And our unique business mix sets us apart from our competitors.\nAnd number three, our culture of teamwork. Our people are naturally collegial and seek out opportunities to work together to serve our clients and communities. These assets are hard to replicate, and it's rare that they exist together. But as I have acknowledged before, the company's long-term financial performance track record hasn't lived up to the quality of this franchise.\nAs a result, we've committed to drive higher underlying growth, consistently deliver positive operating leverage and improve our pretax margin over time. As an important mark of clarity and focus to help tie together where we are heading and why, we recently communicated 3 strategic pillars to our employees around the world: one, be more for our clients; two, run our company better; and three, power our culture. These 3 pillars are not fundamentally changing the businesses we're in. Instead, they drive at how we operate and who we are day to day for our clients.\nAs I've said before, strategy is important but ultimately, just a set of words. Actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot. While this was just 1 quarter in what will be a multiyear transformation, I'm optimistic about the steady improvements we are seeing inside of BNY Mellon. And I want to share with you some of this perspective that gives us confidence that we're on the right track with the work that we are doing under each of these pillars.\nFirst, I'm encouraged by the pace of progress towards making BNY Mellon a better-run company. Our businesses have historically operated largely in silos. We've run somewhat like a corporate conglomerate with a holding company that owns a series of vertically self-sufficient subsidiaries. This has led to clunky client journeys, wasteful duplication and a lack of joined-up thinking.\nWe have many opportunities to run our company better and more efficiently to reduce bureaucracy. And we need to be smart and disciplined with how we spend so our investments in the business go further.\nI've talked to you before about our efficiency initiative, comprising about 1,500 ideas developed by those who often see items ripe for improvement most clearly and closely: our people. This program, internally we call it Project Catalyst, is well underway. And we started to see some early benefits in our financial results.\nAs you may recall, in January, we set out to essentially halve our expense growth rate this year to roughly 4% growth excluding notable items compared to roughly 8% ex currency in 2022. We have made good progress against this goal. With less than 3 months left in the year, we are confident that we will outperform our 4% expense growth target for 2023 all while self-funding over $0.5 billion of incremental investments this year.\nAs we've started the budgeting process for 2024, we are determined to bend the cost curve further. We're now working to adopt a platform's operating model, which will help us to do things in one place, do them well and elevate overall execution. And we're embracing new technologies so we can be more productive, more efficient and focused on growth.\nAutomation of processes and investment in operations digitization and AI across the firm will make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and subsequently channel their energies toward new innovations, which brings me to our work towards being more for our clients.\nOur financial results in the quarter tell a tale of 2 cities. Against the backdrop of seasonally slower summer months, we once again saw outperformance in some of our differentiating businesses. Strength in Clearance and Collateral Management continued. And we saw a healthy underlying growth in Pershing as well as solid momentum in Asset Servicing. This was offset by continued softness in Investment Management fees and lower exchange revenue, given the subdued market backdrop.\nOur path to higher underlying growth is clear. In addition to always being on the hunt for new clients, we have to deliver more to our existing clients, develop new products and do a better job at connecting the adjacent ones.\nOur new Chief Commercial Officer has hit the ground running as we start operationalizing One BNY Mellon across the organization to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm. At the same time, we're pushing forward with innovative new client solutions that leverage the adjacencies among our businesses.\nWhile still early days, initial client wins with our recently launched solutions as well as the quality of our pipelines are encouraging. Pershing X's new open architecture Wealth Management platform, Wove, is off to a promising start, including a couple of client agreements already signed, several prospective clients in active contracting and a steadily growing pipeline.\nAs an example, Integrity, a nationwide insurance and financial services firm with a network of over 0.5 million agents and advisers, has selected our Wove platform to support their wealth management business. With Wove, we are also connecting solutions from across BNY Mellon. For example, Integrity will have access to third-party models and institutional-grade solutions from our specialist firms in Investment Management and broker-dealer clearing and custody solutions through Pershing.\nIn another example, Pershing expanded their long-standing relationship with Lincoln Investment as the company transitioned their self-clearing business on to Pershing's custodial platform and selected Wove to provide a suite of technology solutions to its financial professionals.\nAs we onboard additional clients through the remainder of 2023, we are planning to start disclosing relevant financial information and leading indicators for you all to keep track of Wove's growth trajectory at the beginning of next year. We also signed the first external client, a leading G-SIB owned European asset manager for our recently launched buy-side trading solutions.\nWithout a doubt, we expect our more prominent solutions like Wove and buy-side trading to move the needle on growth over time. But we are leaning into innovation to solve the evolving client challenges across all of our businesses.\nFor example, in Treasury Services, we were one of the first banks to go live on FedNow, the Federal Reserve's new instant payment rail. This allows us to expand our capabilities for corporations, nonbank financial institutions and fintechs. And as a service provider, we are helping our financial institutions clients access instant payments, remain competitive and provide best-in-class service for their customers.\nAs another example, this quarter, the business announced the launch of Bankify, an open banking payment solution that as an alternative to credit or debit cards and third-party payment platforms helps organizations receive consumer payments from bank accounts with a seamless user experience and guaranteed settlement.\nLet me conclude by saying that we are optimistic about the opportunity in front of us. And our strategic objectives for the short, medium and long term are clear. We are innovating and pushing forward on our multiyear growth investments, all the while remaining disciplined to deliver positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion.\nAs I've said all along, the path to transforming BNY Mellon into a consistently high-performing company will take some time. But for 2023, we are on track to deliver what we said we'd deliver at the beginning of the year while making steady progress toward our strategic priorities. I'm proud and appreciative of our people's dedication to be more for our clients, run our company better and power our culture, collectively to unlock BNY Mellon's potential.\nWith that, over to you, Dermot.\n\nDermot William McDonogh\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Page 3 of the presentation with our consolidated financial results for the third quarter.\nTotal revenue of $4.4 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Net interest revenue was up 10% year-over-year primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by balance sheet size and mix. Fee revenue was flat.\nGrowth on the back of higher market values, net new business and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar was offset by the Alcentra divestiture in the fourth quarter last year, lower foreign exchange revenue and the mix of AUM flows. Firm-wide assets under custody/administration of $45.7 trillion were up 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, the weaker dollar and net new business.\nAssets under management of $1.8 trillion were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting the weaker dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the Alcentra divestiture. Investment and other revenue was $113 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income trading.\nExpenses were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis primarily reflecting the goodwill impairment associated with our Investment Management reporting unit in the third quarter last year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 3% year-over-year.\nProvision for credit losses remained low at $3 million in the quarter as the impact of reserve builds to reflect continued uncertainty on the outlook for commercial real estate was largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions.\nAs Robin noted earlier, reported earnings per share were $1.22. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.27, representing 5% growth year-over-year.\nWe delivered positive operating leverage. Our pretax margin was 29%, and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 20%.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Consistent with the prior quarter, we returned $450 million of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases. And we paid approximately $330 million of dividends to our common stockholders, reflecting our previously announced 14% dividend increase, which became effective in the third quarter. Taken together, we returned 82% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter or 107% on a year-to-date basis.\nOur Tier 1 leverage ratio improved sequentially by approximately 40 basis points to 6.1%, reflecting a decrease in average assets and an increase in Tier 1 capital driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returns through buybacks and dividends. Unrealized losses related to available-for-sale securities remained roughly unchanged in the quarter.\nThe CET1 ratio was 11.4%, representing an approximately 30 basis point improvement compared with the prior quarter, reflecting lower risk-weighted assets and an increase in CET1 capital. Just like our regulatory capital ratios, our liquidity ratios further strengthened in the quarter. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 121%, a 1 percentage point improvement compared with the prior quarter. And our consolidated net stable funding ratio was 136%, well in excess of the regulatory requirements.\nNext, on Page 5, net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1 billion was down 8% quarter-over-quarter driven by changes in balance sheet size and mix, partially offset by higher interest rates.\nAs we expected, temporary deposits related to the debt ceiling impasse in the second quarter left in July. And along with seasonally low balances in August, average deposits for the quarter decreased by 5% sequentially.\nIn line with our expectations, interest-bearing deposits were down 3%, and noninterest-bearing deposits were down 16%. You will remember from prior earnings calls that we expected noninterest-bearing deposits to moderate to approximately 20% of total deposits in the second half of this year, which is consistent with our deposit mix in the third quarter.\nFollowing seasonal troughs in August, we saw the anticipated pickup in monthly average balances in September and again, some modest growth in the first 2 weeks of October. Average interest-earning assets were down by 6% quarter-over-quarter. This reflects a reduction in cash and reverse repo by 11%, while we actively reduced wholesale funding. Our investment securities portfolio was down 4%, and loan balances were up 1%.\nMoving to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were down 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 3% excluding notable items. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher investment and revenue-related expenses, the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar as well as inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture.\nI'll talk more about our outlook for expenses in a moment. But as Robin mentioned earlier, it is worth highlighting that for 2023, we are expecting to fully self-fund over $0.5 billion of incremental investments through efficiency savings.\nTurning to our business segments starting with Securities Services on Page 7. As I discussed the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the Investment Services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement.\nSecurities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year. The revenue was flat. 2% growth in Investment Services fees was offset by a 19% decline in foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower volatility and volumes. Net interest revenue was up 12%.\nIn Asset Servicing, Investment Services fees were up 3% driven by higher market values, healthy net new business and a weaker dollar, partially offset by lower client transaction activity. The strength of our balance sheet as well as the stability, breadth and depth of our solutions remain clear differentiators that position us well with clients confronted with a persistently challenging market environment and an evolving competitive landscape.\nFor example, ETF assets under custody/administration were up over 20% year-over-year, and the number of funds serviced on our platform continued to grow at a healthy clip. In all, assets under custody/administration and related Investment Services fees both grew in the mid-single-digit percentage range despite the number of fund launches having slowed significantly over the past year.\nWith the initial [indiscernible], Investment Services fees were down 2%. Growth from net new business and Corporate Trust was more than offset by the absence of fees from elevated Depositary Receipt cancellation activity in the third quarter of last year.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%, and net interest revenue increased by 6%.\nIn Pershing, Investment Services fees were up 2%, reflecting higher fees on sweep balances, partially offset by the impact of lost business and lower transaction volumes consistent with the decline in U.S. equity exchange volumes. Despite the continued headwind from the ongoing deconversion of the regional bank client highlighted in the second quarter, Pershing saw $23 billion of net new assets on the platform this quarter, reflecting positive momentum in the underlying business.\nAs Robin mentioned earlier, the momentum around Wove is building with both new and existing clients. While at the same time, ongoing investments in the core Pershing platform to enhance adviser experience and lead with innovative solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on the heightened pace of change in the RIA community.\nIn Treasury Services, Investment Services fees decreased by 1% as growth from higher client activity was offset by higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances. In Clearance and Collateral Management, Investment Services fees were up 16%, reflecting broad-based growth across U.S. and international Clearance and Collateral Management.\nIn particular, we saw strength in domestic clearance volumes, reflecting elevated volatility and U.S. treasury issuance activity and continued migration from the Fed's reverse repo facility to traditional tri-party collateral management balances. Recent macro trends, including heightened volatility, uncertainty associated with monetary policy and bank's regulatory capital requirements as well as the recent consolidation in the banking sector further reinforce the value of our tri-party collateral management service. In addition to expanding our platform both in the U.S. and internationally, we continue to innovate new solutions for our clients to better utilize their collateral.\nTurning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $827 million, down 4% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 2%, and net interest revenue declined 33% year-over-year.\nAssets under management of $1.8 trillion increased by 3% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this increase reflects the weaker dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the Alcentra divestiture.\nIn the quarter, we saw $15 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies, driven by client derisking and rebalancing and $7 billion of net inflows into short-term strategies led by our [indiscernible] money market fund complex.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the Alcentra divestiture and the mix of AUM flows, partially offset by higher performance fees as well as the impact of higher market values and the weaker dollar.\nIn our Wealth Management business, revenue decreased by 5% driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix, partially offset by higher market values. Client assets of $292 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows.\nPage 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with our current outlook for the rest of the year. Based on market-implied forward interest rates at the end of last month, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year '23 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year.\nMoving to expenses. We are making good progress on bending the cost curve while protecting our important investments to accelerate growth and deliver superior client experiences.\nWhere we sit today, I am confident that we will outperform the target of 4% expense growth, excluding notable items, that we communicated in January. And we remain determined to drive that growth rate down to 3% for the full year '23. This reflects our expectation for a sequential step-up in expenses, excluding notable items, in the fourth quarter with seasonally higher business development expenses as well as discrete increases for professional services and occupancy.\nAnd finally, we expect to continue stock buybacks at a pace consistent with the second and third quarter. This is in line with our full year outlook to return 100% of earnings or more to shareholders over the course of '23 while maintaining our strong capital ratios, mindful of the significant uncertainties relating to the operating environment.\nIn conclusion, our financial results this quarter highlight the effectiveness of our balance sheet management and tangible progress on our journey towards higher operational efficiency and scalability. While we have more work to do, our teams around the world are embracing change. And our pace of bringing innovative new client solutions to the market gives us confidence that revenue growth will follow over time.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com.\nI'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks, and Dermot will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 18, 2023, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nVice Chair & CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThanks, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Dermot will walk you through the financials for the quarter shortly. But in summary, the company delivered good financial performance amid a very dynamic operating environment, and we continue taking actions to position the firm for higher underlying growth and enhanced operational efficiency over time.\nReferring to Slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, BNY Mellon reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.30, which was up 26% year-over-year on $4.5 billion of revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Consistent with our focus on driving pretax margin expansion in 2023 and beyond, we drove meaningful positive operating leverage as we maintained strong expense discipline while continuing to make significant investments to improve our growth trajectory and transform our operating model.\nAs a result, our pretax margin improved to 30%, and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 23% in the quarter. As I've said many times before, disciplined execution and consistent progress from milestone to milestone is the key to unlocking the financial opportunity inherent in our high-quality franchise. While we're conscious of the work ahead of us, we're pleased to see the momentum building across the company.\nFirst, we're getting an increasingly firm grip on our expense base. I'm proud of our people who are embracing the task of making BNY Mellon a more efficient and scalable company, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver tangible results in 2023 and beyond.\nRemember, in January, we committed to essentially cut expense growth in half this year, roughly 4% growth excluding notable items in 2023 compared to roughly 8% ex currency in 2022. Halfway through the year, I'm pleased to report that we're on track, even a little ahead of our plans.\nSecond, the strength of our balance sheet, the resiliency of our business model and our proactive balance sheet management continue to differentiate us with clients and create value for our shareholders. Net interest revenue and deposits were both bright spots in the quarter, and the Federal Reserve's 2023 bank stress test demonstrated our capacity to withstand an extreme stress scenario. As a result of the test, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at the regulatory floor of 2.5%. And while our overall approach to returning capital to shareholders remains unchanged, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 14% to $0.42 starting this quarter.\nThird, we remain laser-focused on driving sustainably higher underlying growth across the firm. We've talked before about the advantages of our business model. Businesses such as Clearance and Collateral Management, Pershing, Depository Receipts, Corporate Trust and Treasury Services offer us a breadth and diversification in comparison to traditional trust banks.\nWe saw strength in some of these differentiated businesses in the second quarter, and new business pipelines are healthy across the board. And importantly, we continued pushing ahead with new innovative client solutions that we expect to become growth accelerators for the medium and long term.\nLess than 2 years after hiring employee #1, Pershing X is now live with Wove, our open architecture wealth management platform that addresses a major pain point in the advisory market by better integrating advisers' core applications. Wove allows us to integrate some of the best solutions from around BNY Mellon, including from our Investment Management business as well as from leading third-party fintechs.\nOur launch of Pershing's Insight conference in June has garnered significant early enthusiasm from clients and industry influencers who see Wove as a promising solution. The client pipeline is growing nicely, which we will report on more in the quarters ahead.\nMore broadly, Wove is a proof point of our ability to execute at speed. We can deliver leading solutions quickly when we empower our people, surround them with the expertise and tools that they need and drive forward with a product mindset, leveraging our great platforms. It's also a reflection of the change in mindset we are cultivating here, more commercially oriented with a greater sense of ownership and a greater focus on execution.\nI'll also call out Treasury Services, which continues to innovate in areas like faster payments and Banking as a Service. This quarter, the business announced a strategic alliance with Mobility Capital Finance or MoCaFi, a black-founded fintech whose mission is to enable underserved communities to access banking services. This is just the latest example of how we are deploying our capabilities to advance financial inclusion in an innovative way.\nNow I've spoken in the past about the opportunity to do more things for our clients by connecting the dots for them through our ONE BNY Mellon initiative and how we're going to operationalize that. To help us realize this potential and more broadly, to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm, in May, we welcomed Cathinka Wahlstrom as our first Chief Commercial Officer and member of our Executive Committee.\nIn addition to taking on oversight responsibilities for global client management, I've tasked Cathinka to embed ONE BNY Mellon into the operations of our company. It's important that we commercialize this opportunity through training, by properly incentivizing our people to collaborate across the firm and by developing deliberate approaches to multiproduct solutions.\nStepping back for a moment, let me provide a few thoughts on the macro environment. We acknowledge that the path of interest rates, continued QT and elevated U.S. treasury issuance activity carry meaningful uncertainties for the environment in the months ahead.\nFrom our vantage point as the primary clearer of U.S. treasuries and through touching roughly 20% of the world's investable assets, our data tells us that more than half of recent T-bill issuance has been absorbed by funds flowing out of the Fed's RRP, but a good chunk of the balance has come from the banking system. Most of the money market fund demand for T-bills has been concentrated at the very front end as funds have been less comfortable extending duration past the end of July, ahead of an expected rate hike later this month and continued uncertainty on the path of rates thereafter.\nWe're also not seeing much foreign demand as cross-border flows into U.S. treasuries of all maturities are negative and have been for some time. Together, this is likely going to put some incremental pressure on domestic funding sources, funds, banks and corporates as well as state and local governments to absorb upcoming supply unless T-bill prices cheapen materially from current levels.\nFor this reason, we do expect some further pressure on deposit balances across the industry in the months ahead. As you would expect, we're optioning ourselves prudently given these uncertainties but see these flows as benefiting our broader cash ecosystem.\nWe manage over $1.3 trillion worth of cash on behalf of clients across deposits, money market funds, repos and securities lending. And we're the biggest provider of collateral services globally as well with about $6 trillion of [indiscernible] balances on our platform. This $7 trillion of relevance to money market flows allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various short-term investment alternatives and allows us to help our clients find the right solutions for their investment needs.\nLet me conclude my comments on a reflective mode. As I've acknowledged before, strategy matters, but execution and culture matter even more. As we close the books on the second quarter, we're entering the back half of the year with good momentum and confidence in our ability to drive change by executing consistently and at pace.\nOver the past couple of years, we've been able to attract high-caliber talent to upgrade multiple important roles across the company. Our existing team, together with these new leaders, are rising to the challenge of unlocking our potential. And it's clear to me that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us by leveraging our unique combination of businesses, our preeminent client franchise and the power of our culture and people. I'm encouraged by the initial progress over the past couple of quarters and excited about what lies ahead.\nWith that, over to you, Dermot.\n\nDermot William McDonogh\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Page 3 of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the second quarter.\nTotal revenue of $4.5 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Net interest revenue was up 33% year-over-year primarily driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix. Fee revenue was down 2% driven by the sale of Alcentra in the fourth quarter, the mix of cumulative AUM net inflows and lower FX revenue on the back of lower volumes and volatility, partially offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers.\nFirm-wide AUC/A of $46.9 trillion increased by 9% year-over-year. This increase reflects the impact of higher market values, client inflows and net new business. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 2% year-over-year. The impact of lower market values driven by a year-over-year decrease in the U.K. fixed income markets and the sale of Alcentra was partially offset by cumulative net inflows over the last year and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.\nInvestment and other revenue was $97 million. We continue to see strength in fixed income trading and positive [indiscernible] results. Expenses were flat on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This was driven by higher investments and revenue-related expenses and the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings in the Alcentra divestiture.\nProvision for credit losses was $5 million in the quarter, reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast, resulting in higher reserves relating to commercial real estate, largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions. As Robin mentioned earlier, earnings per share were $1.30, up 26% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items. Pretax margin continued to improve to 30%. Our return on tangible common equity improved to 23%.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our regulatory capital ratios remained roughly unchanged. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7%, down 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by an increase in average assets. Tier 1 capital increased slightly driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returns through buybacks and dividends. The CET1 ratio was 11.1%, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily reflecting higher CET1 capital.\nAs we said on our earnings call in April, we tapered buybacks in the second quarter to maintain conservative buffers above our management targets being mindful of the uncertain environment. Overall, we returned 72% of earnings, including approximately $300 million of common dividends and approximately $450 million of buybacks in the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 119% of earnings.\nThe consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 120%, an increase of 2 percentage points compared with the prior quarter. Our consolidated net stable funding ratio, which we are reporting publicly for the first time this quarter, was 136%, well in excess of the regulatory requirements.\nMoving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was down 2% quarter-over-quarter driven by deposit mix shift, partially offset by higher interest rates. Overall, deposit balances have remained elevated relative to our expectations as they increased 1% sequentially on an average basis.\nInterest-bearing deposits were up 5%. Noninterest-bearing deposits were down 11%, in line with our expectations. Average interest-earning assets increased by 4% quarter-over-quarter. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo was up 15%. Loan balances were flat. Our investment securities portfolio was down 5%.\nTurning to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items relating to litigation and severance. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects higher investments and revenue-related expenses and the impact of inflation, partially offset by efficiency savings and the Alcentra divestiture.\nTo summarize, we continue pushing forward with our multiyear investments to increase the growth trajectory of the firm and transform our operating model for greater scalability over time. Importantly, we remain focused on driving positive operating leverage and delivering continued pretax margin expansion. As an example of the expense discipline that Robin mentioned, for the second quarter, we self-funded the entirety of our incremental investment spend and importantly, are on course to do the same for the full year.\nTurning to our business segments, starting with Securities Services on Page 7. As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the investment services themes for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement.\nSecurities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 2%. Within this, investment services fees were flat. FX revenue was down 20% on the back of lower volatility and volume. Net interest revenue was up 46%.\nIn Asset Servicing, investment services fees were flat with healthy underlying growth from new and existing clients, offset by lower client transaction activity, reflecting the current market environment. Importantly, strength in attractive market segments continued. Despite an industry slowdown for private markets and hedge fund launches, we saw strong growth in our [indiscernible] servicing business. High single-digit growth, both ETF AUC/A and number of funds serviced continued.\nWithin Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 3% driven by our Depository Receipts. Here, the impact of a large client corporate action in the current quarter was tempered by the absence of Russia-related client activity in the second quarter of last year.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. Net interest revenue increased by 24%.\nIn Pershing, investment services fees were up 4%. The increase reflects the abatement of money market [indiscernible] and higher fees on [indiscernible] balance, partially offset by lower transaction volumes, consistent with the decline in U.S. equity exchange volumes and the impact of lost business. The net new assets number was a negative $34 billion in the quarter, reflecting the deconversion of a regional bank client that was acquired in May.\nExcluding the impact of this ongoing deconversion, which we expect to weigh on our reported net new assets for several quarters, net new assets grew at a mid-single-digit annualized growth rate. We remain confident in Pershing's underlying momentum and prospects. Importantly, our continued investments to enhance Pershing's core platform as well as the business' access to the strength and breadth of the whole company is being recognized by clients as a differentiator, especially in the current market environment. Also, as Robin mentioned earlier, Wove is off to an excellent start.\nIn Treasury Services, investment services fees decreased by 2%, reflecting higher earnings credits for noninterest-bearing deposit balances and lower payment volumes, partially offset by continued momentum across payment and [indiscernible] solutions.\nIn Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 10% driven by U.S. government clearance volumes reflecting elevated volatility and U.S. treasury issuance following resolution of the debt ceiling. We also saw healthy growth in collateral management fees.\nAs the largest truly global collateral manager, we continue to increase market connectivity by expanding our tri-party platform to include new markets, trade types and collateral pools. Our average tri-party collateral management balances increased by 16% year-over-year to $6 trillion.\nTurning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $813 million, down 10% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 10%. Investment and other revenue was $12 million in the quarter primarily reflecting seed capital gains, and net interest revenue declined 37% year-over-year.\nAssets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 2% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this decrease largely reflects lower market values driven by the year-over-year decrease in U.K. fixed income markets and the Alcentra divestiture, partially offset by cumulative net inflows and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar.\nIn the quarter, we saw $9 billion of net outflows from long-term products as clients continue to derisk and rebalance their portfolios. And despite competitive investment performance, we saw $9 billion of net outflows from cash.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 9% year-over-year primarily reflecting the sale of Alcentra and the mix of cumulative net inflows, partially offset by improved [ fee capital ] results and lower money market fee waivers, while Wealth Management revenue decreased 10% driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix. Client assets of $286 billion increased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows.\nPage 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with a few comments on our current financial outlook for the second half of the year. Number one, our net interest revenue outlook for the full year '23 remains unchanged for 20% growth year-over-year. This is based on market-implied forward interest rates towards the end of the quarter.\nWe are pleased with our net interest revenue trajectory and balance sheet management year-to-date, but mindful that we are operating in a very uncertain environment with continued rate volatility and higher for longer rate market backdrop and uncertainty surrounding meaningful U.S. treasury issuance in the coming months.\nNumber two, we are ahead of plan when it comes to executing on our efficiency efforts. We remain focused on outperforming our target of 4% expense growth excluding notable items for the full year '23 and will work hard to drive this closer to 3% in the coming months. While we expect the operating environment to continue to weigh on fee growth relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year, our progress on the expense side continues to give us confidence in our ability to deliver positive operating leverage this year.\nNumber three, we still expect to return 100% of our earnings or more to our shareholders over the full year while continuing to position ourselves conservatively with respect to our capital levels, considering the amount of operating uncertainty.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to report that the company continues to perform well against the backdrop of complex operating environment. And we continue to execute with a great sense of urgency against our growth and efficiency initiatives.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A?",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. As always, we will reference our Financial Highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com.\nI'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks and Dermot will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the Earnings Press Release, Financial Supplement and Financial Highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 18, 2023, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nVice Chair & CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Marius, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Dermot to review our financial results, I want to provide some broader perspectives and an update on how we're serving our clients stepping up as a firm in this complex environment. Following a relatively benign start to the year, markets were quite unsettled in March, when we saw two prominent bank failures in the United States and a government broker distressed bank takeover in Europe.\nWhile things have calmed down somewhat over the past couple of weeks, after over a decade of zero interest rate monetary policies, the risks and uncertainty associated with the fights against inflation, higher interest rates and quantitative tightening, together with geopolitical tensions remain elevated. And domestically, we continue to march closer to another debt ceiling standoff. Against this backdrop, it's a healthy reminder that the strength of BNY Mellon's highly liquid lower credit risk and well-capitalized balance sheet, in combination with the resilience of our platforms is the bedrock that supports our client franchise.\nFor nearly 240 years, we've built up a legacy of client and industry trust rooted in our resiliency through good times and bad. We've been a port in the storm for our clients in periods of stress over that time and recent weeks have been no different as we've helped our clients to navigate the volatility in markets with our strong balance sheet and broader liquidity solutions.\nAfter seeing deposit balances increase following recent market events, we ended the quarter slightly higher than where we started it. And our broader liquidity platform, which manages over $1.3 trillion worth of cash and other short-term investment options on behalf of our clients has seen growth across most channels. But more broadly, the recent events have led to concern around the health and stability of some banks as they've highlighted the critical importance of robust asset and liability management for all financial services participants as one of the largest banks in the United States and as a G-SIB, we are held and we hold ourselves to a high standard, including stringent capital, liquidity and stress testing requirements.\nOn capital, unrealized losses related to our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio are already reflected in our capital ratios. We have consistently maintained the majority of our investment securities portfolio as available for sale. And as you will recall, we've had a view for a while now that rates would be a little higher in their terminal rate than the market has been pricing in. And so over the last 1.5 years, we meaningfully reduced the duration and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of the portfolio. Together, these actions provide us with ample flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions as we move through the year.\nAnd on liquidity, our robust liquidity management framework includes risk metrics such as concentration limits and daily liquidity stress testing protocols that go beyond regulatory requirements. It is these periods of stress that also showcase our characteristic resilience and the power of our diversified and lower-risk business model.\nWe primarily serve large institutional clients who collectively maintain substantial deposit balances with us as part of the services we provide to support their business activities, whether that's custody, cash management, clearing and corporate trust services. As a result, roughly 2/3 of our deposit base is operational and sticky in nature and derived from a diverse set of business lines.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we manage over $1 trillion of cash on behalf of our clients across deposits, money market funds, repos and securities lending, which allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various short-term investment alternatives. And we're also the largest provider of collateral services globally. Our average tri-party balances increased to $5.6 trillion this quarter, which is another example of just how comprehensive our role is in the broader liquidity ecosystem.\nNow turning to our financial performance in the quarter. As you can see on page 2 of our Financial Highlights presentation, we delivered solid results. We reported earnings per share of $1.12, up 30% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items, primarily in the first quarter of last year. Revenue was up 11% year-over-year. We closely managed expenses, up 3% year-over-year, and we generated a healthy return on tangible common equity of 20%. And given how in focus capital and liquidity are at the moment, I'll note that our Tier 1 leverage ratio as well as our liquidity coverage ratio remains strong and unchanged compared to the prior quarter, well above regulatory requirements and our own management buffers.\nStepping back for a moment, I'm encouraged by the early progress that we are seeing around the company to deliver on the commitments that we made to you back in January. First, we are bending the cost curve. Our first quarter expense growth came in marginally better than our initial internal plan and we remain firmly committed to cutting our core expense growth by roughly half this year compared to 2022 on a constant currency basis.\nSecond, in line with our outlook for the year, we continued to derive healthy growth in net interest revenue.\nThird, we delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.\nAnd fourth, we returned a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders, including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases.\nWe've made good initial progress on our plan to return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders in 2023, and we currently expect to continue buying back stock, albeit at a slower pace given the uncertain environment. At the same time, I've made a promise to you to call it as it is when we fall short of our expectations. And so to be candid, our fees being flat year-over-year was somewhat lackluster.\nHaving said that, there were a number of business highlights this quarter that are designed to help us change this trajectory and drive underlying fee growth over time. And so I'll call out a few.\nIn Asset Servicing, the pipeline remains strong, and the margin on new deals is improving as we're increasingly holding the line on price to drive more profitable growth in the business.\nETF activity is up across all measures with healthy increases in AUC/A, orders and flows. And wins with Alts and in our Data Platform Service business were pleasing to see this quarter. In January, we announced the launch of our Outsourced Trading business powered by a platform that already executes more than $1 trillion in volumes annually for our Investment Management business.\nThis global multi-asset trading service can help clients to reduce their costs and focus on alpha generation. While still early days, we think there is significant opportunity here to offer front office trading capabilities in a trusted, unconflicted way to the market.\nPershing brought in a healthy $37 billion of net new assets during the quarter, representing mid-single-digit organic growth on an annualized basis and total revenue was a quarterly record. As part of BNY Mellon, clients recognize Pershing as a source of strength and stability in the marketplace. In the current environment, clients also appreciate the flexibility and choice of our product offering.\nMeanwhile, our Pershing X team continues to make great progress as we aim for a broader rollout this summer. Just last week, we announced a collaboration with Snowflake to provide our prospective Pershing X clients with more powerful analytics and faster data management, improving their digital experience so they can operate more efficiently.\nClearance and Collateral Management activity remained elevated, given the volatility in the market and as dealers increasingly finance larger inventories via tri-party. We continue to see growth from the investments that we've made to increase market connectivity by expanding our tri-party platform into new markets across Asia and EMEA, and into new trade types and collateral pools, reinforcing our role as the only truly global provider of collateral management.\nTreasury Services delivered broad-based client wins across U.S. dollar, digital and FX payments, Liquidity and Trade Finance products and also saw a nice pickup in account and operational deposit growth towards the end of the quarter.\nInvestment and Wealth Management, although our investment performance remained solid, AUM flows were mixed with strength in fixed income and LDI strategies partly offset by outflows in other long-term strategies. During the quarter, our U.K. investment manager, Newton, launched 5 FutureLegacy funds, its first range of risk-rated sustainable multi-asset funds to support growth in the U.K. retirement market. And back in the U.S., the Dreyfus BOLD share class, which we introduced last year, has now raised over $4 billion in AUM.\nIn summary, over the past few months, I've spoken about our combination of client trust at scale platforms, client-focused culture and resilience as a powerful foundation on which we can build. I'm also proud that our culture has been front and center in recent weeks as our people have risen to the occasion, responding commercially and working tirelessly to enable successful outcomes for our clients in these uncertain times.\nI view this client-first culture as the key to make more out of our diversified portfolio of adjacent businesses. While we are the world's largest custodian and a trust bank, the contributions from Clearance and Collateral Management, Pershing, Treasury Services and Issuer Services are differentiating in our client value proposition. With that, let me officially welcome Dermot to his first earnings call. Dermot, over to you.\n\nDermot William McDonogh\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Robin, for the introduction, and good morning, everyone. It's a privilege to be here, and I look forward to working with you all. I'll start on page 3 of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the first quarter.\nTotal revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. This reflects fee revenue being flat as headwinds from lower market value, a stronger dollar and the sale of Alcentra, which closed in November last year, were offset by significant improvement in fee waivers and the absence of a notable item last year related to Russia.\nFirm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $46.6 trillion increased by 2% year-over-year. Growth from new and existing clients more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market values and currency translation, a real testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise.\nQuarter-over-quarter, assets under custody and/or administration increased by 5%. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 16% year-over-year. Here, the impact of lower market values and the stronger dollar was tempered by cumulative net inflows over the 12 months. Quarter-over-quarter, assets under management increased by 4%. Investment and other revenue was $79 million, and included another strong quarter of fixed income trading on the back of elevated volatility and greater demand for U.S. treasuries. And net interest revenue increased by 62% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher interest rates.\nExpenses were up 3%, driven by higher investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings and the impact of the sale of Alcentra. The impact of inflation and merit increases were largely offset by the favorable impact of the stronger dollar. And the provision for credit losses was $27 million in the quarter, reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast.\nAs Robin mentioned earlier, earnings per share were $1.12, up 30% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable items, largely in the first quarter of last year. Our reported pretax margin was 28% and our return on tangible common equity was 20%, the highest in 3 years.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which continues to be our binding capital constraint, was 5.8%, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and our CET1 ratio was 11%. The strength of our balance sheet and our healthy earnings generation in the quarter allowed us to return $1.6 billion of capital to our common shareholders, including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases while maintaining our capital ratios well above regulatory minimums and above our more stringent management target.\nSimilarly, on liquidity, our liquidity coverage ratio was 118% and also unchanged compared with the prior quarter. The strength of our highly liquid, lower credit risk and well-capitalized balance sheet is one of the cornerstones of our franchise. Starting in late '21 and throughout '22, we proactively reduced the duration and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of our investment securities portfolio, while consistently keeping over 60% of the book available for sale to position ourselves with ample flexibility for changing market and interest rate conditions.\nBetween the beginning of this year and early March, we saw deposit balances decline in line with typical seasonal patterns and in line with our expectations, considering continued Central Bank tightening by both rate hikes and quantitative tightening. This was followed by a swift increase in deposit balances as clients sought the strength of our balance sheet during the recent turmoil in the banking sector. We ended the quarter with deposit balances up 1% sequentially on a period-end basis, but we expect continued moderation of deposit levels in the months ahead.\nNow moving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% quarter-over-quarter. This sequential increase reflects higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs and the impact of balance sheet size and mix. While this is clearly a very volatile quarter in rates markets, it is worth noting that, on average, realized rates were in line with our projections for the quarter. Our outperformance compared to our prior expectations was primarily driven by slightly lower-than-expected deposit betas.\nOn a quarterly average basis, deposit balances decreased by 3% sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 26% of total deposit balances, which continues to be above our long-term range of 20% to 25% based on historical averages in normal interest rate environments.\nAverage interest-earning assets decreased by 1% quarter-over-quarter. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo was flat, loan balances were down 6%, and our investment securities portfolio was flat.\nMoving on to expenses on page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.1 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As mentioned earlier, this reflects investments in higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings and the impact of the sale of Alcentra. The impact of inflation and merit increases was largely offset by the favorable impact of the stronger dollar.\nRobin has been clear about our determination to bend the cost curve. We're executing with discipline and urgency, as you can see signs of our delivery in our professional, legal and other purchase services, net occupancy and business development lines. We feel good about our progress in the first quarter and how it positions us for efficiency savings in the coming quarters to help us meet our goal for the year.\nTurning to our business segments. Let's start with Securities Services on page 7. As I discussed the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement.\nSecurities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 4%. Within this, FX revenue was down 6% as the benefit of higher volatility was more than offset by a decline in emerging market volumes and net interest revenue was up 77%. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees decreased by 5%. The benefit of lower money market fee waivers and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values, lower client activity and the stronger dollar.\nIn Issuer Services, investment services fees increased by 67%. This increase largely reflects the absence of the notable item last year related to Russia as well as lower money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on page 8. Markets and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 10% and net interest revenue increased by 53%.\nIn Pershing, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily driven by the abatement of money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower client activity. Net new assets were a healthy $37 billion in the quarter, and average active clearing accounts were up 6% year-on-year.\nIn Treasury Services, Investment Services fees decreased slightly by 1% driven by higher earnings credit on noninterest-bearing deposit balances on the back of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers and net new business. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, Investment Services fees were up 7%, largely reflecting higher used government clearance volumes amid continued demand for U.S. Treasuries.\nMoving on to Investment and Wealth Management on page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $827 million, down 14% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 15%. Investment and other revenue was $6 million in the quarter primarily reflecting seed capital gains as opposed to losses in the first quarter of last year, and net interest revenue was down 21% year-over-year. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 16% year-over-year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this decrease largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar, partially offset by cumulative net inflows. In the quarter, we saw $5 billion of net inflows into long-term products. We continued to see healthy net inflows into our LDI strategies of $10 billion, and we also saw $4 billion of net inflows into our fixed income strategies.\nIn cash, where we expected outflows from a small number of clients, this was offset by healthy inflows on the back of our continued strong investment performance.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 15% year-over-year. This decrease reflects the impact of the sale of Alcentra, the mix of cumulative net inflows, lower market values and the stronger dollar and was partially offset by lower money market fee waivers.\nIn Wealth Management, revenue was down 12%, driven by lower market values and changes in product mix. Client assets of $279 billion was down 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segments.\nI'll close with a few comments on how we're currently thinking about our financial outlook for the year, which in short remains basically unchanged. From our earnings call in January, you will recall that based on market implied forward interest rates at the end of last year, we projected an approximately 20% year-over-year increase in net interest revenue for the full year '23. As you all know, we continue to see significant volatility in rates, markets and market implied forward interest rates currently suggest some meaningful Fed easing relative to the dot plots. We have positioned ourselves for continued interest rate volatility and retain ample flexibility and liquidity to respond to a wide range of outcomes as the ultimate impact of continued tightening remains uncertain.\nWe're off to a good start in the first quarter. And based on market implied forward interest rates at the end of March, we still believe our outlook for 20% year-over-year growth in net interest revenue is realistic with some skew to the upside.\nWe also still expect expenses, excluding notable items to be up 4% year-over-year, assuming foreign exchange rates at the end of last year or by approximately 4.5% on a constant currency basis. As we said on our earnings call in January, we are determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this year. We still expect an effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range and finally, as we calibrate the amount and pace of our continuing share repurchases in the weeks and months ahead, we will be mindful of the continued uncertainty in the operating environment, especially as it relates to the uncertain path of interest rates and so we're planning to maintain our current more conservative capital buffers for the time being.\nSo to wrap up, we're pleased with the company's solid financial performance in the first quarter which amid a challenging operating environment once again showcased the strength and resilience of our business model.\nAs we look forward, we are continuing to manage our balance sheet conservatively and we are confident that we are well positioned to help our clients navigate the elevated uncertainty in global markets. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the conference over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of IR, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks and Emily will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 13, 2023, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nBefore Emily takes you through our quarterly results, I'd like to make a few broader comments on our performance in 2022 and on some areas of focus for 2023. As you can see on Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we reported earnings per share for the full year of $2.90, down 30% compared to the prior year, and a return on tangible common equity of 13%. Excluding the impact of notable items, we reported earnings per share of $4.59, which was up 8% year-over-year and a return on tangible common equity of 21%, reflecting our solid underlying performance against the backdrop of a complex operating environment in 2022.\nOur results this year included several notable items. For example, those related to Russia in the first quarter and the goodwill impairment related to investment management in the third quarter. And our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of a number of decisions that we made to improve our revenue growth and efficiency trajectory moving forward.\nExcluding notable items, revenues grew a little faster than expenses as we continued to see strength in client activity and volumes while continuously positioning ourselves to derive meaningful benefit from the upward move in interest rates. Together, these factors more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market levels.\nOn the back of organic growth in AUC/A, we're continuing our role as the world's largest custodian, and we saw cumulative net inflows in assets under management. Beyond the numbers, I'd like to highlight a couple of areas where I'm particularly encouraged by our performance in 2022. First, our sales momentum, which speaks to the strength of our client franchise and our capabilities. In Asset Servicing, we continue to elevate our client dialogue while maintaining a strong focus on service quality to support our clients through a difficult environment.\nSales wins increased off a strong 2021, and we're winning larger and higher-value deals, which is where the elevation of client dialogue matters. In ETFs, AUC/A reached $1.4 trillion as we saw strong net inflows throughout the year, and the total number of funds serviced rose by 12%. And in Alts, we grew AUC/A by 14%, and fund launches were up by over 25%. Treasury Services delivered strong broad-based growth throughout 2022. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Conduent to be their trusted payments infrastructure provider as they launch a digital integrated payments hub for businesses and the public sector.\nThis hub will enable access to more secure, faster and cost-effective options to send, request and receive payments and refunds in a matter of minutes using Real-Time Payments and other proven payment technologies.\nAnd we also onboarded several new clients during the quarter as we continued to build our digital payments and related FX businesses. And finally, while 2022 was no doubt a difficult environment for the wealth market, our Wealth Management business acquired more clients, with particular strength in the ultra-high net worth and family office segments, and we continue to deepen existing relationships through our expanded banking offering where the percentage of advisory clients who also bank with us rose by about 5 percentage points.\nNotwithstanding the tough backdrop, Pershing, which is, in fact, our largest play as a company in the wealth space, brought in net new assets of over $120 billion, representing 5% growth. In the fourth quarter, we announced 2 very exciting wins, demonstrating the broad-based capabilities that Pershing is uniquely positioned to offer. The first was State Farm, which is an exciting relationship given State Farm’s size and reach with its thousands of agents across the country serving tens of millions of households. And we also onboarded Arta Finance which was founded by a team of former Google executives who are now leading a global digital family office that uses advanced technologies to empower investors with tools to invest intelligently. This win is an important proof point of our proven set of APIs and digital capabilities and demonstrates our ability to win with tech-forward clients.\nThe second area of performance, I'll call out is that we continue to forge ahead with our longer-term growth initiatives such as Pershing X, Real-Time Payments, the reimagining of custody and collateral, and digital assets. These initiatives will help position the company for the next leg of growth beyond the medium term. We went live with our Digital Asset Custody platform in the U.S. in October. And as I highlighted in my op-ed in the Financial Times a month ago, this will continue to be a focus for us, not so much for crypto, but really the broader opportunity that exists across digital assets and distributed ledger technology. If anything, the recent events in the crypto market only further highlight the need for trusted regulated providers in the digital asset space.\nWe are also now live with our first release of Pershing X, just 1 year after launching the initiative. This release to a small number of select clients includes 3 core products: Portfolio Solutions, including direct indexing; Client Servicing; and Data and Reporting tools. But equally importantly, this release is about our ability to set a goal on a tight timeline and execute.\nFinally, the third and probably most important highlight of the year for me is our people and our systems, once again, demonstrated remarkable resilience. Across the war in Ukraine, the extraordinary moves we saw in several government debt markets and volume surges, the operational readiness of our people and our systems consistently enabled successful outcomes for our clients. I cannot thank our people enough for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients.\nWhile we're proud of these accomplishments, it's also important to humbly recognize an area where we fell short this past year. Acknowledging the inflationary headwinds, expense growth for a second straight year was around 5% ex notables. We consider that number too high, especially considering the expense growth benefited from a stronger U.S. dollar throughout the year. On a constant currency basis, expense growth ex notables was approximately 8%.\nWhile I'm encouraged by the renewed sense of urgency across the organization over the last few months to better manage our expenses, we still have a ways to go on this journey, which brings me to our key focus areas for 2023.\nFirst, Expenses. My leadership team and I are fully committed to bending the cost curve this year. That will come from instilling further expense discipline across the firm and from focusing more on profitable new business growth, saying no to more things when the economics aren't what they should be.\nEfficiencies are also going to come from implementing ideas that will make BNY Mellon a simpler, more efficient place to do business with. And so here, we've embarked on an enterprise-wide initiative, led by senior leaders and high-performing employees from around the world, focused on driving greater efficiency and enabling sustainable growth. No one knows the ins and outs of our products, services and processes better than our people. And so all of our staff have had the opportunity to take an active role in this initiative by submitting ideas for how we can run the company in a better way for all our stakeholders.\nTo date, we've approved about 1,500 high-quality ideas, of which about 200 are already completed and another 500 are on track to be implemented this year with a meaningful amount of these ideas requiring little upfront investment. Emily will cover this in more detail, but as a result of these initiatives and our renewed determination, we expect to achieve nearly double the amount of efficiency savings this year compared to what we achieved in any of the recent years.\nBut our priorities are, of course, not just about managing expenses. We are also focused on reinvigorating profitable growth. Our budget commits to achieving positive underlying growth this year across almost all of our businesses, with particularly healthy growth coming from Asset Servicing, Pershing and Treasury Services. We will continue full speed ahead with our critical long-term growth investments that I mentioned earlier with clear and specific targets that we expect the teams to hit over the course of the year.\nLastly, on the top line, our priorities include goals for our 1BNY Mellon program, which incentivizes cross-business referrals and development of innovative, multi-business solutions that only BNY Mellon's unique collection of businesses is equipped to provide. In 2022, we saw good initial momentum, and we surpassed our initial goal for the year, and we intend to deliver a further pickup in 2023 as we increasingly sell our platform and better connect the dots for our clients.\nFinally, on capital management, I'll highlight that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which provides us ample flexibility and having ended the year comfortably above our capital management targets, we're now resuming buybacks. And so in summary, while none of us can predict exactly what the operating environment will look like in 2023, we are laser focused on growing the franchise and executing against our efficiency plans with discipline and urgency to drive some positive operating leverage in 2023 while returning a healthy amount of capital to our shareholders this year.\nWith that, let me turn it over one last time to Emily as our CFO.\n\nEmily Hope Portney\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone.\nAs I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Starting on Page 3 of our financial highlights presentation. Total revenue of $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter was down 2% on a reported basis and up 9% excluding notable items. As Robin mentioned earlier, and as you can see at the bottom of the page, our reported results in the fourth quarter included a few notable items resulting from actions to improve our revenue and expense trajectory. Reported revenues included approximately $450 million of net securities losses recorded in investments and other revenue, resulting from a previously disclosed repositioning of our securities portfolio, which I will expand upon later.\nFee revenue was flat as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and healthy organic growth across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment was offset by the impact of lower market values from both equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Firm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $44.3 trillion declined by 5%. The headwind of lower market values and currency translation was tempered by continued growth from both new and existing clients. And assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased by 25%. This also reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. And again, this headwind was partially offset by cumulative net inflows.\nInvestment and other revenue was negative $360 million in the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding notable items, investment and other revenue was a positive $100 million, a good results, reflecting another quarter of strong fixed income trading performance. And net interest revenue increased by 56%, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. Expenses were up 8% or 2% excluding notable items. Notable items amounted to approximately $200 million in the quarter, primarily severance expenses. And provision for credit losses was $20 million, primarily reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast.\nOn a reported basis, EPS was $0.62, pretax margin was 17% and return on tangible common equity was 12%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.30, up 25% year-over-year. Pretax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 24%.\nTouching on the full year on Page 4. Total revenue grew by 3% on a reported basis and by 6%, excluding notable items. Fee revenue was flat. Investment and other revenue was negative $82 million or positive $340 million, excluding notable items. And net interest revenue was up 34%. Expenses were up 13% on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding notable items, consistent with our goal to drive 2022 expense growth towards the bottom half in the 5% to 5.5% range that we guided to throughout the year. Excluding the benefit from the stronger U.S. dollar, expenses ex-notables for the year were up 8%.\nProvision for credit losses was $39 million compared to a provision benefit of approximately $230 million in the prior year. On a reported basis, EPS was $2.90, pretax margin was 20% and return on tangible common equity was 13%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $4.59, up 8% year-over-year. Pretax margin was 29% and return on tangible common equity was 21%.\nOn to Capital and Liquidity on Page 5. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8%, up approximately 35 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings, the sale of Alcentra and an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned through dividends. Our CET1 ratio was 11.2%, up approximately 120 basis points, driven by the increase in capital and lower risk-weighted assets. And finally, our LCR was 118%, up 2 percentage points sequentially.\nTurning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 6, which I will also talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was up 14% sequentially. This increase primarily reflects higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs. Once again, NIR in the quarter exceeded our expectations as noninterest-bearing deposits remain elevated. Average deposit balances decreased by 2%. Within this, interest-bearing deposits increased by 2% and noninterest-bearing deposits declined by 11%.\nDespite this decline in the quarter, the share of noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits has held up better than expected at 27%, which is higher than historical averages, and we continue to actively manage our deposit footprint to optimize across NIR, liquidity value and returns on capital.\nAverage interest-earning assets remained flat. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo increased by 4%. Loan balances were down 1% and our investment securities portfolio was down 3%. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we took actions to reposition the securities portfolio to improve our NIR trajectory for the coming years. We sold roughly $3 billion of longer-dated lower yielding municipal and corporate bonds, which we've been replacing with significantly higher yielding securities earning roughly 5% or 250 to 300 basis points more than what we were earning on the securities that we sold.\nWhile we realized an approximately $450 million pretax loss with this sale, this transaction was virtually capital neutral because the unrealized loss was already recognized in AOCI. In fact, we freed up roughly $150 million of CET1 capital as the higher credit quality replacement portfolio consumes significantly lower RWA.\nMoving on to expenses on Page 7. Expenses for the quarter were $3.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 2% year-over-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency savings, higher revenue-related expenses, including distribution expenses as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar.\nTurning to Page 8 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 18% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 2% and net interest revenue was up 79%, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower balances. As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement.\nIn Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 1% as the impact of lower market values and a stronger U.S. dollar were mostly offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers, higher client activity and net new business. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 7%, driven by the reduction of money market fee waivers and higher Depositary Receipts issuance and cancellation fees.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 9. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 19%. Fee revenue was up 14% and net interest revenue increased by 33%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 22%. This increase reflects lower money market fee waivers, higher fees on sweep balances and higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year and lower market levels. Net new assets were $42 billion, reflecting a very healthy level of growth from existing clients, while flows related to dividends and year-end capital gain distributions were naturally more muted than in the prior year quarter. And average active clearing accounts were up 4% year-on-year.\nIn Treasury Services, investment services fees were flat. The benefit of lower money market fee waivers and net new business was offset by the negative impact to fees from higher earnings credits on the back of higher interest rates. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, Investment Services fees were up 6% primarily reflecting higher U.S. government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for U.S. Treasury securities due to elevated volatility amid evolving monetary policy.\nNow turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 10. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $825 million, down 19%. Fee revenue was down 18% and net interest revenue was up 2%. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion declined by 25% year-over-year. This decrease largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar partially offset by cumulative net inflows.\nAs it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $6 billion of net outflows from long-term products and $27 billion of net inflows into cash. Among our long-term active strategies, liability-driven investments continued to be a bright spot with $19 billion of net inflows in the quarter, a real testament to our market-leading capabilities and resilient performance during the recent market dislocation. The very healthy net inflows into our cash strategies come on the back of strong investment performance, most notably in our Dreyfus money market funds.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 22% due to lower market values, and mix of cumulative net inflows, a stronger U.S. dollar, and the sale of Alcentra, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. And finally, in Wealth Management, revenue was down 12%, primarily reflecting lower market values. Client assets of $269 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values.\nPage 11 shows the results of the Other segment, where investment and other revenue includes the net loss from repositioning the securities portfolio and expenses include severance.\nNow let me close with a few comments on how we're thinking about 2023. With regards to NIR, we have positioned ourselves for another year of healthy growth. And so we currently project an approximately 20% year-over-year increase for the full year, and that assumes current market-implied interest rates. Having said that, the range of potential outcomes remains relatively wide, and the quarterly trajectory of NIR will be dependent on various factors, including the path of deposit levels and mix as well as interest rates. As it relates to fees, as you know, market-driven factors like equity and fixed income market levels, currency and interest rates dominated fee dynamics in 2022 while underlying growth across Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services was offset by headwinds in Investment and Wealth Management. For 2023, we expect to return to some underlying fee growth for the firm.\nNow Robin talked about the work we've been doing over the last few months to bend the cost curve while making sure we're continuing to invest. For 2023, this translates into expenses, excluding notable items increasing by approximately 4%, assuming exchange rates remain flat to where they ended 2022, or by approximately 4.5% on a constant currency basis. This compares to 8% in 2022. And then on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the 21% to 22% range, primarily due to an increase of the corporation tax rate in the U.K. this year.\nAnd finally, I want to close with a few remarks on capital management. As you saw, we ended 2022 comfortably above our management targets. And our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which provides us ample flexibility. As always, the timing and the amount of repurchases is subject to various factors, including our capital position and prevailing market conditions, among others. Based on our current expectation for continued earnings growth in combination with our estimated trajectory of AOCI pulling to par, we're now resuming buybacks and would expect to return north of 100% of earnings through dividends and buybacks in 2023.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyright material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of IR, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com.\nI'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Robin will make introductory remarks, and Emily will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2022, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Having formally taken over as CEO a little over a month ago, it is a tremendous honor to usher in a new chapter for this great institution. After spending a significant portion of the past few months, engaging with clients, regulators, employees and other business leaders, I'm excited about our exceptional client franchise, our central role in global financial markets and the opportunity that lies ahead.\nNow as a new CEO and considering the current environment, and it being the time of year when budgets and strategic plans are helpfully debated and brought together, naturally I'm using this opportunity to take a particularly close look at our priorities.\nWhile I'm still reviewing everything, it's apparent to me that while we've made good progress in a number of areas over the last couple of years, there are also clearly opportunities to further enhance BNY Mellon's performance for our clients and shareholders alike.\nFirst, I see exciting growth opportunities and numerous examples of innovation like Pershing X, the reimagining of our collateral and custody platforms, digital assets and real-time payments that we need to continue to invest in and execute on with great discipline and urgency.\nSecond, we're not just reviewing the top line, we are also closely examining our cost base and margins. I'm questioning how we do things, and I'm of the view that our margins should be better in some areas.\nFor example, we talked to you about improving our pretax margin in Securities Services to 30% over the medium term. More broadly, we are also going to be looking for efficiency opportunities as we drive our operating model transformation, and will be very determined to see them through.\nAnd third, while we have been providing more holistic solutions to clients that we believe our unique collection of businesses is better placed to deliver, we have the potential to do a lot more. I touched on this on the last earnings call, but I continue to believe that the opportunity to deliver the whole firm through a more unified One BNY Mellon is meaningful. As we continue to work through and bottom out all of these opportunities in the coming months, we will be regularly providing you with progress updates along the way.\nMoving on to the quarter. I'll start with some broader perspectives before I run through a few financial highlights, and then I'll turn it over to Emily to review our financial results in more detail.\nAs you are aware, during the quarter, we continue to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets; persistently high inflation, driving increased expectations for significant rapid rate increases by central banks in developed countries; a strengthening U.S. dollar; and a complex geopolitical landscape.\nWe also began to see some government intervention; for example, Japan stepping into the FX market to manage their currency. And this was particularly on display in the U.K. wherein the last few weeks, there has been extraordinary volatility in the gilt market as a result of the U.K. government's spending and taxation plans. This led to a series of actions by the Bank of England, including delaying their QT plans, announcing a gilt purchase program and a liquidity facility aimed to stabilize the market. Our business model as a core provider touching so much of the financial system gives us a terrific vantage point on what's going on in markets.\nFor example, our data shows that building up throughout the quarter and heading into quarter end, the market was extremely short euros to levels not seen in quite a few years. And we've seen international holders selling U.S. treasuries.\nAnd more broadly, it's clear that market liquidity continues to be challenged in some markets more so than in others. As we sit here today, most markets have continued to function in a relatively orderly fashion, trades are settling and fails and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels. But clearly, risks are elevated and the system feels more fragile than it was a few months ago.\nWhile the environment is quite uncertain, our platform of trust and innovation is very much in demand by our clients. As their cost pressures rise, we are seeing a lot of interest in engaging with us to review operating models. The scale of our platforms should allow us to lower operating costs for our clients, enabling them to focus on their core strengths.\nTurning to our performance in the quarter and referring to Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation. We reported EPS of $0.39 on $4.3 billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of 7%. These results were impacted by a goodwill impairment charge that Emily will discuss in more detail shortly. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.21, up 11% year-over-year, and our return on tangible common equity was 22%.\nRevenue grew 6% year-over-year, a testament to the diversity and resiliency of our business model. This performance reflected the benefit of higher interest rates as well as continued strength in client volumes and balances across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments.\nWhile investment in Wealth Management was naturally more affected by the continued decline in global market values, particularly in Investment Management, the business delivered positive net inflows in the quarter and continued to deliver solid investment performance for our clients.\nTouching on a few business highlights. Asset Servicing continued to deliver solid top line results, and our sales momentum remains strong, with wins and mandates up from a strong 2021 and yet to be installed AUC/A meaningfully higher than last quarter.\nIn ETFs, we continue to see strong net inflows and the total number of funds serviced is up almost 10% from the beginning of the year. We're also seeing strong momentum and traction in the alts space and have an active pipeline across credit, private equity and real estate.\nAnd we were pleased to announce that Aviva Investors, a large European-based global asset manager, recently appointed us to provide a fully integrated operating model for certain front office support services as well as middle and back office activities, allowing them to focus on delivering an exceptional client experience powered in no small part by the scale and capabilities of our platform.\nAnd finally, following the formation of our digital assets unit in 2021, we are now live with our Digital Asset Custody platform in the U.S.\nTo this point, we continue to see significant institutional demand for resilient, scalable financial infrastructure built to accommodate both traditional and digital assets. And we see Digital Asset Custody as an important foundational capability for the future of financial markets as blockchain technology allows for tokenization of all kinds of assets and currencies.\nBut just to be clear, we did not invest in this space just for the purpose of custodying crypto. We see this as the beginning of a much broader journey.\nPershing had a solid and resilient quarter, benefiting from its diverse revenue mix that includes not only market-based fees but also transaction fees, balanced base fees, subscription fees and net interest revenue with many of these income streams playing well in the current environment.\nWe also gathered a strong $45 billion of net new assets in the quarter, and the pipeline remains healthy, boding well for flows in the months ahead.\nPershing X reached another milestone through an equity investment and partnership with Conquest Planning, a fintech, which uses AI and powerful analytics tools to help advisers improve their efficiency and create highly customizable financial plans for their clients. X's Minimum Viable Product remains on track to launch in the fourth quarter. Our client engagement, together with the product design input which that brings, is helping us to accelerate and enhance the delivery of an exciting end-to-end digital experience for advisers.\nClearance and Collateral Management delivered strong growth on the back of higher U.S. clearance volumes, as market volatility continues to drive secondary trading activity in U.S. treasuries. In fact, in September, settlement volumes were the highest they've been since March of 2020. We also saw growth in margin-related services, reflecting the industry-leading work that the team is doing to help our clients comply with uncleared margin rules in derivatives trading.\nTreasury Services achieved a number of wins this quarter as we continue to bring innovative new solutions to the market. We were awarded a contract for white-labeled trade processing for a major U.S. bank. We sponsored our first supply chain financing program for a major investment-grade corporate client, and we were awarded and will be managing payroll and digital asset transfers for a major digital asset client.\nRecognizing our momentum in this business, The Banker named us 2022 Global Transaction Bank of the Year. We're also proud to have been recognized by them with additional awards for our work to transform the real-time and digital payment space and optimize trade finance payments by leveraging emerging technologies.\nLet me conclude with a note of humility about the uncertainty that we're all witnessing in markets these days. None of us can predict the exact path of markets and the economic conditions from here, and the level of uncertainty is greater than many have become used to.\nAs a firm, we are positioning ourselves conservatively in this environment and recognize that the strength and stability of our platform is important for the uninterrupted functioning of a significant part of global capital markets. We're proud of this role and the service that we deliver to our clients around the world.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Emily for the more detailed review of our financial performance in the quarter.\n\nEmily Hope Portney\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.\nStarting on Page 3. Total revenues increased by 6% to $4.3 billion in the third quarter. Fee revenue was down 1% as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and organic growth across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments was offset by the impact of lower market values across equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.\nFirm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $42.2 trillion decreased by 7%. The impact of lower market values and currency headwinds was tempered by continued growth from new and existing clients. And assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased by 23%, also reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by cumulative net inflows.\nInvestment and other revenue was $117 million in the quarter. This included a $37 million gain on the sale of our HedgeMark subsidiary. Through a minority equity stake in the combined company, we will continue participating in their growth and our clients will certainly benefit from a robust suite of managed account solutions.\nNet interest revenue increased by 44%, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. Reported expenses were up 26%. This included a $680 million impairment of goodwill associated with our Investment Management reporting unit, which was driven by lower market values and a higher discount rate. While having impacted our earnings for the quarter, this impairment represented a noncash charge and did not affect the firm's liquidity position, tangible common equity or regulatory capital ratios.\nExcluding notable items, expenses were up 4%. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $30 million, primarily reflecting reserve releases related to cash balances and exposure to Russia as well as a modest benefit from our commercial real estate portfolio.\nOur effective tax rate was 38.4% or 19.5%, excluding notable items. Reported EPS was $0.39, pretax margin was 15% and return on tangible common equity was 7%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.21, pretax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 22%.\nNow on to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4%, up 19 basis points sequentially, reflecting the benefit of lower average assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in Tier 1 capital.\nThe sharp increase in interest rates, especially in the last weeks of the quarter, resulted in an increase of the unrealized loss on our available-for-sale securities portfolio of approximately $900 million after tax during the quarter. And we distributed approximately $300 million of earnings to our shareholders through common stock dividends. As I mentioned earlier, the goodwill impairment did not affect our regulatory capital ratio. Our CET1 ratio was flat sequentially at 10%. And finally, our LCR was 116%, up 5 percentage points sequentially.\nTurning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I'll also talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $926 million was up 12% sequentially. This increase primarily reflects higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expense. Average deposit balances decreased 7%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar contributed approximately 1 percentage point to this decline.\nOverall, this is largely consistent with our previously expressed expectation for the trajectory of deposit balances through the remainder of the year amid continuously rising interest rates as well as typical seasonal declines in deposit balances in the third quarter, while noninterest-bearing deposit balances continue to hold up better than we had previously expected.\nAverage interest-earning assets decreased by 5%. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo declined by 10%; loan balances decreased by 1%; and our securities portfolio balances were down 2%.\nMoving on to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.7 billion on a reported basis. Excluding notable items, expenses of $3 billion were down 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-over-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency saves; higher revenue-related expenses, including higher distribution expenses related to the abatement of fee waivers; as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar. A few additional details regarding noteworthy year-over-year expense variances. Distribution and servicing expense was up 16%, driven by higher distribution costs associated with money market funds.\nBusiness development expenses increased as travel and entertainment expense continued to normalize off a low base last year. And lastly, the change in other expenses reflects litigation expenses in the prior year.\nTurning to Page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was up 1% and net interest revenue increased by 54%, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nAs I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, I will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement.\nIn Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 3% as growth from abating money market fee waivers, higher client activity and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nWe continue seeing healthy organic growth from both new and existing clients and our sales momentum continues, with wins year-to-date up meaningfully compared to an already strong 2021.\nIn Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 2%, primarily reflecting the reduction of money market fee waivers, partially offset by previously disclosed lost business in Corporate Trust in the prior year and lower fees from Depository Receipts programs for Russian issuers.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 11% and net interest revenue was up 34%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nIn Pershing, investment services fees were up 16%. The positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity was partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business in the second half of last year and lower market level.\nNet new assets were $45 billion in the quarter. On an annualized basis, this translates into a 9% growth rate, highlighting a strong quarter of inflows for both new and existing clients especially in this current environment.\nAn average active clearing accounts increased by 3% year-on-year. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 3%, driven by lower money market fee waivers, new business and slightly higher payment volumes, partially offset by higher earnings credits for our clients on the back of higher interest rates. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 5%, primarily reflecting higher U.S. government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for U.S. treasury securities due to elevated volatility amid a rapidly evolving monetary policy backdrop.\nNow turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $862 million, down 16%. Fee revenue was also down 16% and net interest revenue was up 21%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances.\nAs I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased 23% year-on-year. The decrease primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar as about 40% of our AUM are denominated in foreign currencies, partially offset by cumulative net inflows. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $23 billion of net inflows into long-term products and $2 billion of net outflows from cash.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 20%, primarily reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar as well as changes in the AUM mix, partially offset by lower fee waivers.\nRobin mentioned the extraordinary volatility in the U.K. government bond market earlier. This has caused some significant challenges for U.K. pension scheme over the past few weeks.\nAs a manager of liability-driven investment strategies, Insight has been working closely with our clients to maintain the appropriate hedging levels in their portfolios. And I'd like to note that as an agent between our LDI clients and their market counterparties, we have no balance sheet exposure.\nIn Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% as the decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market values was partially offset by higher net interest revenue, reflecting higher interest rates.\nClient assets of $256 billion were down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment.\nAs always, I'd like to close with a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of the year as we see it today, acknowledging the heightened uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment and continued market volatility. Based on current market-implied interest rates, we now expect net interest revenue for the full year to be up approximately 30% compared to 2021 as we expect another quarter of sequential NIR growth.\nGiven the continued decline in equity and fixed income markets as well as the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect fee revenue for the full year to be down slightly compared to 2021, assuming equity and fixed income values as well as currency stay at the levels where they ended the third quarter.\nWe continue to expect expenses, excluding notable items for the full year to be within the range of up 5% to 5.5% that we had guided you throughout the year. That being said, we are intensely focused on disciplined expense management and are working hard to drive this towards the bottom half of that range, and we still expect an effective tax rate between 19.5% and 20% in the fourth quarter.\nAnd finally, I'll note that we continue to manage to a Tier 1 leverage ratio target of 5.5% as well as a CET1 ratio target of 10%. As we think about the right timing for a resumption of buybacks in the coming months, we will continue to be prudent and consider capital levels, the expected trajectory of deposit balances at AOCI as well as the economic outlook at that time.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of IR, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As always, we will reference our financial highlights presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com.\nI'm joined by Todd Gibbons, our Chief Executive Officer; Robin Vince, President and CEO-elect; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, Robin will lead the call and make introductory remarks, followed by Emily, who will then take you through the earnings presentation. Following their prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 15, 2022, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Robin.\n\nRobin Antony Vince\n\nPresident, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we talk about our results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and recognize that today is Todd's last earnings call.\nTodd, on behalf of all of us here at BNY Mellon, I'd like to thank you for your leadership and for your many years of service to the firm and our clients. For nearly 4 decades, you made a tremendous impact on BNY Mellon and its evolution from the rather traditional commercial bank that we once were to the globally significant financial services firm, sitting at the heart of the financial ecosystem, that we are today.\nWhen the Board asked you to take the helm at a very challenging time amid a worldwide pandemic, you not only navigated the firm through this unprecedented environment with a steady hand, but you also continued to drive our client and growth agenda forward. On a more personal note, I want to thank you for working so closely with me during this transition. I know it was always important to you to ensure a seamless transition before you retire, and I couldn't have had a better partner on this journey.\nHaving spent a meaningful part of the last 4 months meeting and listening to our employees, clients and many other stakeholders, I'm even more optimistic about the next chapter for BNY Mellon.\nAt the very heart of our firm lies an exceptional client franchise. Our clients truly view us as a trusted partner, and a resounding message that I have heard is that our clients want to do more with us. We have a growth opportunity by making that easier for them. We have to do a better job connecting the dots both internally and externally, and we will.\nAnd while our investments over the last couple of years have paid off in the form of the remarkably resilient platform that we have today, I'm also of the view that the efficiency opportunity available in driving our operating model transformation has more runway. I look forward to formally taking on my new role at the end of August and will continue to share my views on our strategy and plans over the coming months.\nMoving on to the quarter. I'll start with some broader perspectives before I run through a few financial highlights, and then I'll turn it over to Emily to review our results for the quarter in more detail.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets, persistently high inflation, rapidly evolving monetary policy around the world, and all this against an increasingly complicated geopolitical landscape. You've all seen those charts. The S&P 500 had its worst first half performance in over 50 years. 10-year treasuries had the worst start to the year since the beginning of the index in the early '70s. And with 150 basis points in rate hikes, this is the fastest tightening cycle over 6 months since the Volcker era at the end of the '70s.\nUnderneath these headlines, what we're seeing across our platforms is that investors are clearly rebalancing and derisking. We're seeing asset reallocation from growth to value, higher-than-expected cash balances and relatively shallow market liquidity, making it harder for investors to move risk. That said, in our role as a critical infrastructure provider touching so much of the core financial system, we do see today that markets continue to function in an orderly fashion, trades are settling and fails and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels.\nTurning to our performance in the quarter and referring to Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation. We reported EPS of $1.03 on $4.3 billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.15 and return on tangible common equity was 21%.\nOur second quarter results reflect the benefit of higher interest rates, the strength of our diversified platform and our unwavering commitment to our clients. Those clients clearly value our resilience, the quality of our services and insights and the trusted relationship that they have with BNY Mellon. While lower market values adversely impacted asset-based fees, elevated volatility, wider spreads and higher transaction activity across new and existing clients hampered the impact.\nAsset Servicing continued to see healthy client volumes and our sales momentum and pipelines continue to be strong. Wins and mandates are up year-on-year, and that's broad-based across products and geographies, producing a strong pipeline of AUC/A to be installed over time. And our retention rates continue to be exceptionally high, north of 90%.\nIn our ETF servicing business, total funds serviced are up 5% year-to-date, enabling ETF AUC/A to hold steady despite the impact from lower market values. And in alts, wins year-to-date have already exceeded all of 2021. It's also worth noting that more than 20% of our multiproduct deals have a data and analytics component as our D&A capabilities become more meaningful to our overall Asset Servicing deal pipeline.\nIn our Markets franchise, FX revenue was up nicely year-over-year and the business continued its steady climb in the Euromoney FX survey, landing at #8 overall this year, our highest ranking ever, up from #13 a year ago and #32 in 2018, while also maintaining its top 3 real money ranking.\nIssuer Services, and in particular Depository Receipts, had a solid quarter on the back of growth in dividend annuity fees and cancellation activity.\nIn Pershing, year-over-year revenue was also up, and we're seeing encouraging signs in terms of sales momentum. We continued to gather net new assets this quarter, albeit at a slightly slower pace given the market backdrop. But the pipeline for the second half and beyond remains strong as we continue to grow the core business and see renewed client interest in digital wealth solutions as well as the advisory tools we will offer through our Pershing X initiative.\nIn a great One BNY Mellon example, this quarter, Pershing and Asset Servicing combined their capabilities to roll out what is essentially a self-directed vehicle for a large government agency, offering choice of roughly 5,000 funds to a total addressable population of about 6 million eligible participants for the benefit of their retirement plans.\nLast month, Pershing hosted its INSITE conference with 1,600 business leaders, industry advocates and next-generation talent. This conference is a flagship event for Pershing and we were pleased to announce some next-generation tech solutions for advisors and wealth management professionals with the introduction of the latest generation of our Pershing platform and enhancements to our API suite.\nTurning to Clearance and Collateral Management. The business delivered another strong quarter of growth on the back of higher securities clearance volumes, where market volatility continues to drive activity levels in U.S. treasuries. And we also saw average collateral management balances reached another record of $5.2 trillion in the quarter, driven by money market fund demand for the RRP facility.\nTreasury Services also delivered solid growth, driven by higher rates and higher payment volumes as well as broad-based growth across multiple products: Core U.S. dollar wire, debit card processing and immediate payments from both new and existing clients.\nOur Investment Management business was significantly impacted by lower market values, the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and clients derisking amid an increasingly uncertain environment. Having said that, our investment performance remained strong with over 70% of our top 30 strategies by revenue in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year basis. Insight was ranked first by Greenwich Associates for overall quality in LDI for the 12th year in a row and was ranked first for fixed income overall quality with U.K. consultants.\nAnd BOLD, which is the new cash management fund share class launched to help investors make a positive direct social impact, raised another $2 billion in the quarter, bringing total AUM to over $3 billion in just 4 months.\nAs most of you saw, we also announced the sale of Alcentra to Franklin Templeton at the end of May. This transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, builds upon our strategic relationship with Franklin Templeton as we will continue to offer our Alcentra's capabilities in BNY Mellon's sub-advised funds and in select regions via our global distribution platform. We will also provide Alcentra with ongoing Asset Servicing support.\nAt closing, we expect that this sale will increase the firm's CET1 capital by about $0.5 billion and it will free up seed capital to help accelerate our strategy of developing new, differentiated solutions from our specialist investment firms that meet the evolving needs of our clients.\nAnd finally, Wealth Management continued to execute against its 3-pronged strategy: Acquiring more client relationships in the ultra high net worth family office segments, deepening banking relationships and investing in technology and driving efficiency. As we engage with our clients in this space, we continue to lead with some of the most innovative digital capabilities in the industry.\nFor a second consecutive year, the Financial Times named BNY Mellon the Best Private Bank for Digital Wealth Planning, North America, recognizing our Wealth Online client portal and our proprietary goals-based planning tool advice path. And the Family Wealth Report recognized our Active Wealth Accelerator as the best customer-facing digital platform.\nTurning to capital. Despite the significant headwind from rapidly rising interest rates, we remain well capitalized with healthy capital buffers to support our clients with a strong balance sheet in this volatile market environment. The recently announced results of the Fed's 2022 stress test demonstrated once again that BNY Mellon has one of the most resilient business models and balance sheets in the industry. And our preliminary stress capital buffer, as calculated in the test, remains at the Fed's 2.5% floor.\nAnd so as expected, earlier this morning, we announced that our Board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.37 per share in the third quarter.\nNow before I turn it over to Emily, I'd be remiss not to also touch on our announcement last week that Dermot McDonogh will join us in November and become our next CFO, effective February 1, 2023. I've known Dermot for over 20 years and I'm really looking forward to his addition to our team. And I'm also pleased for Emily, who, after helping Dermot transition into the CFO role, will take on leadership of several of our key growth areas, namely Treasury Services, Credit Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, reporting directly to me.\nBut in the meantime, I certainly like reminding Emily that she still has a few more earnings calls to go. And so with that, over to you, Emily.\n\nEmily Hope Portney\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.\nTurning on Page 3. Total revenue for the second quarter of $4.3 billion grew by 7%. Fee revenue was up 4%. This increase primarily reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers as well as continued underlying momentum across Security Services and Market and Wealth Services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values across both equity and fixed income markets.\nMoney market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $66 million in the quarter, an improvement of $133 million compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher average short-term interest rates.\nFirm-wide AUC/A of $43 trillion decreased by 4% as continued growth from new and existing clients was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and currency headwinds. AUM of $1.9 trillion decreased by 17%, reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.\nInvestment and other revenue was $91 million, reflecting a quarter with strong trading performance as well as the benefit of a strategic equity investment gain which was partially offset by seed capital losses.\nAnd net interest revenue increased by 28%, primarily reflecting higher rates and a change in asset mix.\nExpenses were up 12%, including the impact of higher litigation reserves, a notable item this quarter. Excluding notable items, expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter, as expected, which translates to an increase of 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth includes, among other items, the impact of pulling forward our annual merit increase to the second quarter from the third quarter.\nProvision for credit losses was $47 million versus the provision benefit of $86 million in the second quarter of last year, and they primarily reflect changes in the macroeconomic forecast.\nOur effective tax rate was 21.1%. The notable item increased our effective tax rate for the quarter by approximately 150 basis points.\nReported EPS was $1.03, pretax margin was 26% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.15, pretax margin was 28% and return on tangible common equity was 21%.\nNow on to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.2%, down 10 basis points sequentially. The continued sharp rise in interest rates in the quarter resulted in an approximately $900 million after-tax unrealized loss on our available-for-sale securities portfolio. And we distributed 33% of earnings to our shareholders through approximately $280 million in common stock dividends. Our CET1 ratio was 10%, down slightly versus the prior quarter. And finally, our LCR was 111%, up 2 percentage points sequentially.\nTurning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue was $824 million, up 18% sequentially. This increase was driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expense. Average deposit balances and average interest-earning assets both declined by 1% sequentially. Loan balances grew by 3% sequentially, primarily driven by collateralized loans in wealth management and growth in capital call finance and trade finance. Our securities portfolio balances were down 3%.\nMoving on to expenses on Page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.1 billion on a reported basis and $3 billion excluding the impact of higher litigation reserves. Excluding notable items, expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter, as expected, and up 8% year-on-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency savings, the pull-forward of our merit program as well as higher revenue-related expenses. The benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar was largely offset by persistently higher inflation.\nA few additional details regarding noteworthy year-over-year expense variances. Staff expense was up 7%, driven by investments and the annual employee merit increase, which in the prior year, was effective in the third quarter. Distribution and servicing expense was up 23%, reflecting higher distribution costs associated with money market funds. Business development expense was up, reflecting some normalization of travel and entertainment off a low base from last year. And lastly, the change in other expense was largely driven by the increase in the litigation reserves.\nTurning to Page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2 billion, up 12% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 8% and net interest revenue was up 29%, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nAs I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, I will focus comments on the investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement.\nIn Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 4%. This increase reflects lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values. Asset Servicing continued to deliver healthy organic growth from both existing and new clients, and our pipeline continued to grow across client segments and with particular strength in EMEA.\nIn Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 10%, reflecting higher Depositary Receipts revenue and lower money market fee waivers, partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed lost business in the prior year in Corporate Trust.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.3 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was up 9%, and net interest revenue was up 18%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nIn Pershing, investment services fees were up 9%. The positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and higher transaction activity was partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year, as previously disclosed. Net new assets were $16 billion in the quarter.\nIn Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 10%, reflecting the benefit of lower money market fee waivers as well as higher payment volumes on the back of growth from both new and existing clients.\nAnd in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 5%, primarily reflecting higher U.S. clearance volumes amid elevated market volatility and continued geopolitical uncertainty, all driving strong demand for U.S. treasury securities.\nNow turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $899 million, down 10%. Fee revenue was down 9%. Investment and other revenue was a negative $13 million, which included seed capital losses as opposed to gains in the prior year. And net interest revenue was up 32%, reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher deposit balances.\nAs mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with assets under management of $1.9 trillion, down 17% year-over-year. This decrease primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar as approximately 45% of our AUM are denominated in foreign currencies. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $14 billion of net inflows into long-term products and $26 billion of net outflows from cash. LDI continued to be a bright spot among our active strategies with $12 billion of net inflows. And our index strategies gathered $12 billion of net inflows as well.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 14%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, lower seed capital results and lower market values, partially offset by the benefit of lower fee waivers. Further to Robin's comments on our positive investment performance, just this past weekend, Barron's recognized our Dynamic Value Fund and Income Stock Fund as 2 top performing active funds based on year-to-date results as well as longer-term track record.\nWealth Management revenue was down 1% as growth from higher net interest revenue resulting from higher interest rates and healthy deposit growth was offset by a decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market values. The business has continued to increase the number of clients who use our banking services, which is now at 60%, up significantly from a couple of years ago. And client assets of $264 billion were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values.\nPage 10 shows the results of the Other segment.\nI will close with a few comments on our outlook for the second half of the year. As we all know, the intersection of significant market volatility, rapidly evolving monetary policy from central banks around the world, continued geopolitical tension and increasing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment has made forecasting difficult.\nBased on current market-implied interest rates for the second half of the year, we now expect the percentage growth in net interest revenue for the full year to be in the low 20s compared to the prior year. This improved outlook continues to assume modest deposit runoff in the second half of the year, and it also assumes slightly lower deposit betas than previously expected, which has been informed by our repricing experience to date.\nSince we last provided you our fee revenue outlook for the year on our first quarter earnings call, both equity and fixed income market values have declined further and the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen significantly against most major currencies. Assuming equity and fixed income values as well as currencies stay at the level where they ended the second quarter, we would project fee revenue for the full year to be flat to slightly up year-over-year.\nAs it relates to expenses, ex notable items for the year, we continue to manage towards a year-over-year increase in the 5% to 5.5% range. Continuously strong inflationary headwinds are expected to largely offset the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Revenue-related expenses are increasing as fee waivers abate and we're onboarding our strong sales pipeline. And we continue to invest in the targeted growth and efficiency initiatives that we've highlighted before.\nDue to the impact of the notable item in the second quarter, we now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be closer to 19.5%. Taken together with our 16.7% tax rate in the first quarter, our expectation for a 19.5% to 20% tax rate in the second half of this year remains unchanged.\nAnd last but not least, we continue to be cautious on buybacks in this volatile environment. Although, based on current projections, we expect to end the third quarter at or above our internal capital ratio target.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now hand the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of IR, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. I'm joined by Todd Gibbons, our Chief Executive Officer; Robin Vince, President and CEO elect; and Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer. Todd will provide introductory remarks, and then Emily will take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplements and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 18, 2022, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Todd.\n\nThomas P. Gibbons\n\nCEO & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Referring to Slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation. We continue to see healthy underlying momentum across most of our businesses and reported revenue of $3.9 billion, which was roughly flat year-over-year, and it was up 2% if you exclude the impact of government sanctions and the additional actions that were taken related to Russia.\nNow we're in an increasingly uncertain environment, including the war in Ukraine, volatile markets and persistently higher inflation, which will require more meaningful monetary policy adjustments. It is in times like these that our strong, lower risk balance sheet and the resiliency of our business model differentiates us.\nIn the face of the tragic events occurring in Ukraine, we ceased new banking business in Russia and suspended investment management purchases of Russian securities. Since the beginning of the war, we stepped up our humanitarian efforts as well as the support for our employees and the members of our community who have been impacted. And we continue working for our multinational clients that depend on our custody and record-keeping services to manage their exposures.\nExpenses of $3 billion were up 5.5% as we continue to invest in further growth and efficiency initiatives. And we reported EPS of $0.86, and that included an $0.08 impact related to Russia. We continue to generate a significant amount of capital and returning close to 60% of earnings to our shareholders, primarily through common dividends.\nThroughout the quarter, we took actions in the investment securities portfolio to temper the immediate impact to capital from higher interest rates. And we expect higher rates to be both a positive for fees and net interest revenue going forward. Emily will discuss the details for the quarter shortly, but let me briefly touch on a few business highlights.\nIn Asset Servicing, we managed to keep the strong sales momentum with which we entered the year. Wins and win rates improved off of what had been a healthy quarter a year ago. One in mandated AUCA is up meaningfully both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, producing a strong pipeline of AUCA to be installed in 2022 and beyond. And our retention rate was an exceptional 97%.\nOur ETF business continues to stand out, having increased the number of funds serviced by 4% since the beginning of the year. And we were recognized as best ETF custodian at the ETF Express European Awards last month. We also continued building momentum as a leader in digital assets, having been selected by Circle as primary custodian for the USD coin reserves. And late last week, we announced an exciting data and digital collaboration with Aon.\nTogether, we will focus on supporting the ESG needs of clients globally, leveraging our collective data and analytics capabilities and unique data sets to help clients make better, more informed investment strategy decisions by providing enhanced data sets, advanced analytics and actionable insights into ESG portfolio level exposures.\nIn Pershing, year-over-year comparisons continue to be impacted by the previously disclosed lost business in the second half of last year. And remember, the first quarter of last year was exceptionally strong on the back of elevated transaction activity. Now while there are puts and takes here that can impact the amount of organic growth in any given quarter, we remain extremely excited about Pershing's prospects.\nOur clients are doing well and as they capture new assets, we're growing with them. And we're well positioned to benefit from a number of secular growth trends, such as the rapid growth in number of break way advisers and digitally oriented wealth firms. Of course, consolidation in the sector can leave us on either side of any particular transaction. But over time, we find that our clients are typically the largest and most complex players in the industry are more often than not on the acquiring side.\nAnd in Pershing X, we continue to make solid progress since announcing the initiative back in October. Following on last quarter's acquisition of Optimal Asset Management, this quarter, we made several key hires, which completed the filling out of our leadership team. And we folded Albridge's wealth reporting and data aggregation tool under the Pershing X umbrella. This alignment strengthens Pershing X's data offering allows it to draw on Albridge engineers to accelerate development of the platform and provides clients with access to a broader suite of technology solutions.\nShifting to Clearance and Collateral Management. There, we delivered a strong quarter of organic growth on the back of higher securities clearance volumes and as collateral management balances remained elevated at a record $5 trillion in the quarter. Market volatility is driving dealer demand for U.S. treasuries and we're also seeing a promising pickup in new collateral balances related to our future of collateral initiatives with asset balances already being mobilized to the EMEA region and growing, providing our clients with optimization and funding benefits.\nTreasury Services also delivered another solid quarter of growth, driven by higher payment volumes and an improved product mix. The business continued to build on its recent track record of industry first. This quarter being the first bank to successfully connect to and send a message on the FedNow real-time payment system. And we're excited to welcome Jennifer Barker to the company as the new CEO of the business starting in May. Jennifer brings almost 2 decades of global client experience in the Treasury Services industry, and she is the perfect leader to build upon the business' recent success and innovative track record.\nIn Investment Management, given the environment, it's not surprising to see some challenges as clients and higher earning funds rebalance and derisk. That said, investment performance remained strong with over 80% of our top 30 strategies by revenue in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year basis. We're also seeing good traction with our expanding suite of passive and active ETFs.\nWe launched the BNY Mellon responsible Horizon's corporate bond ETF managed by Incyte and total ETF AUM grew by 8% quarter-over-quarter. I also want to highlight an exciting new share class for the Dreyfus government Cash Management fund called Bold. This share class, which provides investors the opportunity to make a direct social impact supporting Howard University and historically black college and university already grew to over $1 billion in AUM with the only weeks of launch at the end of February.\nWe also continue to be pleased with the healthy growth that we're seeing in Wealth Management, client acquisition rates continue trending in the right direction and our improved digital tools and expanded banking offerings are driving deeper client relationships as evidenced by the solid loan and deposit growth.\nAs an example, during the quarter, we successfully completed the initial rollout of Loan Path, our new digital platform for investment credit lines, which allows us to streamline our processes and significantly improve the client experience at the same time. Across the franchise, we're honored to have once again been recognized by Fortune for making both its world's most admired companies in 2022 as well as its Blockchain 50 list, which recognizes 50 companies around the world for deploying blockchain technology to speed up business processes, increased transparency and potentially save substantial costs for the industry. We're also proud to have been named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, which recognizes companies that score highest across 230 environment, social and governance indicators.\nNow before I turn it over to Emily, I'd also like to touch on my decision to retire as CEO on August 31 and the appointment of Robin as my successor. When I joined BNY Mellon 36 years ago, I was drawn by the company's rich history, its special culture and the important place it occupies in the global financial system. Over the last 4 decades, we have undergone an incredible transformation from the traditional commercial bank that we once were to the globally significant lower risk financial services company that we are today.\nAnd I'm particularly proud of what we've accomplished over the last couple of years. With a new leadership team in place, we launched a compelling agenda for growth and innovation under which we've already seen a meaningful pickup in organic growth. We've also really involved our culture. Today, we're much more performance-oriented and client-centric, we're more nimble in our decision-making and we're doing a lot better at connecting the dots across our differentiated businesses.\nWhen our strategic ambitions and the strength of our franchise was tested by the global pandemic, our people once again rose to the occasion. And not only delivered on our commitments to our clients, communities and shareholders, but we also continue to make significant progress in our journey to position the company for the future.\nIn Robin, we have found an outstanding leader to build on this agenda and to lead BNY Mellon into its exciting next chapter. Having known Robin as a client for almost a decade, I was thrilled to recruit them to the company in 2020 and to work directly with him the last 2 years. Since then, he has not only had a profound impact on the company through his leadership of Pershing, Treasury Services, Clearance and Collateral Management and our Markets businesses, but he has been a trusted strategic adviser to me and the rest of the executive management team. Rob and I are working closely together and with our executive committee to ensure a seamless transition in the next couple of months. With that, I'll turn it over to Emily.\n\nEmily Hope Portney\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd. And I'll add my congratulations, too, on your retirement, and I want to thank you for your leadership and mentoring over the years. So good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.\nStarting on Page 3. Total revenue was flat and included an approximately $90 million reduction related to Russia, a notable item this quarter. Fee revenue was down 3% or flat excluding the impact related to Russia. The benefit of higher market values as well as continued momentum across many of our businesses was offset by the impact of lost business in Pershing and Corporate Trust in the prior year, lower FX revenue of elevated levels in the first quarter of last year and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.\nWhile not on the page, firm-wide AUCA of $45.5 trillion increased by 9%, of which 8% is growth from new and existing clients and 1% is driven by the impact of higher market values, net of currency headwinds. AUM of $2.3 trillion increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting cumulative net inflows and higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.\nMoney market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense were $199 million in the quarter, an improvement of $44 million compared to the prior quarter. This reflects the benefit of higher average short-term interest rates, partially offset by higher money market fund balances. Once again, our growth in money market fund balances meaningfully outpaced the industry. Together, the impact of lower waivers and higher balances drove a sequential increase in pretax income of close to $60 million.\nOn a year-over-year basis, fee waivers had a de minimis impact to our fee revenue. Investment and other revenue was $70 million. And net interest revenue increased by 7%, reflecting higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, change in mix and lower funding expense. Expenses were up about 5.5% or 6% excluding notable eye. Provision for credit losses was $2 million. The benefit from the continued improvement in the credit portfolio, led by commercial real estate was more than offset by a $15 million reserve build on interest-bearing deposits with banks in Russia.\nAnd our effective tax rate was approximately 17%, as expected, due to the annual vesting of stock-based awards in the first quarter, which provided a seasonal benefit. EPS Was $0.86 and included an $0.08 negative impact of the notable items related to Russia. Pretax margin and ROTCE were 23% and 15%, respectively, on a reported basis; and 25% and 17%, excluding notable items.\nOnto capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which continues to be our binding constraint, was 5.3%, down 15 basis points sequentially. The sharp rise in interest rates resulted in a $1.5 billion impact to unrealized losses in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. And we distributed roughly 60% of our earnings to our shareholders, predominantly through dividends. The impact of the reduction of capital on our Tier 1 leverage ratio was partially offset by the benefit of a smaller balance sheet quarter-over-quarter.\nOur CET1 ratio was 10.1%, down approximately 100 basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the negative mark-to-market of the AFS portfolio as well as an approximately 30 basis point impact from the adoption of SA-CCR. Finally, our LCR was 109%, consistent with the prior quarter.\nTurning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 5, which I will talk about in sequential terms. Net interest revenue was $698 million, up 3% sequentially. This increase reflects higher rates as well as continued growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower cash and securities balances. Average deposit balances declined by 3%, while average interest-earning assets were down 2% sequentially. Within this, loan balances were up nicely, about 3% sequentially.\nMoving on to expenses on Page 6. Expense for the quarter were $3 billion, up about 5.5% year-over-year and up 6% excluding notable items from last year. This increase primarily reflects investments net of efficiency savings, and it also reflects higher revenue-related expenses, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.\nA few additional details regarding noteworthy quarter-over-quarter expense variances. Staff expense was up 4%, reflecting the annual vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees. Distribution and servicing expense is up 5%, reflecting higher distribution costs associated with money market funds. And net occupancy expense was down 8% as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio.\nTurning to Page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Security Services reported total revenue of $1.8 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the reduction related to Russia, revenue was up 4%. Fee revenue was down 5% and up 1% excluding the impact of Russia. And net interest revenue was up 6%, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.\nAs I discussed the lines of business within our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on the investment services fee for each business, which you can find in our financial supplement. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5% and primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by slightly lower transaction activity from existing clients. As Todd mentioned earlier, our sales momentum continues to be strong compared to the first quarter of last year.\nOur Issuer Services business was significantly impacted by the reduction related to Russia. Investment Services fees were down 43%. Specifically, we accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depository services of Russian companies, which is a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, investment services fees were down approximately 9%, and this primarily reflects lower depositary receipt fees and the impact of lost business in the prior year in Corporate Trust.\nNext, Market and Wealth Services on Page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.2 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was also flat. And net interest revenue was up 2%, reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 6%. This reflects the impact of lost business in the prior year as well as lower transaction activity versus a very active first quarter of last year, partially offset by the impact of higher market value.\nPershing continued to deliver solid underlying growth. Clearing accounts continued to grow at a 4% annualized growth rate, and we gathered net new assets of $18 billion in the quarter. In Treasury Services, Investment Services fees were up 4% as the business saw growth from both new and existing clients and continue to gain traction in higher-margin products such as digital payments. And in Clearance and Collateral management, investment services fees were up 8%, reflecting both higher tri-party collateral management balances as well as higher clearance volumes.\nNow turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $964 million, down 3%. Fee revenue was also down 3%. Investment in other revenue was a negative $8 million and included losses on seed capital. And net interest revenue was up 19%, reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher deposits and loan balances. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with assets under management of $2.3 trillion, up 2% year-over-year.\nThis increase primarily reflects the benefit of cumulative net inflows into both cash and long-term products as well as higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $1 billion of net outflows from long-term products and $11 billion of net outflows from cash. Having said that, LDI continued to be a bright spot with $17 billion of net inflows.\nIn Investment Management, revenue was down 6%. Higher market values were more than offset by lower capital results and lower equity income as well as the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, which is more impactful in investment management, given that approximately 50% of our revenue is earned in foreign currencies. Wealth Management revenue grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue and higher market value. Client assets of $305 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher markets and cumulative net inflows.\nAnd we continue to see healthy growth in both deposits and loans as we've expanded our banking offering and deepened our client relationships. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. I will close with an update on our outlook for the full year of 2022. Obviously, given the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, rapidly evolving global monetary policy and the continued overhang of the pandemic, the macroeconomic environment is very uncertain.\nFor our outlook, we assume a scenario where interest rates follow the forward curve and market values stay relatively flat to where they were at the end of the first quarter. With this in mind, we project full year NIR to be up roughly 13% compared to 2021. Embedded in this assumption, we expect the correlation between rates and deposit runoff to be consistent with what we have seen in the past.\nWe now expect fee revenue to be up 4% to 5%. This includes a tailwind of about 5% from the reduction of fee waivers, organic growth of 1% plus and a 1% to 2% headwind from the impact of Russia, market value, currency and other factors. For expenses, ex notable items, we now expect an increase of approximately 5%, slightly lower than our previous guidance.\nWith regards to Capital Management, we've taken a number of actions to reposition our portfolio to reduce the impact of higher rates and credit spreads. For example, we lowered duration in the AFS portfolio, reduced credit exposure and moved assets to HTM. These actions have reduced our AOCI rate sensitivity by about 25% going forward.\nHaving said that, we remain cautious on buybacks in the near term. And based on the environment we described earlier, we ultimately expect to return at least 75% of earnings to shareholders this year. We do continue to expect to return close to 100% of earnings to our shareholders over time. Last but not least, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%.\nWith that, operator, can you please open the line\nfor questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.\nI will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMarius Merz\n\nHead of IR, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com.\nTodd Gibbons, our Chief Executive Officer, will open with his remarks. Then, Emily Portney, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the earnings presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 18, 2022, and will not be updated.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Todd.\n\nThomas P. Gibbons\n\nCEO & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThanks, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Emily will review our fourth quarter results and spend some time on our 2022 outlook in a moment. But before that, I'd like to touch on a few financial performance highlights for the full year and talk about the progress the firm has made across a number of dimensions in 2021.\nLast year was, in many regards, remarkable for BNY Mellon, and I couldn't be prouder of the resilience, dedication and innovative mindset of our management team and our exceptional colleagues around the world.\nAs I reflected on the year, there were 3 broad themes that really stood out to me. One was our outstanding sales performance and improved organic growth. The second one was the number of new and innovative solutions that we are working on, in many cases have already brought to the market. And the third was our improved effectiveness in harnessing our unique One BNY Mellon culture and the capabilities that we have by delivering more comprehensive and differentiated solutions to our clients. Now I'll expand a little bit on each of these points in a moment.\nTogether with the supportive market backdrop in a benign credit environment, our meaningfully improved organic growth has allowed us to more than offset the stiff headwind that we had from lower interest rates and deliver a solid and improved financial performance in 2021.\nReferring to Slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we reported EPS of $4.14 for the full year of 2021, that's up 8% year-over-year.\nRevenue of $15.9 billion was up slightly year-over-year as 2-plus percent organic growth and the benefit of higher market levels offset lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers.\nFee revenue was up 4% year-over-year and about 9% excluding the impact of money market fee waivers.\nAnd expenses were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting our investments as well as the quality of revenue that we generated.\nOur pretax margin of 29% as well as our return on tangible common equity of 17% were roughly in line with the prior year.\nAnd we returned $5.7 billion of capital or 160% of earnings to our shareholders through common dividends and $4.6 billion of share repurchases.\nAs I said earlier, 2021 was marked by outstanding sales performance and a meaningful increase in organic growth. In fact, organic growth was the highest that we've seen in a number of years.\nIn Asset Servicing, wins were up almost 50% compared to 2020, which has produced a meaningful pipeline of AUC/A. Our average deal size was up as we won larger and more complex businesses. And just as importantly, our retention rates also continued to improve. We believe this success is a testament to our service quality, and it's also a reflection of our broader capabilities as well as our open architecture framework, which is resonating with our clients and is differentiating us in the marketplace.\nI'd also like to call out our ETF business, which has delivered substantial growth and gained market share. Our ETF AUC/A grew by roughly 30%, which outpaced the broader market, and that doesn't yet include our recent win of approximately $350 billion of BlackRock's iShares.\nIssuer Services delivered meaningful organic growth on the back of the resumption of depository receipt issuance and dividend activity following what had been a COVID-related slowdown in 2020, continued strong sales performance.\nPershing gathered record new assets of about $160 million and continue to grow active clearing accounts in the mid-single digits despite the headwind of deconverting a couple of large clients in the second half of the year. Growth has been notably broad-based across broker dealers and registered investment advisers. Clients have told us numerous times that our ability to bring broker-dealer and RIA solutions together as one is a real differentiator, and we continue to benefit from our uniquely unconflicted role in the marketplace as we don't compete with our clients.\nTreasury Services delivered strong organic growth in the back of payment volumes recovering to above pre-COVID levels. And we improved the average price per payment transaction by about 5% as we continue to shift the product mix towards higher, value-added channels.\nClearance and Collateral Management is now running at a record $5 trillion of collateral management balances. Balanced growth has benefited from our unique role as the primary clearer of U.S. government securities and we've also seen continued growth in international balances.\nOur markets business has offset the impact of lower volatility and tighter spreads compared to the prior year, with strong broad-based organic growth across FX and securities lending.\nInvestment Management saw the highest net inflows into long-term products since 2017, driven by our LDI and fixed income strategies, but also including strong net inflows into our responsible investment funds as well as strength in our initial suite of index ETFs. $70 billion of net inflows in cash products were the highest in over (inaudible). We optimized our money market fund lineup to provide a more competitive and scalable offering. And with our new CIO in place, we're thrilled to see strong flows and improving market share.\nAnd finally, our Wealth Management business acquired significantly more new clients in 2021 than in 2020. And I'm pleased to see how the team is executing against the strategic plan that we put in place a few years ago. We continue to gain further traction in the larger, faster-growing client segments, and our expanded banking offering, both on the lending as well as the deposit side, has driven a meaningful uptick in the percent of wealth percentage of wealth management clients who also bank with us.\nThe second theme I mentioned earlier was innovation. And in some cases, it's been outright disruption. This is probably the area that is most exciting for us. I cannot recall in my tenure at the company a year in which we launched or rolled out more innovative products and services than we did over the last 12 months. I'll call out just a few.\nDigital assets. While still early days and recognizing that the regulatory landscape in this space is still evolving, our investments in building an industry-first, integrated digital and traditional assets offering are clearly showing positive initial results following the launch of our digital assets unit at the beginning of last year. We solidified our leadership in servicing crypto funds with the announcement of our partnership with Grayscale Investments over the summer, we've contracted with almost half of the pending funds in the U.S. and service most of the crypto funds in Canada. As I said, it's still early days, but we're excited about the disruptive potential of tokenization as well as smart contracts and the associated opportunities both on the revenue as well as the efficiency side.\nIn terms of real-time payments, this is an area that we embraced early on, and we continue to lead with innovative solutions to drive the proliferation of real-time payments in the U.S. You may remember that we were the first bank to originate a payment on the clearing house's real-time payments network several years ago. In late last year, we were the first to launch our real-time bill pay solution from billers and their customers. We're pleased by the initial uptake. We've already onboarded additional clients and the long list of interest and prospects continues to grow. As you know, the market for trading services is large and it's growing, but it's still very fragmented and ripe for disruption. So we're excited about the market leadership coming out of our Treasury Services business. It really goes far beyond just real-time payments and include examples by being able to leverage the cloud for wire payments and having been the first bank to complete a trade finance (inaudible) in SOFR.\nThe third item is the Future of Collateral, it's the world's largest global collateral manager. We continue to lead the charge in driving towards global collateral mobility, an optimization by connecting distinct platforms, expanding the scope of eligible collateral and implementing new capabilities.\nFor example, last year, we introduced Chinese bonds as eligible collateral on a global tri-party platform and we were the first bank to add agency mortgage-backed securities as collateral on overnight cleared repo transactions.\nAnd another first, we started offering our clients the ability to accept [CLAR based] on their ESG criteria through our digital platform.\nAnd finally, I'd be remiss not to mention the launch of Pershing X, which we introduced last quarter. Pershing X will design and build innovative solutions for the advisory industry, including a leading end-to-end wealth advisory platform that will help firms and their advisers solve the challenge of managing multiple and disconnected technology and data sets. While certainly a multiyear project, the team has hit the ground running. In this past quarter, we acquired Optimal Asset Management, which is not only an important step in our build-out of Pershing X in that it will allow us to offer direct indexing capabilities to our advisory clients within Pershing, but it will also benefit our Investment Management business as well.\nThe third and last theme is what we call One BNY Mellon. Now I've always been proud of our collaborative culture here at BNY Mellon, and as you know, our broader portfolio of businesses differentiates us from our competitors. Over the years, we've emphasized the interconnectivity of these businesses and the meaningful operational synergies between many of them. But we can still do a better job at delivering the whole firm to our clients. And so last year, we conducted a thorough review of the opportunities and further enhanced our setup of cross-business collaboration.\nNow I've been highlighting some of the most notable cross-business client wins, such as (inaudible), Lockheed Martin and Oak Hill, on our earnings calls over the last couple of quarters. Our ability to seamlessly deliver a much broader set of capabilities from across our security services, our market and wealth services and investment and wealth management businesses is a unique value proposition for our clients and our intensified collaboration effort is already driving higher revenues.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last 12 months. And while we certainly have more work to do, I'm confident that the company is on the right path for sustainably higher organic growth.\nAs we look to 2022 and beyond, we expect double-digit earnings per share growth as we are determined to continue delivering consistent organic growth, which, together with the current expectation for higher rates, should enable us to generate positive operating leverage while at the same time continue investing in growth and efficiency of our businesses.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Emily.\n\nEmily Hope Portney\n\nCFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I would like to spend a moment highlighting our new financial disclosures.\nLast month, we announced that starting in the fourth quarter, (inaudible) investment services, which is our largest segments, are 2 new business segments. Security services, which includes asset servicing and issuer services; and Markets and Wealth Services, which includes Pershing, Treasury Servicing and Clearance and Collateral Management. Our third segment, Investment and Wealth Management remains unchanged.\nWe made this change to increase the visibility of some of our most differentiated businesses to better align our reporting with how we already manage the firm and to provide additional granularity for all of our stakeholders to better track our performance against our strategy.\nWith that, I will turn to Page 3 and our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter was up 4%. Fee revenue also grew by 4%, or 8% excluding the impact of fee waivers. This reflects the benefit of higher market values and continued healthy organic growth.\nWhile not on the page, (inaudible) AUC/A of $46.7 trillion increased by 14%, with roughly 60% of the increase driven by growth from new and existing business and 40% driven by higher market value.\nAnd the AUM of $2.4 trillion increased by 10%, reflecting higher market values and full year net income.\nMoney market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $243 million in the quarter, an increase of $10 million compared to the prior quarter, entirely driven by higher money market fund balances with no meaningful impact on pretax income.\nInvestment and other revenue was $107 million and included a roughly $40 million valuation gain on a strategic equity investment. Our investments continue to pay off strategically as well as in the form of higher valuation.\nNet interest revenue was flat.\nExpenses were up 1% or 6% excluding notable items.\nOur provision for credit losses was a benefit of $17 million, primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast.\nEPS was $1.01. This includes a $0.04 negative impact of litigation reserves (inaudible) expense as well as a $0.02 positive impact of the provision benefit.\nPretax margin was 27%.\nAnd our return on tangible common equity was 17%.\n(inaudible) the full year, which Todd summarized earlier, from Page 4.\nTotal revenue grew by 1%, reflecting higher fee revenue, partially offset by lower net interest revenue.\nFee revenue grew by 4% or 9% excluding the impact of fee waivers.\nInvestments and other revenue was $336 million, a strong year, with meaningful gains on our strategic equities portfolio.\nAnd net interest revenue was down 12%.\nExpenses were up 5%, both on a reported basis as well as excluding notable items. Excluding the (inaudible) notable items, nearly half of the increase was driven by higher net incremental investments and the remainder was roughly evenly split between revenue-related expenses and the unfavorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.\nProvision for credit losses was a benefit of $231 million.\nEPS was $4.14.\nOur pretax margin of 29% as well as our return on tangible common equity of 17% were roughly in line with the prior year.\n(inaudible) capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is our binding capital constraint, was 5.5%, down approximately 20 basis points, primarily driven by a return of $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter, including $1.2 billion of buybacks, partially offset by earnings.\nAnd we exit the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%, (inaudible) approximately 60 basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter.\nFinally, our LCR was 109%, slightly lower than in the prior quarter.\nTurning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 6, which I will talk about in sequential term.\nNet interest revenue was $677 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% sequentially. This increase is driven by the impact of higher short-term rates on floating rate securities in our investment portfolio, disciplined deposits and liability pricing and higher loan and security sales slightly lower than in the prior quarter.\nTurning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 6, which I will talk about in sequential terms.\nNet interest revenue was $677 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% sequentially. This increase was driven by the impact of higher short-term rates on floating rate securities in our investment portfolio, disciplined deposits and liability pricing and higher loan and securities balances in the interest earning asset mix.\nAverage deposit balances increased slightly by 1% sequentially. And while interest earning assets were roughly flat, average loans increased by about 6%, with growth primarily driven by margin loans, collateralized loans and wealth management and growth in capital cost financing.\nWe also deployed some additional cash in (inaudible) securities, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter increase of the overall average investment securities portfolio of 2%.\nMoving on to expenses on Page 7. Expenses for the quarter were $3 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 6%, just over half of which was driven by incremental investments net of efficiency savings and the remainder by higher revenue-related expenses, including higher staff expenses.\nA few additional details regarding noteworthy quarter-over-quarter expense variances. Staff expense was up 3%, driven by severance expense and incentive compensation. Net occupancy expense was up 11%, driven by expenses associated with exiting leased space as we continue to optimize our new estate footprint and some expenses related to return to the office. Business development expense increased, driven by higher marketing expenses as well as G&A. Other expenses was down on lower litigation reserves.\nOn to Page 8 for a closer look at our new business segment. Securities Services reported total revenue of $1.8 billion or up 5%.\nLet me just describe a little about what makes up this 5% increase. Fee revenue was up 6% and up 10% excluding the impact of fee waivers. Investment in other revenue benefited from a gain on a strategic equity investment. And net interest revenue was down 3%, driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances.\nAs I discuss the line of business within our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on the investment services fees, each you can find in our financial supplement.\nIn Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 10%. Excluding the impact of fee waivers, investment services fees were up 12%, primarily driven by higher activity from existing clients, higher market values and net new business.\nOur strong performance last year came on the back of already healthy sales in 2020, and we gained further sales momentum in 2021 as our continued investments in innovation are paying off.\nIn Issuer Services, investment services fees were down 3%. But excluding the impact of fee waivers, investment services fees were up 1%. Healthy growth in depository receipts was largely offset by the impact of the previously disclosed discontinued public sector mandate in corporate.\nFX revenue in our Security Services segment increased by 6% and solid volume growth from existing and new clients more than offset the impact of lower volatility.\nNext on to Market and Wealth Services on Page 9. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.2 billion, up 1%, primarily driven by higher net interest revenue and fees.\nFee revenue was up 1% and up 4% excluding the impact of fee waivers.\nNet interest revenue was up 2% on the back of higher loan balances, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nIn Pershing, investment services fees were down 2%. However, excluding the impact of fee waivers, investment services fees were up 3% and the impact of clients lost earlier in the year was more than offset by growth on the back of higher market values, client balances and activity from existing clients.\nThe business continued to see good underlying growth. Net new assets in the quarter were $69 billion and clearing house were up 5% year-over-year.\nIn Treasury Services, Investment Services fees were up 4%. Excluding the impact of fee waivers, the investment services fees were up 8%, primarily driven by higher payment volume.\nAnd in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 7%, reflecting broad-based growth on the back of higher triparty collateral management balances and clearance volumes, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nTurning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 10. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $1 billion, up 3%. Fee revenue was up 4% and 9% excluding the impact of fee waivers. Net interest revenue was up 2% on the back of higher loan balances, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nAsset under management grew to $2.4 trillion, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and full year net inflows into both long term, specifically LDI and fixed income and cash.\nFor the quarter, we saw $31 billion of net inflows into cash and $4 billion of outflows from long-term products.\nInvestment management revenue was down 1%. However, excluding the impact of fee waivers, revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by higher market value and full year net inflows, partially offset by lower seed capital gains and performance fees.\nWealth Management revenue grew by 13%, driven by higher market volumes, the absence of the loss on a business sale in the fourth quarter of the prior year and higher net interest revenue on the back of healthy loan growth as we continue to deepen client relationships into banking. Client assets continue to grow at a steady pace and were $321 billion, up 12% year-on-year.\nPage 11 shows the results of the other segment.\nI will close with our outlook for 2022 on Page 12. I'll start with a reminder that our outlook is based on a current forward curve.\nWith that in mind, we currently expect NIR to increase by approximately 10% in 2022, primarily driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by an expectation for lower deposit balances.\nOur expectation for continued organic growth and lower fee waivers result in total fee growth of approximately 7% on in 2022. More specifically, we expect roughly 4% up to 7% increase to be driven by the recovery of money market fee waivers based on current forward curve and assuming some runoff in money market fund balances from current levels. We expect roughly 2% to be driven by organic growth and approximately 1% by market-driven factors.\nAnd as a reminder, we generally expect a quarterly run rate of around $60 million for investments in other revenue. But as you know, this line can be lumpy due to seed capital gains to the strategic equity investments and other components.\nFor expenses, ex notable items, we expect an increase of approximately 5.5% year-over-year. Roughly 60% of the increase is expected to be driven by higher revenue-related expenses, which include higher distribution and servicing expenses associated with fee waivers and (inaudible) of inflationary pressures. The remainder is driven by investments, roughly half of which is just the annualization of incremental investment in the second half of last year.\nSpecific to the first quarter, I'd like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retiring eligible employees. As a result, we expect first quarter expenses, ex notables, to be up approximately 6% year-over-year.\nWith regards to capital management, we expect to return roughly 100% of earnings, subject to changes in AOCI and deposits balance.\nUnder the sake of completeness, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%.\nTo sum up, and as Todd alluded to earlier, we expect to generate positive operating leverage on the back of continued organic growth and higher rates translating into higher NIR and lower fee waivers while continuing to invest in the future growth and efficiency of our businesses.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.",

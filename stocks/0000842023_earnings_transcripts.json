Welcome to Bio-Techne's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a solid quarter that was in line with our expectations. The team's continued execution drove 3% organic revenue growth in a dynamic operating environment. Our performance was once again fueled by strength in the biopharma end markets, particularly among large pharma customers, which fueled robust demand for our automated proteomic analytical instrumentation and cell therapy solutions.\nOur fourth quarter kept off a fiscal year in which we delivered 5% organic revenue growth. We reinforced our leadership across key markets through a series of innovative product launches and we positioned the company for sustained future growth. As a reminder, approximately 80% of Bio-Techne's revenue is derived from consumables, including those used for our proprietary instrumentation and this provides a strong foundation for durable growth.\nThis resilient revenue mix, combined with the critical value our customers place in our portfolio of tools for research, manufacturing and precision diagnostics was reflected in our differentiated financial performance despite uncertainties many of our customers face throughout 2025.\nThis performance was once again achieved with a strong emphasis on profitability. The operational efficiencies, we continue to implement, contributed to an adjusted operating margin of 32% for the quarter. Our team remains focused on striking the right balance between investing for future growth and driving productivity across the organization. This disciplined approach enables us to maintain our industry-leading profitability while positioning Bio-Techne for long-term success.\nBefore we delve into the quarterly performance, I want to highlight the strategic portfolio action that reflects our long-term financial and operational priorities. Last night, we announced the divestiture of our Exosome Diagnostics business, including the ExoDx prostate test and our CLIA-certified clinical laboratory to Mdxhealth, a recognized leader in urology and specifically prostate cancer diagnostics.\nFollowing a thorough strategic assessment we concluded that a single high-performing CLIA test does not provide us the operational leverage needed to support our broader growth ambitions. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarters of fiscal 2026.\nImportantly, Bio-Techne will retain access to the proprietary Exosome-based technology used in a recently launched ESR1 mutation kit for breast cancer, the occurrence. We remain committed to leveraging this platform to expand our portfolio of exosome-based gene mutation kits further strengthening our position in precision diagnostics.\nOver the past 5 decades, Bio-Techne has built a market-leading portfolio of high-quality, high-margin, reagents, instruments and tools serving both to life sciences and the clinical diagnostic markets. The divestiture of Exosome Diagnostics represents a strategic repositioning of our portfolio and this enables us to redirect investments towards strengthening our core foundation and our growth verticals. This transaction also delivers an immediate uplift to our already sector-leading operating margin profile. Jim will provide additional detail on the financial implications of this deal later in the call.\nLet's now turn to our end markets, beginning with biopharma. Throughout fiscal 2025, we saw steady momentum in this segment, particularly among large pharmaceutical customers. However, decent commentary from the U.S. administration regarding potential pharmaceutical tariffs and the proposed implementation of the most favorite nation drug pricing model has introduced a degree of uncertainty across the pharma landscape.\nDespite those evolving dynamics, including shifting time lines, changing tariff structures and dynamic messaging regarding policy intent, demand for Bio-Techne's broad portfolio remains strong. Large pharmaceutical companies continue to rely on our high-quality reagents and productivity enhancing tools to advance their pipeline initiatives, underscoring the essential role our solutions play in the research, development and manufacturing workflows. The growth driven by a large pharmaceutical customer base continued to be a key driver in the quarter.\nHowever, this momentum was partially offset by more subdued performance from smaller biotech firms. These companies remain cautious with their spending and made a constrained funding environment. This strength is consistent with broader industry data, which indicates that biotech funding has declined more than 40% year-to-date compared to the 2024 levels. Despite these headwinds, our overall biopharma end market delivered high single-digit growth for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year.\nTurning to academia, a segment that continues to attract heightened attention across the life science tools industry. Revenue from our academic customers represents approximately 21% of our total business with U.S. institutions contributing roughly 12%. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the upcoming NIH budget, we conducted a comprehensive assessment to better understand our exposure to NIH-funded research, based on this evaluation, our new estimate is that less than 1/3 of our U.S. academic revenue is directly tied to NIH grants.\nIn other words, our total company exposure to an NIH funded research is likely in the low single digits range. that is notably below our prior estimate of 5% to 6%. In light of recent reports of NIH grant cancellations, we also examined publicly available databases to identify which research areas are most affected. Encouragingly, our analysis revealed that funding for programs that are aligned with Bio-Techne's core portfolio remains largely intact.\nAreas such as proteomics, immunohistochemistry and Spatial Biology, cell culture, cell therapy and immunology have experienced relatively limited disruption. This reinforces the durability of our academic exposure, which is concentrated in fields of ongoing scientific and clinical importance. As a result, our academic end markets declined low single digits in the fourth quarter and increased low single digits for the full fiscal year.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, performance was broadly consistent with expectations. The Americas delivered low single-digit growth. Europe expanded mid-single digits. In APAC, excluding China, grew low single digits as well. Noteworthy is that China delivered a positive surprise, increasing low double digits in the quarter has originally turned to growth ahead of anticipated tariff impacts.\nThis momentum was broad-based spending our portfolio of research and GMP reagents, analytical instrumentation and spatial biology solutions. Beyond the tariff-related activity, market signals suggest that China has stabilized and is well positioned for a gradual return to modest growth in the coming quarters.\nNow let's discuss the growth drivers in our Protein Sciences segment, where strong execution drove demand across a portfolio of proteomic analytical tools and cell therapy workflow solutions. And this enables 4% growth for the segment in the quarter.\nFiscal 2025 was marked by several key product launches that further strengthened our position in the market. These launches included the introduction of Leo, our next-generation simple western instrument, the introduction of PopVax, enabling the continued expansion of our GMP reagents portfolio and the introduction of AI-enabled designer proteins.\nFor full fiscal year 2025, our Protein Sciences segment increased revenues by 5%. The demand for cell therapy workflow solutions remains strong with over 550 customers relying on Bio-Techne's high-quality, consistent in highly bioactive GMP reagents to advance their preclinical and clinical programs.\nAs mentioned, we introduced our PopVax GMP cytokine product line in fiscal year 2025. OpEx delivered precise cytokine concentrations to cell therapy manufacturers and support closed system CAR-T and TCR-T manufacturing workflows. These innovative cytokine delivery systems carry a value proposition that enables Bio-Techne to take share in later stage and potentially commercial stage programs.\nOur GMP reagent portfolio grew 20% in Q4 and exceeded 30% growth for the full fiscal year. Sticking with our cell therapy growth pillar, I also like to take this opportunity to give an update on the manufacturer of the leading GRx bioreactors, Wilson Wolf. Bio-Techne currently owns 20% of Wilson Wolf and is on track to acquire the remaining 80% by the end of calendar 2027 or earlier, contingent upon milestone achievements. Despite the ongoing softness in biotech funding, Wilson Wolf grew over 20% for fiscal 2025, while maintaining EBITDA margins north of 70% for the year.\nNext, I'd like to highlight the continued strength for proteomic analytical instrument business. The productivity gains these platforms deliver combined with disciplined execution from our commercial teams drove high single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. Importantly, we saw mid-teens growth in instrument revenue, marking the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in instrument placements.\nTurning to our Simple Western portfolio. Demand for our next-generation high-throughput instrument at Leo was strong in the quarter. The growing installed base, a robust order funnel and a higher consumable pull-through compared to the legacy Simple Western systems, all point to a promising future for this platform. We're also seeing meaningful traction in expanding the use cases for the Simple Western technology. A recent example is a role of Simple Western place in supporting the FDA approval of Abeona Therapeutics cell-based gene therapy.\nOur platform was used for GMP lot release testing of both the vital factor and the cell therapy, underscoring its grown relevance as a QC tool in therapeutic development and manufacturing. This is a clear signal that our instrumentation is not only driving productivity in research workflows, but it's increasingly being adopted in a regulated environment an important validation of our strategy.\nI'd also like to highlight the continued strength we're seeing in our biologics business led by the Maurice platform. Maurice continues to gain share, driven by its ease of use, a producibility and strong data compliance, which are attributes that align closely with the needs of our pharma and bioprocessing customers. As a reminder, Maurice is spec-ed into pharmaceutical manufacturing lines as a QA/QC instrument and demand for bioprocessing instrumentation remains robust. This tailwind, combined with our commercial execution, has translated into consistent growth in both instrument placements and consumables pull-through.\nWrapping up a Protein Sciences segment, I'd like to turn to our core reagent and assay portfolio. Our research use-only consumables, including our industry-leading catalog of 6,000 proteins and 400,000 antibody types grew low single digits in the quarter. Importantly, despite ongoing concerns around NIH outlays and uncertainties surrounding the fiscal 2026 NIH budget reagent sales to our U.S. academic customers remained flat compared to the prior year period.\nAnother highlight is that we reinforced our leadership in RUO assays through a strategic distribution partnership with Spear Bio. Under this agreement, Bio-Techne will distribute Spear Bio's ultrasensitive immunoassays targeting key Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, including pTau-217, NFL and others. This collaboration builds on our earlier participation in Spear Bio's $45 million Series A funding round in 2024.\nLet's now turn to the growth pillars within Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment. Organic revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to order timing across all 3 businesses. For the full year, however, the segment delivered 6% organic revenue growth, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. special biology remains the area with the highest exposure to academic customers, and as such, has been more acutely impacted by the uncertainties surrounding NIH funding and a softer biotech funding environment.\nAdditionally, order timing for several LUNAPHORE COMET systems weighed on our performance with geopolitical headwinds delaying instrument placements in the Middle East. As a result, Spatial Biology declined mid-single digits in Q4, but grew mid-single digits for the full fiscal year, including nearly 50% growth for LUNAPHORE.\nIn summary, I'm incredibly proud of the consistent execution by the Bio-Techne team throughout fiscal year 2025, especially in the face of persistent macroeconomic challenges and policy-driven uncertainties. This past year showcased our innovation at scale with several high-impact product launches across both segments that position us well for future growth. Our portfolio remains tightly aligned with some of the most attractive and fastest-growing markets in life sciences and precision diagnostics. With a focused strategy and a world-class team, we are well equipped to capitalize on these opportunities and drive long-term value creation.\nNow with that, I'll pass the call over to Jim. Jim?\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThank you, Kim. I'll start with some additional details on our Q4 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the forward outlook. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.49 in the prior year with foreign exchange having a favorable $0.03 impact. GAAP EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.11 compared to a positive $0.25 in the prior year period. Q4 revenue was $317 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year on an organic basis and 4% reported.\nBy geography, North America increased low single digits year-over-year, driven primarily by our pharma customers. Europe increased mid-single digits, led by strength from our biopharma customers and steady growth in academia. China increased low double digits as demand improved in front of tariff uncertainties, while the rest of Asia increased low single digits.\nBy end market in Q4, biopharma increased high single digits, while academia decreased low single digits in the quarter. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 70.1% in the quarter compared to 71.1% last year, down year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable product mix.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q4 was 30.2% of revenue compared to 29.8% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q4 was 7.8% of revenue compared to 7.9% in the prior year. The overall stability in SG&A and R&D was driven primarily by the ongoing benefits of structural streamlining and diligent expense control, offset by the funding of strategic growth initiatives.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q4 was 32%, down 150 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of unfavorable product mix. We continue to execute cost containment measures and prioritize our growth initiatives to drive efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of maximizing operating leverage while we are in this uncertain market environment.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q4 was $1.4 million, flat with the prior year. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $346 million. Other adjusted net operating income was $5.2 million in the quarter, an increase of $4.7 million compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by the foreign exchange impact related to our overseas cash point arrangements as well as our share of Wilson Wolf net income.\nMoving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 21.5%, down 60 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $98.2 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $4.9 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $12.4 million in dividends and $100.1 million through stock buybacks. We finished the quarter with $155.8 million average diluted shares outstanding a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year.\nOur balance sheet finished Q4 in a strong position with $162.2 million in cash, and our total leverage remains well below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $226.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 6% compared to the prior year.\nOrganic revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, with foreign currency exchange having a favorable impact of 2%. The segment's organic growth was driven by strong performances in our cell therapy and protein analytical tools businesses, especially from large pharma customers. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.6%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of favorable volume leverage, cost management and ongoing structural alignment initiatives.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment. Q4 sales were $89.7 million with both reported and organic growth decreasing 1% compared to the same period last year. Growth in a surgeon, our ExoDx prostate cancer test and our diagnostic reagents business was offset by the impact of macro uncertainties on our spatial biology portfolio and the timing of projects from our companion diagnostics customers. For modeling purposes, total Exosome Diagnostics revenue was $25.9 million in fiscal 2025 with an unfavorable impact of 200 basis points on our corporate adjusted operating margin.\nAs Kim mentioned in his remarks, we reached a definitive agreement to divest the Exosome Diagnostics business to Mdxhealth, and the business will be classified as a business held for sale until the anticipated close of the transaction during the first quarter of our fiscal 2026.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment operating margin, which was 6% compared to the prior year's 12.5%. The decrease in margin was primarily due to unfavorable product mix. We expect this unfavorable product mix within this segment to start to reverse in Q1 of fiscal year '26 and we anticipate an immediate improvement in the diagnostics and Spatial Biology operating margin following the Exosome Diagnostics divestiture.\nIn summary, Q4 was in line with our expectations, and our teams continue to execute extremely well, especially considering the turbulent market conditions induced by biotech funding challenges as well as NIH funding and tariff uncertainties potentially impacting our customers. Prior to the emergence of NIH funding and tariff uncertainties, our business was on its way back towards double-digit organic growth. which we continue to view as a long-term growth rate of our business under normal market conditions.\nLooking ahead, predicting when these uncertainties will be resolved and when we might see more stabilized end markets remains challenging. We are hopeful that the ongoing House and Senate appropriations process will bring greater clarity to the government's fiscal 2026 NIH budget. Encouragingly, select members of Congress continue to express support for NIH funding, though the final outcome is unlikely to be known before this fall.\nIn the meantime, additional risks are emerging, including the potential for budget, precision and a shift toward multiyear grant funding by the executive branch. These factors are contributing to cautious purchasing behavior among our U.S. academic customers, and we expect this dynamic to persist until there is more certainty around funding.\nTurning back to our pharma end market. uncertainty remains around the potential tariff exposure our pharmaceutical customers may face under the current U.S. administration. While the recently announced U.S. EU trade agreement, which includes a blank at 15% tariff on pharmaceuticals, is a constructive step, the U.S. administration is still proposing up to a 250% tariff on pharmaceutical companies in the future. Compounding this uncertainty is the administration's recent push for most favored nation pricing, which could impact the profitability of the largest pharmaceutical companies and in turn, their reinvestment into R&D.\nAnd finally, turning to our biotech end market. This segment is responding cautiously to the broader uncertainty impacting innovation and commercialization. Concerns around reduced innovation from the academic sector coupled with potentially lower returns on invested capital from clinical pipelines are weighing on sentiment. These pressures stem the possibility of diminished profitability post commercialization due to policy shifts such as MFM pricing.\nAs Kim noted, biotech funding has been notably soft year-to-date with industry reports estimating a decline of over 40% compared to 2024 levels. We do not anticipate a meaningful rebound in funding for smaller biotech companies until there is greater clarity around NIH appropriations, tariff policies and drug pricing reforms. Taking all of these factors into account, we believe Bio-Techne has navigated a highly dynamic and uncertain market environment with disciplined and resilience, delivering low single-digit organic growth in the most recent quarter.\nMoving forward, we anticipate that our organic growth will remain in a low single-digit range until the current headwinds across our end markets begin to subside. That said, we maintain a high degree of confidence that our end markets will return to the long-term historical growth trajectories once these uncertainties are resolved. The underlying secular drivers an aging global population, increasing demand for improved quality life and the accelerating pace of scientific breakthroughs in life sciences remain firmly intact and continues to support the long-term growth outlook for our business.\nIn terms of adjusted operating margin, we remain committed to balancing strategic investments that fuel future growth with productivity initiatives that enhance profitability in today's dynamic environment. A portion of these strategic investments will be funded through the reallocation of resources previously dedicated to the ExoDX franchise, now redirected toward our core growth pillars.\nThese include advancing the next generation of our automated proteomic analysis and spatial biology platforms expanding applications in cell therapy and reinvigorating our core reagents portfolio with targeted investments in organic research and AI-driven protein development. Even with this redirected investment, we expect adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points in fiscal year '26 compared to fiscal 2025, starting flat year-over-year in our first quarter and ramping to roughly 200 basis points higher by Q4.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events.\nI will now turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKim Kelderman\n\nPresident of Diagnostics & Genomics\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Bio-Techne's First Quarter Earnings Call of Fiscal 2026. We began the fiscal year with continued strong execution, navigating a dynamic environment with discipline and strategic focus. Despite these efforts, organic revenue declined 1% in the quarter, primarily due to clinical stage timing from a couple of large customers in our cell therapy business and the anticipated ongoing softness in biotech funding. The headwind in cell therapy reflects the inherent lumpiness of late-stage clinical programs, which is, in this case, driven by favorable FDA Fast Track Designation that support accelerated therapy approval time lines, yet they reduce near-term reagent demand.\nImportantly, underlying market trends remain constructive as demand from our large pharma customers was once again robust, and we saw encouraging signs of stabilization in our U.S. academic end market, particularly as the quarter progressed. Our ProteinSimple instrument franchise continued to build momentum. China delivered its second consecutive quarter of growth and our Spatial Biology business resumed sequential improvement. Operationally, the team delivered sector-leading profitability with adjusted operating margin expanding 90 basis points year-over-year to 29.9%, exceeding our initial expectations. This performance reflects our deliberate focus on productivity and cost management while continuing to invest in the strategic growth pillars that will shape Bio-Techne's future.\nNow let's turn to the performance of our end markets, beginning with our biopharma customers, excluding cell therapy. The divergence between large pharma and emerging biotech spending patterns persisted in the first quarter. Revenue from our large pharma customers remained strong, increasing low double digits, reflecting continued demand for our tools and technologies. In contrast, the challenging funding environment in our biotech end market continued to weigh on spending behavior and resulted in high single-digit declines in Q1. Encouragingly, we are seeing early signs of stabilization in biotech activity levels. These include an uptick in M&A activity, favorable pharma in-licensing trends and the potential for lower interest rates, all of which support a more constructive outlook for investment levels in emerging biotech companies. Global academic markets remained stable overall in Q1. A modest decline in U.S. academic business was offset by mid-single-digit growth in Europe, where demand trends remained healthy. Within the U.S., it was encouraging to see improvement in our run rate business as the quarter progressed.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, revenue declined mid-single digits in the Americas, while both EMEA and Asia delivered low single-digit growth. In China, we achieved our second consecutive quarter of growth, supported by improving CRO pipelines and increased CDMO activity. Growth in the region was primarily driven by strong performance in our ProteinSimple analytical instruments and our Spatial Biology portfolio. Importantly, unlike last quarter, the instrument growth does not appear to be driven by tariff-related dynamics. Instead, it reflects underlying demand strength, and we believe that the business is well positioned for a return to stable growth in the region.\nLet's now turn to our growth pillars, beginning with the Protein Sciences segment, where end market dynamics led to a 3% organic revenue decline. In our cell therapy business, we were pleased to see a couple of our largest customers receive FDA Fast Track Designation. This recognition enables an accelerated clinical development time line and eligibility for priority review by the agency and there with potentially expediting both approval and commercialization of these next-generation therapies. As customers progress through the development project, they typically front-load purchases of the reagents needed for a full completion of a specific clinical phase in their program. We have seen this dynamic play out firsthand at Wilson Wolf, where customer ordering patterns moderated as their clients progress through Phase III clinical trials and shifted their focus to the regulatory filing necessary for FDA approval. This is typically followed by an inflection in demand and a revenue ramp as therapies gain commercial traction. It is this clinical stage timing dynamic that introduced greater lumpiness in our cell therapy business in this quarter.\nContinuing with cell therapy, I'd like to provide a brief update on Wilson Wolf. As a reminder, we currently own 20% of the company and expect to complete the acquisition of the remaining interest by the end of calendar 2027 or potentially sooner, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones. Wilson Wolf is a developer and manufacturer of the market-leading GRx bioreactor line, which enables high-yield, cost-effective workflows for cell therapy manufacturing. The GRx also allows the scaling of production and therewith treat a greater number of patients efficiently. The GRx grant program has successfully seeded hundreds of early-stage cell therapy customers and over half of those also utilize Bio-Techne's GMP reagents. We are very excited about the upcoming acquisition as the combination of Wilson Wolf's bioreactors with Bio-Techne's GMP reagents, our media and the [indiscernible] cytokine delivery system create a compelling, lower cost and scalable manufacturing solution for cell therapy developers.\nLet's now turn to a suite of easy-to-use fully automated proteomic analytical solutions collectively known as ProteinSimple. These platforms are the preferred choice for fast, precise and intuitive protein analysis. Utilization of our expanding installed base remains very strong as customers increasingly rely on these systems to automate both critical and routine laboratory workflows, driving higher productivity in both biopharma and academia. This growing reliance was reflected in the cartridge consumable pull-through, which resumed its double-digit growth trajectory in the quarter. We continue to advance innovation across all 3 of our ProteinSimple instrument platforms, enhancing functionality, productivity and broadening their application scope. A key highlight is the upcoming launch of an ultrasensitive cartridge for our fully automated Simple Plex immunoassay platform branded as Ella. These next-generation assays will deliver a two to fivefold improvement in sensitivity over our current Simple Plex cartridge offering, enabling fymttogram level biomarker detection in plasma samples. This breakthrough holds significant promise for accelerating neurodegenerative disease research and positions Bio-Techne as a leader in this emerging and impactful field. Adoption of our high-throughput Simple Western platform called Leo continues to build momentum with large pharma customers who valuate speed, simplicity and sensitivity in protein quantification and detection. We are very pleased with Leo's commercialization as the platform has exceeded both revenue and placement expectations in its first 3 quarters in the market. Combine this initial momentum with a growing order funnel and Leo is well positioned to become a standout performer in our instrument portfolio.\nLastly, I'd like to highlight the continued success of our Maurice Biologics platform, which delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. This QA/QC solution is benefiting from a current wave of increased bioprocessing activity. Looking ahead, we see recent U.S. manufacturing investment announcements by several large pharmaceutical companies as a potential catalyst for accelerating growth in this business. And finally, our core portfolio of research use-only reagents, including our industry-leading catalog of over 6,000 proteins and 400,000 antibody types continues to demonstrate its enduring value to customers even amid challenging end market conditions. In the first quarter, sales of our core reagents remained consistent with the prior year, underscoring the resilience and essential nature of these tools in supporting foundational research across disciplines.\nNow let's turn to our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment, beginning with our spatial biology portfolio. In Q1, we delivered low single-digit growth in our RNAscope product suite, which enables biopharma and academic researchers to detect and visualize RNA and short microRNA sequences at a single cell level within intact tissue samples. We will further strengthen our leadership in spatial biology with the launch of PximityScope, the first product to enable researchers to interrogate functional protein-protein interactions. This novel assay adds a powerful new dimension to multiomic RNA and protein detection. By introducing this additional layer of information to Spatial Biology, PximityScope enhances researchers' ability to unravel complex biology and its connections to disease. It also embeds Bio-Techne's spatial chemistries more deeply into automated translational research workflows. Momentum also continued with our COMET instrument, which saw solid double-digit growth in bookings year-over-year. Its fully automated multi-omic capabilities are increasingly valued by academic and biopharma customers and enable the discovery of novel biological insights. Spatial biology continues to be our most academically concentrated business with a meaningful presence in biotech as well. Given the funding uncertainties in both end markets, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in this franchise.\nLastly, our Diagnostics business grew mid-single digits in Q1, supported by balanced performance across our core diagnostic controls and our diagnostic kits for laboratories. We continue to see rising interest in our ESR1 test, which monitors resistance to standard therapies in breast cancer patients. Recent clinical trial data reinforced the importance of testing for ESR1 mutations, showing that switching patients that show this mutation to an alternative therapy near double life expectancy compared to the standard treatment. We also launched the AmplideX PML [indiscernible], multiplex QPCR assay designed to detect all 3 major fusion variants associated with APL in a gasiform of leukemia. This assay runs in widely installed QPCR platforms and delivers results in approximately 4 hours. This launch [indiscernible] and hematology menu, alongside the Quanterix BCRA booked and positions us for continued menu expansion. We also announced an expanded agreement with Oxford Nanopore Technologies building on last year's successful launch of the AmplideX Nanopore Carrier Plus Kit. This comprehensive carrier scaling panel targets 11 hard-to-sequence genes in a single workflow, offering laboratories a streamlined and efficient solution for genetic testing. And before I wrap up my prepared remarks, I would like to briefly highlight our progress on sustainability.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we achieved an estimated 40% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions driven by our transition to 100% renewable electricity at our largest site located in Minneapolis, I encourage everyone to review the report in the Corporate and Social Responsibility section of our website. I'm proud of the team's continued progress on this round. To summarize, the Bio-Techne team continues to execute at a high level despite ongoing volatility across some of our end markets. Our focus on productivity and disciplined cost management drove a significant year-over-year operating margin expansion exceeding our expectations to profitability. And while clinical stage timing in cell therapy created a headwind, underlying market trends are constructive. Recent data points suggest improving visibility for academic and our biopharma customers which we expect will translate in stabilizing and ultimately strengthening demand for life science tools and specifically by the techniques product portfolio monthly remains clear. Our customers continue to rely on Bio-Techne's innovative life science tools to drive biological discovery, advanced next-generation therapies and deliver precise diagnostic solutions that improve the quality of life for the global population.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim?\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThank you, Kim. I will begin with additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, followed by thoughts on our forward outlook. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, flat year-over-year with foreign exchange having an immaterial impact. GAAP EPS came in at $0.24, up from $0.21 in the prior year period. Total revenue for Q1 was $286.6 million, representing a 1% year-over-year decline on both an organic and reported basis. Foreign exchange contributed a 1% tailwind, while businesses held for sale created a 1% headwind. Excluding the timing impact from our largest cell therapy customers who received FDA Fast Track Designation, organic growth was plus 1% for the quarter. .\nFrom a geographic lens, North America declined mid-single digits as strength from large pharma was offset by order timing in cell therapy and continued funding pressure in Biotech. Europe grew low single digits, led by consistent performance in academia, while Asia also posted low single-digit growth, marking its second consecutive quarter of sustained momentum. By end market, biopharma declined mid-single digits overall. However, excluding our largest cell therapy customers, biopharma grew low single digits driven by strong pharma demand, but partially offset by biotech softness. Academia was flat with solid growth in Europe, balancing modest declines in the U.S. Below the revenue line, adjusted gross margin was 70.2%, up from 69.5% last year. The improvement was driven by the Exosome Diagnostics divestiture and ongoing productivity initiatives.\nAdjusted SG&A was 32.1% of revenue, nearly flat versus 32.2% last year. R&D expense was 8.2%, also stable compared to 8.3% in the prior year. This consistency reflects the benefits of structural streamlining and disciplined expense management partially offset by targeted investments in strategic growth initiatives. Adjusted operating margin reached 29.9%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was fueled by the Exosome Diagnostics divestiture and productivity gains, partially offset by volume deleverage. Our better-than-expected margin reflects deliberate management of productivity and cost containment measures into maximizing operating leverage in a dynamic environment. Below operating income, net interest expense was $1.8 million, up $0.7 million year-over-year due to the expiration of interest rate hedges. Bank debt at quarter end stood at $300 million, down $46 million sequentially. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $2.7 million, down $1.3 million from the prior year primarily due to foreign exchange gains last year related to overseas cash pooling arrangements that did not recur. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year driven by geographic mix.\nTurning to cash flow and capital deployment. We generated $27.6 million in operating cash flow during our Q1 with $5.4 million in net capital expenditures. The year-over-year decline in operating cash flow was due to the timing of cash tax payments. We returned $12.4 million to shareholders via dividends and ended the quarter with $156.4 million average diluted shares outstanding down 3% year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong with $145 million in cash and a total leverage ratio well below 1x EBITDA. M&A continues to be a top priority for capital allocation.\nNow let's review our segment performance, beginning with Protein Sciences. Q1 reported sales were $202.2 million, down 1% year-over-year. Organic revenue declined 3% with a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Excluding the cell therapy timing impact, organic growth was plus 1%. Growth was led by our proteomic analytical tools business with notable strength from large customers. Protein Sciences operating margin was 38.4%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to volume deleverage and promotional activity, partially offset by operational productivity. In our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment, Q1 sales were $79.5 million, down 4% year-over-year. The divestiture of Exosome Diagnostics negatively impacted reported growth by 7%, resulting in 3% organic growth for the segment. Diagnostics products grew mid-single digits, while Spatial Biology was flat. It's worth noting that this segment grew mid-teens organically in the prior year created a challenging comparison.\nSegment operating margin improved to 11.2%, up from 5.1% last year, driven by the Exosome Diagnostics divestiture and productivity initiatives. We expect continued margin expansion as our common spatial biology platform scales. In summary, the team delivered strong execution in Q1 despite persistent market headwinds, including biotech funding pressures, NIH blood uncertainty and lingering tariff concerns. Encouragingly, recent data points suggest improving end market clarity. While biotech funding remains sound, approximately 19% year-to-date through October. Industry reports show a 6% sequential increase in our Q1 and October making strongest funding month of calendar 2025, combined with recent large pharma pricing and onshoring agreements with the U.S. administration, we anticipate improving conditions for biopharma.\nOn the NIH front, September outlays rose 8% year-over-year, closing the government's fiscal year on a strong note. While the current government shutdown cloud's visibility into the fiscal year 2026 budget, [indiscernible] house appropriation bills suggest a flat NIH budget year-over-year. Encouragingly, we saw signs of stabilization in the U.S. academic market as the quarter progressed. As Kim noted, we're excited about the FDA Fast Track designation awarded to our largest cell therapy customers. These designations accelerate clinical time lines but reduce near-term reagent demand. Following strong ordering in early fiscal year 2025, these customers are now progressing to their Phase III trials, resulting in a temporary slowdown in reagent purchases. We expect this headwind to intensify in Q2, impacting growth by approximately 400 basis points year-over-year before moderating in the second half of the fiscal year. Despite these headwinds, we anticipate overall Q2 organic growth to be consistent with Q1. This outlook reflects continued strength in pharma, renewed growth in China, a rebound in spatial biology and gradual stabilization in U.S. academic and biotic end markets. As we lap prior year headwinds that began with the U.S. administration's policy changes in early calendar 2025, we expect a return to positive organic growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\nFrom a margin perspective, we remain focused on balancing growth investments with operational efficiency. We're pleased with the margin upside delivered in Q1 and remain on track to achieve at least 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full fiscal year. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call now back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations & Corporate Development\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Kim Kelderman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne.\nBefore we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be consider ward-looking statements. including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2024 identify certain is that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section.\nDuring the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Investor Relations section of our Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, in the coming weeks, we will be participating in the Cowen, Leerink and Barclays health care conferences. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKim Kelderman\n\nPresident of Diagnostics & Genomics\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered yet another strong fiscal quarter that exceeded the initial projections that we made at the beginning of our fiscal year, and the improving biopharma end market, particularly on the large pharma side benefited our GMP reagents in their protein analytical implementation. This, combined with continued traction in our ExosomeDx and spatial biology franchises drove our 9% organic revenue growth for the quarter.\nWe are also seeing the benefits of the organizational and operational efficiency improvements that we have implemented over the last 1.5 years. During the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points sequentially to 30.1%, and I'm confident that we are well positioned for ongoing improvement in our peer-leading operating margin profile as our end markets continue to recover. Jim will provide more details on these results later in the call.\nI hope that many of you had a chance to see the latest corporate presentation we provided last month during the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. For those that have not seen it, I would encourage you to visit the Investor Relations section of Bio-Techne's website. We presented the company's strategy through a slightly different lens this year by outlining 3 major challenges we help our customers solve. We enable the discovery of novel biological insights, we support the development and manufacturing of advanced therapeutics, and we enable precision diagnostics. Our product portfolio and solutions are uniquely positioned to reliably and efficiently support our customers in advancing science across these sectors.\nNow let's review our Q2 results, beginning with an overview across our end markets and geographies. Sales to our biopharma end markets increased mid-teens in the quarter as we experienced strength in both the U.S. and European regions. This strong performance included a notable improvement from large pharma customers with particular strength in both GMP and reagent orders as well as in our protein analysis instrument portfolio.\nFor our academic end market, the team delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth. As a reminder, our academic end markets grew upper single digits in the prior year period, and we achieved this quarter's mid-single-digit revenue growth despite the challenging comp as well as the reduced number of selling days related to the midweek holidays in December.\nNow for our regions. In the Americas, we grew low double digits for the quarter. This performance was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong demand from our cell therapy customers as well as the strength in our automated protein analysis portfolio. Our EMEA region grew low double digits as well, which was also driven by our automated protein analysis portfolio, which grew more than 20%. In addition, we expanded our geographic reach through 2 new distribution agreements. First, we announced a partnership of Leader Life Sciences to fortify access to our portfolio across the Gulf cooperating countries. We follow this with a distribution agreement with Medcomtech to expand access to our portfolio in Turkey and Azerbaijan. In China, sales declined low single digits as the challenging economic environment remained a headwind to growth in the geography. It's worth noting that the Q2 performance is in line with our expectations that the negative growth would ease and will shift to modest positive growth in our fiscal Q3 due to the expectation that the targeted stimulus program and a modest improvement in government funding will slowly materialize.\nAs a side note, Jim and I were just in China to visit our team and of course, to meet a variety of our customers. It was clear that our team remains extremely motivated and committed to our mission, and our customers continue to value the consistent quality across the breadth of our portfolio. In the long term, the modernization of health care will remain a high priority for the Chinese government and Bio-Techne is looking forward to playing a key role in enabling the evolution of health care for its citizens and the world.\nNow let's discuss our growth pillars, starting with our portfolio of cell therapy workflow solutions. During the quarter, we experienced robust growth within our GMP reagents portfolio as customers that are progressing their advanced therapeutics for later-stage clinical trials require materially more temper reagents. We now have over 500 customers lying on our GMP reagents for their cell therapy across all stages of development. Within this expanding customer base, 85 are in various phases of clinical trials, including 6 currently in Phase III.\nFor Q2, our GMP reagents revenue increased over 90%. As a reminder, our GMP reagents business can be lumpy as orders from customers further along their clinical trials can be much larger, therefore, order timing can make quarterly growth volatile. So we view trailing 12-month revenue as a better performance indicator.\nOur current TTM for our GMP reagents sits just over 40% organically.\nNow let's discuss our protein analysis growth pillar, where we experienced strong sales momentum across our portfolio of automated workflow solutions. Once again, the ease of use, precision and reproducibility offered by our Simple Western automated Western blood instrument, our Simple Plex automated multiplexing immunoassay system, and our [indiscernible] biologics platform drove strong consumable utilization on our installed base. Customers continue to appreciate the labor and cost savings these innovative platforms bring to their laboratories. Overall, instrument specific consumables increased high teens in the quarter. This marks 8 out of the last 9 quarters where we delivered at least double-digit consumable growth across our growing installed base.\nIt was not just consumables that showed strength, though. We also experienced growth in new instrument placements. Globally, our instruments increased low single digits for the quarter and grew mid-single digits, excluding China. This marks the first quarter in the last 2 years in which we delivered positive instrument growth.\nSeparately, I'd like to congratulate the team on the successful early access launch of our next-generation, high-throughput Simple Western platform called LEO. The team capitalized on our growing order funnel and shipped several of these high-end LEO instruments at the end of the quarter.\nWrapping up our platform discussion, I'd like to give an update on Maurice Flex. Our biopharma customers are increasingly utilizing Maurice flex for protein analysis in a rapidly growing number of gene therapy applications as well as sample fractionation methods for mass spectrometry sample preparation. During the quarter, we announced a co-marketing agreement with Waters Corporation, aiming to expand the market awareness of the biotherapeutic characterization capabilities of the Maurice Flex.\nNow let's turn to our core portfolio of research use only, or RUO, proteomics reagents. Let me highlight that over the last 4 years, we've amassed a catalog of over 6,000 proteins and 400,000 antibody types. This biological content is relied upon by customers across the globe to gain novel insights into biological pathways to develop and manufacture adavance therapeutics and to enable precision diagnostics. Our everyday run rate business continued to modestly improve sequentially while larger bulk orders of our RUO reagents to biopharma customers also picked up in the quarter. We view this as an indicator that our end markets are gradually starting to improve. All in, our core portfolio of RUO reagents grew low single digits in the quarter.\nSticking with our core reagent portfolio, I wanted to give an update on our AI initiatives within Bio-Techne. As we have mentioned in the past, we see tremendous potential leveraging AI to develop proteins and antibodies with enhanced functionality. During the quarter, we continued to utilize our internal know-how and our fast data set, which we generated over the last several decades to train our generative AI models and develop designer proteins. These patentable proteins are engineered to exhibit hyperactive properties, announced heat stability and other mobile features. These attributes are relevant for many applications, including cell therapies. We added 4 new designer proteins to our catalog in Q2, bringing the total portfolio to 6. You can expect a steady cadence of new designer protein launches going forward.\nOverall, I'm very excited for the Protein Sciences team as they delivered 8% organic revenue growth. This is the best performance of this segment since the market headwinds that were related to the aftermath of the pandemic began in the first quarter of our fiscal 2023.\nNow we will move to the growth pillars within our Diagnostics and spatial biology segment, which delivered 12% organic growth in the quarter. That started with our spatial biology business, where we continue to make significant progress with the launch of the COMET system, a fully automated multiomic spatial biology instrument. As a reminder, we recently enabled our new scope capabilities on the COMET to allow for visualization of up to 24 proteins and 12 RNA targets simultaneously. We are actively upgrading COMET's installed base to enable researchers to fully leverage the multiomic capabilities of the platform. Additionally, we continue to launch Bio-Techne's RNA systems-branded antibodies for use on the COMET system. The RNA scope capabilities, paired with the growing portfolio of validated antibodies, will support a consumable stream that is expected to be the highest pull-through of any instrument under the Bio-Techne umbrella.\nDuring the quarter, our Special Biology revenue increased mid-teens, and we are positioned for continued leadership in this fast-evolving space.\nNext, I'd like to give an update on our precision diagnostic tools business, previously referred to as a molecular diagnostics business. We believe the new name is a better reflection of the focus of this team, which is to provide clinical laboratories with precise diagnostic tools that leverage our exosome-based diagnostic technology combined with Asuragen's proprietary chemistries. During the quarter, we announced the launch of a test for ESR1 mutations in breast cancer. This is the first kitted test to utilize our exosome-based technology and Asuragen chemistries. We commercialized this test through a laboratory channel, which we also obtained for the acquisition of Asuragen. Meanwhile, our ExoDx prostate cancer test continues to enjoy rapid adoption as unit volume grew more than 30% in the quarter.\nIn summary, I'm extremely pleased with the execution by the Bio-Techne team across all our businesses globally. We believe that the strength of our growth pillars in cell and gene therapy and proteomics analysis, combined with the momentum that we saw in our core products, are indicative of an early-stage recovery in key biopharma end markets. If you then add to that the performance of our best-in-class Spatial Biology franchise and our high-value Precision Diagnostic Tools platform, you will understand why I'm confident that we have positioned Bio-Techne for continued differentiated growth going forward.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim?\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThank you, Kim. I'll start with some additional details on our Q2 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $0.42 compared to $0.40 in the prior year, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable $0.02 impact.\nGAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.22 compared to $0.17 in the prior year. Q2 revenue was $297 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year on both a reported and organic basis.\nRecapping our organic growth by region and end market in Q2 that you previously heard from Kim. North America and Europe increased low double digits year-over-year, driven by strength from our biopharma customers particularly in our cell therapy and proteomic analysis portfolios, while China and APAC decreased low single digits.\nBy end market in Q2, excluding China, biopharma increased mid-teens and academia increased mid-single digits in the quarter. Our biopharma business benefited from larger reagent and instrument orders in our pharma and cell therapy end markets, while our run rate business in biopharma showed modest improvement year-over-year.\nBelow revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 70.5% in the quarter compared to 69.7% last year, driven by the impact of favorable product mix and productivity initiatives.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q2 was 32% of revenue compared to 31.2% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 8.5% of revenue compared to 8.4% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals, partially offset by the benefit of structural streamlining and diligent expense control.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q2 was 30.1%, up 110 basis points sequentially and flat compared to the prior year due to the impact of favorable volume leverage and cost control, offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals. We continue to execute cost containment measures and prioritize our growth initiatives to drive efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of optimizing operating leverage during the ensuing market recovery.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $0.7 million, decreasing $2.7 million compared to the prior year due to lower net debt levels. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at $300 million, unchanged from last quarter.\nOther adjusted nonoperating expense was $1.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $4.4 million compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by the foreign exchange impact related to our overseas cash pooling arrangement.\nMoving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 21.5%, down 50 basis points compared to prior year due to geographic mix.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $84.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $6.8 million. Also during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $12.7 million in dividends and $75.6 million through a 1.1 million share stock buyback. We finished the quarter with 160.6 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur balance sheet finished Q2 in a strong position with $177.5 million in cash, and our total leverage ratio remains well below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $211.6 million, with reported revenue increasing 7% compared to the prior year. The exclusion of the fetal bovine serum business, which was classified as held-for-sale business and subsequently divested in the quarter, unfavorably impacted reported segment revenue growth by 1%. Thus, organic revenue for this segment increased 8%. As Kim previously mentioned, the strength in the segment's organic growth was driven by our protein analysis portfolio as well as our GMP protein business where several large orders that we initially expected to be placed in our third quarter were requested by our cell therapy customers in Q2.\nOperating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 41.2%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to prior year as the impact of favorable volume leverage, cost management and structural alignment initiatives were partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and spatial biology segment, Q2 sales were $84.1 million, with both reported and organic growth increasing 12% compared to the same quarter last year. All 3 businesses within this segment are core diagnostics reagents, Facial Biology and Precision Diagnostic tools, all contributed nicely to growth.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment operating margin, at 3.9%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to the prior year's 6%. Excluding the impact of incentive compensation accrual reinstatement, operating margins would have expanded approximately 200 basis points year-over-year due to the impact of favorable volume leverage. We anticipate improvement in the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology operating margin as Lunaphore continues to scale.\nIn summary, Q2 was a very solid quarter. Earlier than expected in the fiscal year, we saw improvements in all types of order activity from our larger pharma customers, including CapEx spend for instruments, bulk order reagents requests and increased daily run rate purchases. We view this as a positive sign that much of the R&D pipeline repositioning by our large pharma customers is behind us, and that a more broad-based increase in R&D funding from discovery through the clinic is more likely in calendar year 2025.\nWe also saw continued outperformance in our GMP protein business in Q2, although much of this unexpected upside came from the timing of large orders by several cell therapy customers who are progressing their programs through clinical trials. Thus, the organic growth outlook for the second half of fiscal year '25 that we've provided the past 2 quarters is still intact. For Q3 specifically, this means the upper range of mid-single-digit organic growth.\nAs you think about our expected organic growth performance in Q3 relative to Q2, there are a couple of headwinds to consider. First, the year-over-year comp in Q3 is more difficult by 4 percentage points than it was in Q2 as our revenue declined 2% in Q2 of last year and then grew 2% the following Q3. Also, the previously mentioned timing of several large GMP protein orders that we had in our recent Q2 are not expected to reoccur in Q3. However, on a more positive note, the earlier than expected momentum we are seeing from our larger pharma customers, as well as an expected return to growth in China in Q3, allows us to hold the organic revenue outlook that we shared since the beginning of our fiscal year. The early improvement in large pharma activity also strengthens our confidence that we can exit our Q4 with organic growth in the high single digits as we have predicted all year.\nAs it pertains to reported revenue growth, with the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar at current foreign exchange rates, we do expect a headwind of approximately 1% of sales in the back half of our fiscal year. As much of the top line foreign exchange falls directly to the bottom line of our P&L, we do expect a negative impact to adjusted operating margins by approximately 50 basis points. Thus, we are now forecasting adjusted operating margins in the second half of fiscal year '25 to be between 50 and 150 basis points higher than the prior year. This still represents a significant step-up in margin from the first half of the fiscal year due to higher volume leverage, continued improving product mix and the full impact from productivity initiatives.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations & Corporate Development\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Kim Kelderman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne.\nBefore we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. Company's 10-K for fiscal year 2023 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call.

During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Investor Relations section of the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com.\nSeparately, in the coming weeks, we will be participating in the Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Baird conferences. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKim Kelderman\n\nPresident of Diagnostics & Genomics\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results came in, in line with our initial expectations. Continued stabilization of our end markets, combined with excellent execution by the Bio-Techne team, led to a 1% year-over-year organic revenue growth.\nThis quarter wraps up our fiscal 2024, where our core portfolio of research and [indiscernible], together with the 4 growth verticals that leverage this content, delivered a 1% growth in what has proven to be a challenging fiscal year. It's worth noting that these growth hurdles have enabled Bio-Techne to consistently outperform our peer group during this unprecedented post-COVID pandemic period.\nDuring this period, we experienced a challenging funding environment for biotech and a significant R&D budget recalibration by large pharma and academia customers. Let me give you some examples of the business dynamics we've experienced throughout our fiscal year.\nFirst, [indiscernible] and the local franchise branded protein symbols. This business provides productivity tools for laboratories commonly used to expand laboratory capacity. However, these products are also well positioned for customers that are operating under constraint budgets and are looking to replace manual processes with simple and effective automation.\nHere, we saw mid-single-digit growth for the fiscal year, led by Simple Plex and Simple Western sub-launch, bolstered by double-digit growth for instrument-related consumables across all platforms. Our cell and gene therapy [indiscernible], which is led by our quality GMP protein products, also grew mid-single digits for the year and added more customers even while biotech funding had a multiyear low.\nIn our spatial biology vertical, we saw solid growth in fiscal year '24 despite the budget reset by our pharma customers. Our new special biology in [indiscernible] is seeing a robust adoption and will bring accelerated growth to this vertical in the years ahead. And last, the ongoing traction and market adoption of our ExoDx prostate set, together with new product launch within our surging franchise, drove double-digit growth in our Molecular Diagnostics growth vertical all year long. It is these 4 growth verticals that carry us to the challenging post-COVID dynamic market slowdown, and we are confident that these same verticals will drive accelerated growth as our core market and our core portfolio of 40 agents gradually recover back to long-term historical growth rate.\nOver the last 48 years, we've mapped the core portfolio of research reagents and diagnostic tools, which include a catalog of over 6,000 protein and 400,000 antibody types. These products are critical components to many foundational workflows, virtually all life science academic and biopharma research labs globally. Not only do the reagents unlock the power of scientific discovery, they are also the synergistic force behind our 4 growth verticals.\nThe 5-year CAGR for these growth verticals is over 20%, and they accounted for about 45% of Bio-Techne's revenue in fiscal 2024, which is significantly higher than the 30% of revenue in fiscal 2019. And that's only 5 years ago.\nBefore we get into the details of the most recent quarter, I'd like to welcome Dr. Judith Klimovsky to Bio-Techne's Board of Directors. Dr. Klimovsky is currently the Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Genmab, and she brings a significantly end market, scientific and international experience to Bio-Techne's Board. Dr. Klimovsky's insight and guidance will be very beneficial as we continue to execute our strategy and expand globally. Welcome to our Board, Judith.\nNow let's start with a discussion of our end markets and geographies, beginning with the biopharma market, where we saw continued stabilization from our biopharma customers. Overall, BioPharma, the low single digits in the quarter, it was relatively consistent on a sequential basis. There is a broad awareness that biotech funding has been stronger for the first half of the calendar year, which is good news after a very challenging '23. We anticipate that this recovery will bring incremental confidence to the capital-dependent companies and that this will eventually drive increased demand for our portfolio with life science products in the coming quarters.\nAcademia decreased low single digits in the quarter, reflecting a particularly challenging comparison with the same period last year during which revenue increased upper single digits. From a geographic perspective, North America and Europe both declined low single digits in the quarter, reflecting the aforementioned constraints in biopharma and academic end markets. Although it is worth noting that Europe had particularly difficult comparables that it had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter last year.\nFor China, the stabilization trend that we have experienced over the past several quarters forunately continued into Q4. [indiscernible] to recovery process, we would expect a portfolio of research and reagents to be the first to return to growth, followed by our instrument portfolio. This prognosis strengthened by the fact that our team in China delivered their second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our core reagent portfolio. This performance was paired with mid-single-digit growth in our biologics portfolio, which consists primarily of the Maurice family of instruments and associated consumables.\nOverall, China declined high single digits in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations at last year's stimulus resulted in a comp of mid-teens growth for this geography in last year's Q4. While the impact of the recently announced stimulus will likely not translate into revenue growth for the region until the second half of our fiscal year, we are encouraged by the overall stabilization in this region and the early return of the growth to Aviation.\nAnd let's discuss our growth pillars in more detail, starting with protein simple implementation within the Protein Sciences segment, where overall organic growth was low single digit for the quarter. As mentioned, robust utilization of these productivity tools drove double-digit consumable growth. It's worth highlighting that our Q4 is the 7th consecutive quarter in which the consumables related to our instruments to at least double digits, which indicates strong utilization of our global installed base. [indiscernible] analysis implement provide automation, decision, reproducibility and labor savings, which makes them increasingly ingrained in both academic and biopharma workflows.\nOur automated multiplexing immunoassay instrument named Ella was a standout performer within the protein simple portfolio as both the instrument and related consumables increased double digits in the quarter. Ella is quickly becoming the go-to platform for cell and gene therapy customers for viral titer and release testing and are also seeing rapid adoption among CROs looking for high divisibility paired with high sensitivity in an easy-to-use, fully automated immunoassay platform.\nRelated to immunoassay technology, we recently announced an investment in Sphere Bio's Series A funding lab. Sphere Bio is an innovation leader in the development and manufacture of ultra sensitive immunoassay capable of measuring protein markers at an etho molar levels from sub-microliter simple volumes. Sphere Bio's assays run on QPCR equipment, which is routinely found in research and clinical facilities, therewith tapping into a very broad existing installed base. Sphere Bio's initial assay will focus on key biomarkers supporting translational research in Alzheimer's disease.\nWithin our Simple franchise, we also recently announced the latest addition to our Simple Western platform called Leo. As a reminder, our Simple Western platforms automate the manual, the boring, cumbersome, time-consuming and inconsistent Western blotting process that is commonly used to identify proteins in complex mixtures.\nLeo is the high throughput automated Western blot system, enabling the simultaneous analysis up to 100 samples in a single 3-hour run. We are excited to introduce this next-generation system, which is expected to begin shipping in the second half of our fiscal year '25. We remain the only fully automated Western blot technology providers on the market and see a long run rate for the future growth with this portfolio as our current market penetration is below 20%.\nLike our other insulin platforms, Simple Western continues to gain traction in cell and gene therapy application as the system is increasingly used for [indiscernible] protein consultation and relative potency assets. For example, [indiscernible] Therapeutics recently reported positive top line data from the second cohort of patients in a Phase Ib study related to the treatment of a kidney disease called ADPKD. [indiscernible] utilized Simple Western platform to develop high-performance biomarker assays to measure various protein, [indiscernible], as part of this study. We look forward to working with Giles and, of course, with all our other partners to further the advancement of cell and gene therapy. I'll now shift to the other growth pillars in our protein plants segment, our own [indiscernible] therapy business unit.\nThis growth vertical includes our proteomic reasons and scalable workflow solution that enables our customers to accelerate preclinical clinical and eventually the commercialization of these next-generation therapeutics. As we've mentioned in the past, order coming from large customers can create quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in our GMP proteins business, and that was indeed the case in our Q4. As a sign of underlying strength, however, we are pleased to see continued growth in the number of customers utilizing our highly active GMD protein. We will continue to actively seed the market to ensure we partner with our customers early in their development journey.\nWithin our team mediation buffering, we continue to drive significant growth in our GMP small molecules business. These small molecules are key components in the reprogramming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes is our key to regenerative medicine workflows. We are making good progress with our new GMP facility in Bristol, U.K. which positions us well to meet current and forecasted demand for those critical reagents. This small molecule business grew nearly 50% for the quarter and is quickly becoming a material contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy results.\nIn total, a protein segment declined 3% organically for the quarter and declined 2% for the fiscal year. Remember that our Protein Sciences segment is where we have the most exposure to both China and the biopharma end market that this segment is positioned to see the most significant improvement as these end markets start to recover.\nNow let's discuss the growth pillars in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue grew by 9% in the quarter and 6% for the full fiscal year. Our molecular diagnostics growth pillar performed exceptionally well as organic revenue growth topped 20%. The value proposition of our ExoDx prostate test continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. The depth provides critical information to man with the gray zone PSA scores and whether to proceed or not to proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy.\nDuring Q4, ExoDx prostate volumes increased by almost 35%. We are seeing momentum across the various KPIs we track for ExoDx prostate test, including a 30% sequential increase in the number of physicians ordering 25% to more ExoDx prostate test per quarter. Rounding out of molecular diagnostics business, the Asuragen brand delivered another strong quarter as the sensitivity and specificity of our proprietary FA chemistry drive global adoption of our carrier screening as well as our oncology kits. This led to midteens overall growth for the business, and we continue to advance innovative molecular diagnostic products through our pipeline and are looking forward to the launch of our exosome-based ESR1 mutation kits for breast cancer monitoring as well as the expanded carrier screening assay in the coming months.\nNow let's discuss our spatial biology growth pillar, where once again, demand for our fully automated, high-throughput, hyperplex spatial biology platform called COMET outpaced our manufacturing capacity in the quarter. Cross-organizational manufacturing team continues to implement production process improvements and is making good progress, scaling capacity to meet current and forecasted common demands.\nDuring the quarter, we enabled RNA detection and visualization on COMET with the launch of RNAscope HiPlex capabilities for the instrument. Following this launch, COMET is now capable of detecting and visualizing up to 24 proteins and solve RNA targets simultaneously, creating a highly differentiated multiomic system for the rapidly growing spatial biology market. These enhanced capabilities are in the hands of our initial set of key opinion leaders and will be rolling out across our installed base over the coming months.\nIn summary, the team delivered another solid quarter and another solid fiscal year in this challenging funding environment. As our end markets equilibrate back to a nonpandemic environment, we are well positioned to reinvigorate growth across our portfolio of research reagent and continued momentum across our 4 growth verticals.\nI'm extremely proud of the execution by the Bio-Techne team in the stabilizing but still challenging end market. I'm also confident in our ability to deliver differentiated financial performance as our end markets progress through the recovery cost. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim?\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Kim. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q4 and fiscal 2024 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the year ahead. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.49 compared to $0.55 in the prior year quarter, with foreign exchange having a material impact on EPS. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.25 compared to $0.47 from the prior year. Q4 revenue was $306.1 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and a 1% increase on an organic basis.\nAcquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth. For the full fiscal year 2024, revenue approached $1.2 billion and organic growth was comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Looking at our organic growth by region and market Q4, North America and Europe decreased low single digits year-over-year, while China decreased by single digits. APAC outside of China increased low double digits overall, with Japan and Australia both benefiting from growth in cell and gene therapy and regional expansion of our surgeon portfolio, respectively, while lower government funding and macro constraints continue to impact South Korea. Our end market in Q4, excluding China, both biopharma and academia declined low single digits in the quarter. As Kim previously mentioned, we continue to see sequential global stability in our biopharma end market and academia faced tougher year-over-year comps this quarter.\nBelow revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.6% in the same quarter of the prior year, driven by the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q4 was 29.8% of revenue compared to 26.8% in the prior year. R&D expense in Q4 was 7.8% of revenue, consistent with the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Lump acquisition as well as the quarterly timing of annual incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 33.5%, a decrease of 360 basis points from the prior year period, but an increase of 50 basis points sequentially. Excluding the Lunaphore, acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 100 basis points lower than the prior year due to the impact of unfavorable volume leverage and product mix.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q4 was $0.5 million, decreasing $1 million compared to the prior year period due to lower debt levels. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $303 million, a decrease of $70 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $0.5 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our [ 3% ] share of Wilson Wolf adjusted net income, partially offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash [indiscernible] arrangements.\nMoving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 22%, consistent throughout fiscal '24, but up 200 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $75.5 million of cash was generating operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $18 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.6 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 160.7 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur balance sheet finished Q4 in a strong position with $107.8 million and our total leverage ratio remains well below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains the top priority for capital allocation. Now let's discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment.\nQ4 reported sales were $214 million, which reported revenue decreasing 4% compared to the prior year period. As discussed in last quarter's call, on a strategic review of our portfolio, we have decided to invest to feel bovine serum or FPS business. FPS is approximately $10 million annual revenue business with an operating margin profile and long-term growth rate below the company average. The exclusion of FPS unfavorably impacted reported segment revenue growth by 1%. Thus, organic revenue for the segment decreased.\nAs a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as unfavorable volume and product mix were partially offset by cost management and structural alignment initiatives.\nNow turning to the Diagnostics Jump Summit. [indiscernible] were $90.7 million, with reported growth increasing 15% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the segment was 9% with the Lunaphore acquisition having a 6% impact. On Protein Diagnostics grow vertical once again led segment growth.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.5%. The segment's operating margin decreased compared to the prior year's 18.5%, due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition. Excluding Lunaphore, the segment's operating margin would have been over 20%.\nDiagnostics and Genomics steadily improved operating margins throughout fiscal '24, benefiting from the integration of lump and sequentially increasing volume leverage. The segment's operating margin improved 320 basis points decline from Q3 and improved from nearly breakeven operating margin at the beginning of the year in Q1.\nIn summary, as we reflect on this past fiscal year, it has really been a multiyear unwinding of a massive investment that occurred in our industry and end markets during the COVID pandemic. We are pleased that our strategic portfolio positioning, together with a resilient execution by our 3,100 employees, has enabled Bio-Techne's annual revenue to be higher today than it was before the unwinding began.\nWe are encouraged that the past 2 quarters of sequential stabilization in our end markets suggest that the unwinding is largely behind us. Now our industry waits for a return to normalized market growth, which were Life Sciences, we believe, is mid-single-digit growth over the long term. How long will it take for this recovery to happen is a challenge for anyone to predict. But there are indications that a gradual recovery in the back half of calendar year 2024 and throughout calendar 2025 is a real possibility. These indications include the following.\nOEM customer destocking appears to have abated. Biotech funding in the first half of calendar year 2024 has improved significantly from 2023 levels. Large pharma customers may have completed the realignment of their R&D pipeline priorities by the end of calendar 2024 with the pandemic now in the rearview mirror and the implications of new pharma industry-specific government regulation better understood. And finally, the China region should realize a lift in instrument growth at the start of calendar 2025 due to government stimulus that has been announced.\nAs our end markets gradually recover, we believe that biotech needs relative revenue growth. Outperformance will also continue. Value proposition at our Proteome analysis platforms have demonstrated to our customers during downturn has resonated in strong instrument-based consumable growth the past 2 years. And by our calculation, there is pent-up demand and needed capacity for more instruments.\nOur cell and gene therapy offering has demonstrated value proposition by adding new customers throughout the past 2 years, even when new biotech funding has been drastically reduced. Our spatial biology growth vertical now has an automated solution that is unmatched in its speed and multi-omic capabilities that will also pull through larger quantities of our gold standard RNA scope and antibody reagents.\nAnd last but not least, our Molecular Diagnostics growth vertical is already in growth acceleration mode as its unique and underpenetrated portfolio of products continue to take market share. Thus, the gradual road to end market recovery over the next 18 months, together with our expectation for continued outperformance forms our baseline case for Bio-Techne's organic revenue growth in fiscal '25.\nOur current momentum suggests low single-digit growth in the first half of the year with a possibility of mid-single-digit growth once the higher biotech funding returns into biotech spending. Our organic growth gradually accelerate to the high single digits in the second half of the year as Chinese stimulus funds are released and assuming large pharma budgets are normalized for the calendar year 2025.\nAs we look to adjusted operating margin for the year ahead, we intend to fund all new investments with productivity initiatives and cover inflation with pricing actions, allowing the anticipated volume leverage to drop through to the bottom line. However, following a year of missed incentive compensation targets, there will need to be a reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals for both forces and commission. The impact of this reinstatement will create an approximately 100 basis point headwind to fiscal year '25's full year adjusted operating margin. and more severely impact the first half of the year than the back half.\nThus [indiscernible] that first half adjusted operating margin for fiscal year '25 be approximately 200 to 300 basis points lower than prior year and the second half margin to be approximately 100 to 200 basis points higher than the prior year. First half of the year, we'll have margin headwinds related to the incentive compensation reinstatement as well as continued negative product mix.\nWhile the second half margin should be at some greater revenue volume leverage, planned productivity initiatives and improving pigments. Assuming the indicators that we are all seeing are correct, fiscal year '25 should be the year of gradual recovery for our end markets, and that allow us to exit the year poised for double-digit growth in a multiyear run towards adjusted operating margins of 35% as per our long-term objectives.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations & Corporate Development\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Kim Kelderman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2023 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call.\nThe company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Investor Relations section of our Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be presenting at the Bank of America benchmark, Leerink, William Blair, Jefferies and Scotiabank conferences in the coming weeks. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events.\nI will now turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKim Kelderman\n\nPresident of Diagnostics & Genomics\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter outperformed our initial expectations as several of the green shoots we've discussed during our last earnings call continue to sprout and combined with excellent execution by our Bio-Techne team contributed to delivering 2% year-over-year organic revenue growth.\nWe're looking forward to seeing these green shoots further develop as the headwinds we have faced, namely the biotech funding and the macroeconomic challenges in China continue to stabilize and eventually improve. Our team demonstrated that our product portfolio can show relative strong performance in the stabilizing but still challenging end markets. And therefore, we are confident that we can perform extremely well when our end markets fully recover.\nAdditionally, we delivered this quarter's growth while we continue to focus on profitability. The recent initiatives to drive efficiencies across the organization while investing to position the business for future growth are taking hold. And this shows by our adjusted operating margin increasing sequentially by 290 basis points to 33%. Our growth pillars within our portfolio continue to lead to our strong performance with a new quarterly record for our GMP reagents business, a continued increase in adoption of our ExoDx prostate test, robust utilization trends across our proteomic analytical tools portfolio and strong demand for comment on fully automated special biology instrument.\nI will double-click on these highlights and encouraging trends later in the call. First, I'd like to bring to your attention. The Bio-Techne's recent recognition by site app and reagent search and data services company. Bio-Techne did not receive just one, but two awards. The first award I would like to mention was received for being the ELISA Kit Supplier of the Year. This important designation is awarded to the ELISA kit manufacturer that receives the most citations throughout the year.\n[indiscernible] are an important indicator of market adoption, particularly within academia. We are proud of our leading portfolio of ELISA stemming from a long history of innovation. Site app also recognized Bio-Techne's RNAscope HiPlex 12 with the Innovation Award. That is acknowledging its role in enabling spatial detection of RNA in tissue. Our overall spatial biology efforts were also recognized as Bio-Techne was highly commended for educational initiative of the year, which is related to our ongoing work to enhance patient will [indiscernible] research and education. This recognition is representative of our company's vision to work together with customers to unlock the possibilities of size.\nThe second topic I want to highlight is related to artificial intelligence. Given the significant potential that AI and machine learning bring to the advancing science, I want to describe [indiscernible] of one of the many ways our team is proactively and safely, leveraging important tools. As you already know, Bio-Techne is the global leader in research use only proteins. Researchers from around the world rely on our portfolio of highly bioactive proteins for many important laboratory workflow. Some examples of these workflows include cell growth and differentiation, antibody production and screening as well as biomarkers in disease monitoring.\nWe are leveraging AI capabilities to create new [indiscernible], hyperactive designer proteins and other reagents with new functionalities. For over 40 years, Bio-Techne has been on the leading edge of protein development and bioactivity. Today, we are using the power of AI to increase that lead even further. Now let's get deeper into our quarterly results, starting with an overview of our end markets followed by geographies. Our biopharma end market performance, led by our cell and gene therapy growth vertical improved sequentially with a low single-digit increase compared to the prior [indiscernible] quarter. Industry reports point to a recovery in biotech funding during the first calendar year of 2024 with estimates suggesting significantly higher funding levels compared to pre-COVID periods.\nHowever, this increase in funding comes after a December quarter that was an 8-year low. So it may be too early to call this a new trend. But nonetheless, it's a green shoot that appears to be taking root. And if so, could blossom into meaningful revenue growth as we get into our fiscal year 2025. On the academic side, we delivered low single-digit revenue growth, even though we had a tough comparable from robust mid-teens performance in Europe last year.\nWithin the U.S. and Europe, academic budgets remain stable and their spatial biology and proteomic instrument growth pillars outperformed in these end markets. Now I will discuss the 3 geographies. North America improved currently with year-over-year growth in the low single digits. This improvement was led by a strong performance in [stall] and gene therapy. Europe declined mid-single digits as mid-teens growth in the prior year period stated at [indiscernible] for the geography.\nHowever, a multiyear CAGR basis, Europe has performed well, [indiscernible] digit growth. Last but not least, I will discuss China, which saw a revenue decline in the mid-single digits versus prior year. We mentioned in our last earnings call that we saw a stabilization of revenues in December and January and we called for revenues in Q3 to be similar to Q2, and that was indeed in line how the quarter played out, which is a confirmatory sign that the bottom may have been reached in China.\nWith the deceleration of revenue in China behind us, we also saw some green shoots in the region with China's State Council's [indiscernible] of a broad economic stimulus plan. This plan is focused on upgrading equipment across several industry to support innovation. While the specifics of this $70 billion lending program remain fluid, we anticipate that this will be a multiyear program that will eventually have a positive impact on our insulin business. Improving health care remains a priority for the Chinese government in our portfolios of bioactive reagents, proteomic analysis and special biology technologies will remain important tools for the modernization of health care in China.\nNow let's discuss our segments and their growth pillars, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where revenue declined [ 1 ]% year-over-year on an organic basis. This is a sequential improvement from our second quarter and reflects the stabilizing of the biopharma and Chinese end markets. Our Protein Sciences segment is where we have the most exposure to these end markets and stands to benefit the most from the green shoots taking root. Utilization of our protein simple branded portfolio of photonic analytical tools remain very strong as consumables used on those instruments continued its long streak of double-digit growth. This growth was broad-based and was prudence by the growing installed base and expanding applications of these productivity tools.\nExamples of new applications are fractionation on Maurice Flex as well as QA and QC applications for gene therapies across our platforms, such as [indiscernible] weather and Simple Black. Our Simple Western platform of automated Western blot solutions continues to gain share as demonstrated by the low double-digit growth for this quarter. The platform performance if it comes to ease of use, speed and reproducibility compares very well to manual methods, which resonates with both our biopharma and academic end users.\nCustomers continue to expand the Simple Western use case and workflows as we can see from increased utilization in gene therapy, potency and quantitative immense assay application. We are encouraged with the uptake of [indiscernible] instrument in its low mid-teens market penetration and its expanded use cases, we see a long runway for adoption of this technology. Now let's discuss the promising opportunity for a multiplex ELISA [indiscernible] branded ELA as a clinical diagnostic platform.\nFollowing this ISO 13485 certification, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on the Ella platform. This opens up a large potential end market that is highly sensitive, fast and easy to [indiscernible] immunoassay instruments. The recently announced partnership with Novo Mold DX is a great example of this opportunity. Their biomarker pathfinder, or BCID utilizes Ella, its consumables as well as Bio-Techne's reagents as the basis for their point of care of tonic test. NovomoDX will initially launch the BNP kit in India, that has potential to deploy these steps more globally in the future.\nMoving on to the performance of the next growth pillar within Protein Sciences, which is cell and gene therapy. This novel portfolio of reagents, media, analytical and workflow solutions enables our customers to further their therapeutic development to progress through clinical trials and to make continued inroads towards the commercialization of these next-generation therapies. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products and services increased over 30% in the quarter.\nGMP reagents, including GMP proteins and small molecules, remain a cornerstone of our cell therapy offering. We experienced continued traction during the quarter, especially in regenerative medicine applications. In the current quarter, we will be strengthening our GMP reagent portfolio with the launch of GMP antibodies which are designed for selection and activation in cell therapy workflows. Overall, our portfolio of GMP reagents grew over 40%, which resulted in a record revenue quarter. Now let's shift to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, which reported 10% organic growth for the quarter. Starting with our special growth pillar, which includes both our ACD business as well as our Lunaphore acquisition. The single model sensitivity unrivaled specificity and subsidiary resolution offered by the RNAi technology is driving utilization in cancer, neuroscience, immunology, cell and gene therapy and regenerative medication.\nThis broad utilization has enabled earner scope to become the most referenced spatial biology ecology in the industry as the number of our customers' publications recently surpassed 10,000. Importantly, over 50% of these publications were released in the last 3 years as increasing global awareness and expanded market adoption further up ACD's leadership in spatial biology applications. Jumping to our Lunaphore platform, demand for our fully automated hydro throughput, hyperplex spaciology platform called Comet once again outpaced our manufacturing capacity in the quarter. However, the cross-divisional projects to rapidly scale up Lunaphore's instrument production capacity is on track to meet current and future platform demand. We also remain on track to launch ACD's RNAscope HiPlex Pro on the Comet at the end of our current fiscal year. This will enable a novel, highly differentiated multiomic spatial biology platform capable of visualizing up to 12 RNA and 24 protein biomarkers simultaneously in 1 tissue sample.\nMoving on to our fourth and final growth pillar, which is the liquid biopsy-based molecular diagnostics business. Our ExoDx prostate test provides valuable information on whether a man with a gray zone PSA score should proceed with an invasive, potentially dangerous prostate biopsy or not. With over 25% volume growth in Q3, the value of this test continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. I'd also like to highlight continued traction we are experiencing with our surgeon carrier screening and oncology kit business. A surgeon's ability to solve complex molecular diagnostic challenges continue to resonate with their clinical levity partners as growth for this business approached 30% during Q3.\nAlso, we continue to execute on technology synergies within our molecular diagnostics division. We are developing exosome-based single gene mutation tests for monitoring various cancer markets. This leverage our exosome DX technology and will be distributed through our surgeon laboratory channel. We expect this first monitoring test to be launched in the upcoming quarter. Before I hand the call over to Jim to walk you through the financials in detail, I would summarize the key takeaways for Q3 as such.\nBiopharma end markets as well as the China region stabilized relative to the previous quarter, and there are early indications that these markets will improve in the back half of the calendar year. Our growth pillars, which are comprised of cell and gene therapy, proteomic analysis solutions, facial biology technology in our liquid biopsy platform will continue to outperform the market with their superior portfolio positioning and by the excellent execution of our team. These growth pillars enabled by our leading portfolio of proteomic reagents and assays remain and clearly well positioned to enable our customers to improve the quality of life by catalyzing advances in science and medicine for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim?\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThank you, Kim. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q3 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS $0.48 compared to $0.53 in the prior year quarter, with foreign exchange having a material impact on EPS. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.43 in the prior year. Q3 revenue was $303.4 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis and a 3% increase on a reported basis.\nAcquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth. Looking at our organic growth by region and end market in Q3. North America increased low single digits year-over-year, while Europe and China decreased mid-single digits. As Kim mentioned, we noticed an improvement in demand from our biopharma customers which benefited growth in both our North American and European regions. Overall, Europe had a challenging year-over-year comp as both academic and biopharma increased mid-teens last year.\nAPAC outside of China decreased low single digits overall, with government funding and macro constraints in Japan and South Korea, partially offset by growth in India. For China, the soft government fund environment continued to impact the region. Although the stabilization we experienced in our run rate business in December continued in Q3. This stabilization led to year-over-year growth in our core reagents as well as our spatial biology business in the region. It appears as though the worst of the China slowdown is behind us at this point. And over the long term, we remain content that China will still be the fastest-growing major region in the world for life science tools. However, the path back to accelerated growth, we think will take longer than previous down cycles.\nBy end market in Q3, excluding China, biopharma grew low single digits in the quarter, while academic was relatively flat with a challenging double-digit growth comps in Europe. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.9% in the quarter, a significant improvement from Q2, but lower than the 72.6% in the same quarter of the prior year. Year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition in this fiscal year.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q3 was 30.3% of revenue compared to 27.9% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q3 was 8.5% of revenue compared to 7.7% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition. Our strategic pricing strategy continues to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income, with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact on our operating margin in Q3.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q3 was 33%, a decrease of 400 basis points from the prior year period but an increase of 290 basis points sequentially. Excluding the Lunaphore acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 160 basis points lower than the prior year due to the impact of unfavorable volume leverage and to a lesser extent, strategic investments to position the business for future growth.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $3.1 million, increasing $2.9 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels associated with our acquisition of Lunaphore earlier this year. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $389 million, a decrease of $58 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf's adjusted net income and the -- for exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements.\nMoving down the P&L. Our adjusted effective rate in Q3 was 22%, flat sequentially, but up 100 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $81 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $16.4 million. Also during Q3, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with $160.5 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a strong position with approximately $140 million in cash on hand, and our total leverage ratio was below 1x EBITDA.\nGoing forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Now I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with Protein Sciences. Q3 sales were $214.6 million, with reported revenue decreasing 2% compared to the prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, following a strategic review of our portfolio, we have decided to divest the fetal bovine serum, or FBS business. FBS has approximately $10 million annual revenue business with an operating margin profile and long-term growth rate below the company average.\nThe exclusion of FBS unfavorably impacted reported segment revenue growth by 1%. Thus, organic revenue decreased 1%. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 44.2%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as unfavorable volume and product mix were partially offset by cost management and structural alignment initiatives. On a sequential basis, Protein Sciences segment operating margin increased 390 basis points as a result of these cost initiatives and improved volume leverage.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 sales were $87.5 million, with reported growth increasing 16% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth was up 10% with the Lunaphore acquisition having a 6% impact. Growth was solid across the entire segment with our Molecular Diagnostics division leading the way. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 9.3%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to the prior year's 15.2% due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition.\nHowever, Q3 operating margin improved 330 basis points sequentially from Q2, due to improving volume leverage and favorable product mix. As we close out our fiscal year, we expect our Q4 to look similar to our Q3 that just ended with markets remain stable, namely the biotech end market and the China region. Our growth pillars should continue to drive outperformance relative to the overall [indiscernible] with incremental sequential improvement in revenue. With the expectation of incremental revenue in Q4, together with our cost management actions, we should also see incremental improvement in our adjusted operating margins in Q4 relative to Q3.\nHowever, we are also facing tougher year-over-year revenue growth comps in Q4 than we did in Q3, especially in China, where we grew in the mid-teens in Q4 of last fiscal year. While these more difficult comps may be [indiscernible] to our organic growth in Q4 relative to Q3, we are pleased that the trajectory of the business is improving. As we progress to the end of our fiscal year, we will be monitoring very closely what impact the recent increases in biotech funding as well as the longer-term stimulus announced recently by the Chinese government may have in our fiscal '25 outlook and operating plans.\nAt our next earnings call, we look forward to updating you on the progress of these green shoots taking root. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. As many of you know, my official tenure as Biotechnics Chief Executive Officer ended yesterday, and Kim Kelderman is now in this leadership role. He's taking over a company that is incredibly well positioned in several of the highest growth life science and diagnostics end markets. I heard Kim lead the Diagnostics and Genomics segment in 2018, and in November of 2023, he was appointed Chief Operating Officer, assuming all operational responsibilities for the company. Prior to Bio-Techne, I worked with Kim for 4 years at Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call.

Prior to Bio-Techne, I worked with Kim for 4 years at Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nI'm excited for the future of Bio-Techne as it continues to flourish under Kim's leadership. When I joined Bio-Techne in 2013, we were a much smaller organization, with approximately $300 million in revenue at the time, the business was a leader in its legacy $3 billion total addressable market. Growth has largely stalled at the company. This legacy business of research reagents, immunoassays and diagnostic controls and calibrators, which we refer to as our core accounted for almost $650 million of revenue in fiscal 2023 and grew at a 7% CAGR over that period. Through a combination of 19 acquisitions, prioritized organic investments and execution from our top-notch leadership team, we leverage these core products and capabilities and grew the business to over $1.9 billion in fiscal 2023, while expanding our TAM to an estimated $27 billion.\nI'm excited for the future of Bio-Techne as it continues to flourish under Kim's leadership.

    "content2": "Thank you for you again, word, Chuck. And please note that all of us here of Bio-Techne the very best going forward. Now to our Q2 results. The Bio-Techne team continued to execute well in a dynamic and constrained market environment. Our industry has faced several headwinds for over a year now and all and those also impacted our second quarter, which resulted in an organic revenue decline of about 2%. The sources of these headwinds continue to be a very soft Bio-Techne funding environment destocking by our large OEM and pharma customers as well as a broad economic challenge in China, which happens to be historically our high-growth geography. Despite the negative impact from these headwinds, the long-term growth potential of our company remains intact, our strategic growth pillars such as the ProteinSimple branded portfolio of analytical tools for protein, our spatial biology franchise as well as our ExoDx liquid biopsy business all delivered solid growth during the past quarter.\nThank you for you again, word, Chuck.

We evaluated resource needs across all the businesses we analyzed relatively strategic importance as well as profitability of various product categories across our overall portfolio. As our operating margins show, Bio-Techne is already a very efficient organization. But that said, we have been able to identify opportunities to increase efficiencies throughout the global Bio-Techne operating model. In the face of the current environment, we will remain focused on driving our growth pillars while executing on those aforementioned efficiency increase opportunities.\nDuring my transition period to become CEO, I also spent time understanding the efficiencies of our global operational footprint.

Matt might be familiar name to several of you as he was formally Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Ezenta. Prior to that role, he was leading Bio-Techne's molecular diagnostics business following our acquisition of Asuragen, where he was the CEO. We are excited to have Matt back at the Bio-Techne family, given his existing knowledge of the business, strong cultural fit and breadth of life science leadership experience. He is the ideal leader to take our Diagnostics and Genomics business through the next stage of growth. Matt runs out the Bio-Techne new leadership team that has deep experience and a proven track record of driving growth through market cycles and I'm excited to lead this talented team going forward.\nBefore I proceed with the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to officially welcome Matt McManus to Bio-Techne as the President of Diagnostics and Genomics segment.

Biopharma. In biopharma, our growth declined low single digits in the quarter. As we noted in the last call, the trajectory for the global biotech sales stepped down at the end of our first quarter and into the early part of our second quarter. This trajectory continued throughout the remainder of that second quarter. The biopharma customers remain very engaged with our sales force. But given the overall funding environment, they took a much more cautious stance on spending in front of their 2024 budget cycles.\nNow let's start with a discussion on our end markets and geographies.

On the academic side, demand remains very consistent and healthy across the geographies. We drove upper single-digit growth in the quarter. And even though we saw a challenging biopharma market, the team has done an excellent job pursuing and converting opportunities in the academic market. From a geographic perspective, Europe grew mid-single digits. Our strengthened European leadership team continues the positive momentum, which we have experienced over the last 4 quarters.

You might recall that while exiting our first quarter of the fiscal year, China was highlighted as a geography where we experienced a deceleration in spend mostly impacting our portfolio within the Protein Sciences segment. These headwinds led to a year-over-year decrease of over 20% in the geography for the quarter. The good news is that following a particularly challenging October and November, the run rate stabilized as we close the calendar year, and this trend has continued at the start of calendar 2024. While it's difficult to call the bottom based on 2 months of performance, we are encouraged with the current trends stabilize. Access to improved health care remains the top priority for the China government and we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects of our product portfolio serving researchers in this region. Now let's discuss our growth pillars, starting with those within our Protein Sciences segment. A ProteinSimple branded portfolio of novel productivity-driven analytical tools had a challenging quarter when it comes to new instrument placements. This is related to the budget constraints across biopharma evident in China. However, there were a number of green shoots within that portfolio, namely the consumables used specifically on the ProteinSimple platforms.\nNow moving on to China.

Another green shoot has been our Simple Plex platform, an automated multiplexing ELISA instrument branded ELA. Overall, the platform experienced double-digit growth in Q2 as ELA is becoming the go-to platform in high-volume accounts, such as CROs and cell therapy QC labs. These accounts perform large translational studies that increasingly rely on the high sensitivity and ease of use of the platform for their multiplexing ELISA needs.\nFor the fourth quarter in a row, these consumables have grown by at least 20%, which means that our customers are utilizing our instruments at record levels even when budgets are constrained.

Overall, the platform experienced double-digit growth in Q2 as ELA is becoming the go-to platform in high-volume accounts, such as CROs and cell therapy QC labs. These accounts perform large translational studies that increasingly rely on the high sensitivity and ease of use of the platform for their multiplexing ELISA needs.\nAs a reminder, we recently received ISO 13485 certification of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility. With this important certification in hand, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on this instrumentation platform. This will open up a large potential end market for this fast highly sensitive and easy-to-use multiplexing immunoassay instrument. We are encouraged by the number of discussions we're having, the potential diagnostic partners, and we are taking steps to further position ELA as the platform of choice for high-value diagnostic application.\nAs a reminder, we recently received ISO 13485 certification of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility.

Europe increased mid-single digits, and China declined over 20% in the quarter. As Kim mentioned, the soft biotech funding environment combined with overall conservatism from our biopharma customers, we're both a drag on our North American business, and, to a lesser extent, also represented a headwind to our European performance relative to more recent quarters. APAC outside of China decreased low single digits overall, with government funding constraints in South Korea, partially offset by growth in Japan and India.\nLooking at our organic growth by region and end market in Q2 North America declined slightly year-over-year.

Encouragingly, this stabilization has continued as we begin calendar 2024. It is challenging to call the bottom in this dynamic geography that we are optimistic that headwinds going forward will be less severe. It will likely be a while before we return to the kind of growth rates that we historically achieved in China, but we remain confident that China will still be the fastest-growing major region in the world for life science tools over the long term.\nFor China, the soft government funding environment continued to impact the region.

Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 69.7% in the quarter compared to 71.7% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume leverage, unfavorable product mix and the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 31.2% of revenue compared to 27.9% in the prior year while R&D expense in Q2 was 8.4% of revenue compared to 8.3% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition, partially offset by diligent cost management across the business. The price increases implemented during fiscal year '23 continue to offset the dollar impact of inflation on operating income with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact on our operating margin in Q2. Adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 30.1%, a decrease of 540 basis points from the prior year period.

At 6%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to the prior year's 12.2%, due primarily to the impact of Bloomfor acquisition. However, Q2 operating margin improved 530 basis points sequentially from Q1 due to improving volume leverage and favorable mix. As we turn the page on Q2 and look ahead to the back half of our fiscal year, there are still reasons to remain cautious, but there are also some reasons or green shoots as can call them for optimism in the near term. On the macro front, biotech funding has not dramatically started flooding back, nor has the Chinese economy and funding the life science research returned to its pre-COVID strength. But inflation and interest rates appear to have stabilized. And according to some analyst reports, Biotech funding has already been reduced to a level not seen since 2016. Having recently bended China in Q2, Kim, Chuck and I all witnessed the local economy on the move with crowded streets and restaurants and busy regional airports. After several years of COVID shutdown, the local economy is starting to bustle once again and likely generating tax revenue for their government.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin. At 6%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to the prior year's 12.2%, due primarily to the impact of Bloomfor acquisition. However, Q2 operating margin improved 530 basis points sequentially from Q1 due to improving volume leverage and favorable mix. As we turn the page on Q2 and look ahead to the back half of our fiscal year, there are still reasons to remain cautious, but there are also some reasons or green shoots as can call them for optimism in the near term. On the macro front, biotech funding has not dramatically started flooding back, nor has the Chinese economy and funding the life science research returned to its pre-COVID strength. But inflation and interest rates appear to have stabilized. And according to some analyst reports, Biotech funding has already been reduced to a level not seen since 2016.

After several years of COVID shutdown, the local economy is starting to bustle once again and likely generating tax revenue for their government.\nAs for Bio-Techne, our growth pillars are continuing to shine even these typical macro conditions. We are closely monitoring sequential run rates in our reagents business to help determine where we are at in the [indiscernible] process. It's early in the new quarter, but thus far, we are encouraged that the worst may be behind us. This does not mean we expect a quick acceleration of growth. But we do expect that the trend of decelerating growth that has been pervasive throughout this macroeconomic cycle may have subsided. Down cycles like we've experienced over the past 18 months or so are never fun. With the resiliency of our growth pillars throughout this cycle has given us even greater confidence that our company will grow at a double-digit growth rate when markets normalize in the longer term. As our markets start to normalize, and prepare for the inevitable return to growth, we will continue to diligently manage our cost structure and invest in the business for the future. As Kim mentioned in his opening comments, we continue to identify opportunities for efficiencies and by executing on these opportunities. We'll protect and even grow our adjusted operating margin sequentially for the remainder of the fiscal year. That concludes my prepared comments.\nAs for Bio-Techne, our growth pillars are continuing to shine even these typical macro conditions.

Separately, we'll be participating in the Stifel, Stephens, Evercore and JPMorgan health care conferences in the coming months. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck.\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Bio-Techne Corp.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team continues to execute in a challenging environment as we delivered 2% organic growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 despite several headwinds that are impacting the broader industry as well as Bio-Techne. The sources of these headwinds have remained relatively consistent during recent quarters, including a soft biotech funding environment, inventory destocking from a handful of our OEM customers, as well as broad economic challenges in one of our historically highest growing geographies, China.\nWhile the primary culprits remain the same, the impact of the biopharma funding challenges in the U.S. as well as the evolving macroeconomic environment in China were higher than our original expectations for the quarter, albeit not as onerous as we saw with many of our peers. Despite these transitory challenges, our growth pillars remain intact and continue to perform well. Specifically, our GMP proteins business, ExoDx prostate and our Protein Simple franchise all delivered impressive growth in the quarter. Our portfolio remains incredibly well positioned in several high-growth and unpenetrated end markets, and our team will continue to leverage our strategic playbook and strong financial position to gain share, enter adjacent markets, introduce innovative products and solutions and capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of the company.\nBefore we dig deeper into the performance of the quarter, I'd like to personally congratulate Kim Kelderman on his recent appointment as Bio-Techne's incoming Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2024. In the meantime, I will continue to lead Bio-Techne's CEO, and work closely with Kim in his new role as Chief Operating Officer until Kim takes the reins as Bio-Techne's CEO in February. I will continue to support Kim in a senior advisory capacity prior to my retirement from the company and the Board on July 1, 2024.\nKim has successfully led the Diagnostics and Genomics segment since joining the company in 2018. During Kim's leadership of this segment, the team gained significant market acceptance and traction with the ExoDx prostate test, the revenue of our ASV business totaled the segment portfolio was strengthened through the Asuragen and Lunaphore acquisitions and multiple new product introductions and partnerships position the business for future growth. Prior to joining Bio-Techne, Kim ran multiple large businesses at ThermoFisher Scientific including most recently leading its genetic analysis business unit. Kim will be taking over an incredibly strong and talented team as well as a novel portfolio with leadership positions in some of the fastest-growing life science tools and diagnostic markets. Kim has been working with me since 2009, so I can assure everyone that I know he is more than ready for this tremendous opportunity, and he is the right person to take Bio-Techne on our 10-year forward journey to $5-plus billion revenue as a target as outlined recently at our Investor Day in New York.\nI'd like to also thank both [ Roll Gus ] and Jim Hippel, who created an incredibly difficult decision for the Board. Jim and extra thanks, as he, too, has been with me since 2009 and is the best financial partner I've ever worked with.\nSeparately, I'd like to highlight Bio-Techne's latest Corporate Sustainability Report, which showcases the continued progress the company is making in its environmental, social and governance or ESG initiatives. The report is available in the corporate and social responsibility section of Bio-Techne's website. As you will see in the report, Biotech remains committed to our employees and the communities where we live and work. We are proud of the innovative culture we have built as well as our commitment to corporate governance and operational integrity. Driving durable, sustainable and responsible growth remains a cornerstone of our forward strategy.\nNow let's get into the details of the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. Europe had a very strong quarter as the region grew mid-teens overall, including particularly strong performance from our biopharma end market. As a reminder, Europe was the region that was first experienced the effects of the post COVID slowdown, which contributed to a high single-digit decline in the comparable quarter of our last fiscal year. That said, the European biopharma and academic end markets remain stable, and the new leadership team has maintained the positive momentum we experienced in the region over the last 3 quarters.\nIn North America, we delivered as expected mid-single-digit growth with the performance in the region nearing the growth rate we experienced in the region last quarter and last fiscal year. It's worth noting that this is the region where we are noticing the most impact from the soft biotech funding environment as a subset of these customers continue to exhibit a disciplined approach to managing the businesses in the current environment.\nNow let's discuss the geography remains at the top of everyone's mind, China. This region declined low teens during the quarter and underperformed our original expectations with the business climate deteriorating as the quarter progressed. The funding challenges we highlighted in the last earnings call persisted in the quarter, as Chinese government funding for life sciences R&D at hospitals and academic institutions is significantly lower than last year. Given the challenging macroeconomic conditions in China, it remains very difficult to ascertain when R&D funding will stabilize and step back up again. Additionally, private equity and VC funding activity has slowed in the geography, which is creating more cautious near-term spending patterns for cash-dependent biopharma companies in the region.\nWe view the temporary pause in China's growth trajectory as transitory as the government remains focused on modernizing health care in both large metropolitan areas and rural communities. Our portfolio remains extremely well positioned in this geography as our proteomics research reagents and analytical tools and increasingly our spatial biology solutions are the tools researchers rely on to advance scientific discoveries and improve health care. We are as bullish as we have ever been on our long-term opportunities in China, but acknowledge that these headwinds will likely linger in the near term before improving.\nNow I'll highlight the growth pillars that will propel our future, starting with [indiscernible] within the Protein Sciences segment, where organic growth was 2% in the current quarter. During the quarter, we continued to advance our portfolio of cell and gene therapy initiatives as our portfolio of proteomics reagents and workflow solutions continue to enable our customers to further their therapeutic development work and make continued progress towards the commercialization of these next-generation therapies. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products and services increased over 25% in the quarter.\nGMP proteins remains the cornerstone of our cell therapy offering and Bio-Techne continues to benefit from having the broadest menu available, including several proteins that are unique to Bio-Techne. This broad offering is a critical selling point for customers working across the cell therapy spectrum especially in regenerative medicine cell therapies as these tend to require not only several different proteins in the workflow, but also require complex proteins that are very difficult to manufacture, playing right into one of biotech strong suits.\nOverall, our portfolio of GMP proteins grew nearly 40% in the quarter. We also continue to gain traction with our portfolio of GMP small molecules. Recall that these small molecules are key components in the route programming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to regenerative medicine workflows. This business grew almost 20% in the quarter and is on its way to becoming a significant contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy business.\nWe are in the process of expanding our G&P portfolio to include additional media formulations, gene edit engineering capabilities and antibodies, positioning Bio-Techne to remain a leader in this rapidly growing industry. Additionally, work continues to finalize our aseptic immune cell therapy manufacturing solution, which pairs our GMP proteins, GMP Media and Wilson Wolf GRx in a closed sterile manufacturing solution.\nMoving on to our ProteinSimple branded portfolio or proteomic analytical tools. Here, the team delivered 9% organic growth. It's worth noting that excluding China, the portfolio grew an even more impressive 18%, including over 35% growth in Europe. Consumable pull-through from our growing installed base remains very strong and continues to grow on a per instrument basis, reflecting the high value and productivity gains that these instruments deliver to our biopharma and academic customers. The ProteinSimple performance was led by our Simple Plex automated multiplexing ELISA instrument branded as Ella, who is expanding menu of validated assays, including 7 launches in Q1 and a growing installed base is driving consumable pull-through on the platform. We've recently received ISO 1345 certification of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility quality management system, demonstrating our commitment to producing products for clinical applications. With this important certification in hand, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on Ella, opening up a large potential market for this fast, highly sensitive and easy-to-use multiplexing immunoassay instruments.\nMomentum continued in our Biologics business as we experienced continued uptake of our Maurice Flex instrument and strong demand for consumables. As a reminder, Maurice Flex's protein charge variant fractionation capabilities position this next-gen instrument is an easy-to-use replacement for legacy mass spectromaty fractionation, methods, including ion exchange chromatography. This new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market approximately doubling the addressable market opportunity for the instrument. The capabilities of our legacy Maurice instrument as well as the next-gen Maurice Flex were recently highlighted by scientists from top pharmaceutical companies at the recent CE Farm conference, including a presentation from Pfizer scientists on Maurice Flex's capabilities for peak identification of AAV capsid proteins through fractionation.\nI would note that there are several other Maurice Flex collaborations in progress with additional top-tier life science companies. Our fully automated Western [ blot ] solution branded as Simple Western also continued to increase its market share this quarter. The platform's ability to reduce the 2-day long manual and messy western blotting process into a 3-hour push button, highly reproducible solution continues to drive demand within our biopharma and academic customer bases. We are also seeing robust adoption of Simple Western in cell and gene therapy applications with the system increasingly being utilized to measure protein expression potency, empty versus full capsid ratio, and for process impurity detection.\nRevenue from cell and gene therapy applications in Simple Western increased over 25% in the quarter and now account for almost 1/4 of the associated product right of revenue.\nNext, I'll highlight the growth [indiscernible] in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue growth was flat in the current quarter compared to prior year. Mostly due to the timing of large OEM orders within our diagnostics reagents business as well as large lab orders for genetic tests within our molecular diagnostic business. I'll start with our ExoDx prostate test, where we once again drove significant growth in test volume as the valuable information on whether a man with an indeterminate PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. ExoDx prostate volume increased nearly 50% compared to prior quarter, while year quarter, while revenue increased in the upper teens. Adjusting for our prior year cash to accrual adjustment, year-over-year revenue growth was approximately in line with our test volume growth.\nAs we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, applications for our exosome-based diagnostic platform are much broader than our current ExoDx prostate test. Our pipeline includes single gene mutation test for monitoring several different cancers, a saliva-based test for the diagnosis of children syndrome a next-generation prostate cancer rule in test as well as a colorectal cancer screening test designed for early detection of both colorectal cancer and precancerous polyps. We look forward to sharing additional data on this exciting pipeline in coming quarters.\nNow let's discuss our spatial biology business, which includes our ACD-branded catalog of over 47,000 unique probes as well as the Luna for branded spatial biology instrument assay and software portfolio. Our spatial biology business increased upper single digits organically for the quarter as our broad portfolio of multi-omic assays continue to play an important role in advancing gene therapy, neuroscience and cancer research. Within the portfolio, we are experiencing continued momentum in base scope, which enables the detection of target sequences down to one nucleotide differences and microRNA scope for the visualization of microRNA and other nucleic acid targets. BaseScope and micro RNA scope increased almost 20% and 50%, respectively, and are experiencing increasing acceptance and traction in gene therapy applications.\nIntegration efforts of our latest acquisition, Lunaphore, are off to a great start and the team is embracing their new home under the biotech umbrella. As a reminder, Lunaphore for is currently commercializing its common instrument, a fully automated, high-throughput Hyperflex platform that does not require the use of conjugated primary antibodies. [indiscernible] high value proposition is resonating with the translational research community, which is driving significant interest and rapid growth in its installed base. We continue to make progress developing the first fully automated spatial and multiomic workflow that will leverage Lunaphore's common instruments, Inspire antibody panels as well as ACD's RNAscope Hipple technology to enable protein and RNA detection and visualization on a single slide.\nIn summary, the Bio-Techne team continues to execute our strategic growth plan in this challenging environment. As we look at our relative performance to many of the life science companies that have reported so far this quarter, I'm especially proud of our team's execution and have even more confidence in the perseverance of our growth platforms. As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our portfolio of proteomic research reagents, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, analytical tools, spatial biology products and liquid biopsy diagnostics are aimed squarely at a $27 billion vessel market with amazing long-term growth prospects. Initiatives to cure cancer, neurodegenerative and other diseases, along with understanding how these diseases develop and evolve, we remain a social priority for the foreseeable future, and Bio-Techne's portfolio will continue to play a critical role in these efforts. I am looking forward to when the transitory headwinds facing our industry subside, allowing the growth of our high-value tools to once again shine through.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, then give some thoughts on the financial outlook.\nStarting with the overall first quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.45 in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 9% over last year. Foreign exchange had a had an immaterial impact on EPS in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.55 in the prior year. Q1 revenue was $276.9 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis and 3% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had an immaterial impact, while acquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth.\nMoving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q1. North America grew mid-single digits. Europe increased mid-teens, and China declined low teens in the quarter. As Chuck previously mentioned, the soft biotech funding environment remained a drag on our North American business, while Europe saw strong growth but also had a less difficult comp as the region declined high single digits in the comparable quarter last year.\nFor China, the funding environment continued to impact the region. Our long-term enthusiasm on China remains fully intact. Health care remains a top priority for the government and our proteomic reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions will play a critical role advancing health care in this country. That said, the timing of this recovery remains incrementally more challenging to call at this point. Meanwhile, APAC outside of China increased low single digits overall, with government funding constraints in Japan and South Korea.\nBy end market in Q1, both biopharma and academia excluding China, grew upper single digits. However, the biopharma growth was much larger in Europe given the less difficult comps. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.3% in the quarter compared to 70.9% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by productivity gains and foreign exchange partially offset by the impact of the [indiscernible] acquisition. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 31.3% of revenue compared to 27.3% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q1 was 8.7% of revenue compared to 8.9% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments to position the business for future growth. The price increases implemented during the first half of fiscal year '23 continue to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact in our operating margin in Q1.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q1 was 31.4%, a decrease of 340 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the Lunaphore acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 100 basis points lower than the prior year due to strategic investments, which was partially offset by diligent cost management.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $3.9 million, increasing $1 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels, partially offset by higher interest income and cash deposits. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $440 million, an increase of $90 million compared to last quarter, reflecting the Lunaphore acquisition, which was partially funded by debt and cash on hand.\nOther adjusted nonoperating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.4 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf's adjusted net income partially offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 22%, a sequential increase from our Q4 tax rate due to international mix.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $59.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $13.6 million. Also during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.7 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 161.9 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a strong position with $148.7 million in cash, and our total leverage ratio remained below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation.\nBefore we get into the segment results, I'd like to quantify some of the impacts from headwinds we experienced in the quarter compared to our initial expectations for organic growth. A more challenging China funding and macro environment than expected represented an additional approximately 200 basis points headwind, while order timing in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment was another unanticipated headwind of approximately 100 basis points. The more cautious spending from our biotech customers, which we primarily experienced in the U.S. is more difficult to quantify that impacted the business none the less, especially in the last couple of weeks of the quarter.\nNow I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with Protein Sciences. Q1 reported sales were $204.7 million, with both reported and organic revenue increasing 2% compared to the same period last year. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.2%, and an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as productivity gains and cost management more than offset the impact from strategic investments.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $72.8 million, with reported growth increasing 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the [ summit ] was flat with acquisitions having a 3% impact and foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 1%. As Chuck previously mentioned, organic growth was negatively impacted by the timing of certain OEM and lab orders for our diagnostic controls and genetic testing products. However, our Exosome Diagnostics business remained very strong in the quarter as our fortified marketing message, strong clinical data and the updated Medicare LCD drove both test volume and revenue growth. Also, our spatial biology business delivered upper single-digit growth in the quarter with continued growth in RNA scope and strong performances in our BaseScope and microRNA product lines.\nWe are very pleased with the traction Lunaphore is having with its comment launch, as Chuck highlighted initial integration efforts are progressing well. While Lunaphore will not be in our organic growth rates for the year, they are executing well on their plan to grow more than 100% for the fiscal year. We continue to expect Lunaphore to contribute at least 1.5% to our overall company's reported growth for fiscal '24.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 0.7%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to prior year's 12.4%, due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition, and to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable product mix.\nBefore we get to Q&A, I'd like to provide some color on our current thoughts regarding the near-term outlook. As many of our life science tools peers have already mentioned, the macro environment in China continues to weaken, and the biopharma end market is softening, especially in the U.S. While we expect these headwinds to negatively impact our growth in the protein scientist segment relative to Q1, we also anticipate the timing of OEM and lab orders within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment to be accretive to growth relative to Q1. Net-net, we are forecasting overall company organic growth to be about flat in Q2.\nBeyond Q2, the macro environment is dynamic to provide guidance with any sort of results. While the headwinds of OEM destocking should be behind us in the second half of fiscal year '24, it appears right now that a China and biopharma recovery will not be tailwind as we once believed. Whatever the macro environment throws at us in the near term, our excellent management team and dedicated employees will continue to drive productivity to protect the bottom line, all while selectively investing in the growth pillars that will accelerate our overall company's growth rate when the market headwinds decide and turn back into tailwinds, and the winds will turn. As Chuck said, society's priority to cure disease is inevitable and endless. Bio-Techne is ready now and will be even more so in the future to help our customers fulfill the societal need.\nThat concludes my prepared comments and with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck.\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Bio-Techne Corp.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter Conference call. We finished our fiscal 2023 largely as expected with 5% fourth quarter organic growth nearing the growth we delivered for full fiscal 2023 and capped a year where we successfully navigated a transitory macroeconomic environment. I'm extremely proud of the team's ability to deliver this growth in the face of transitory headwinds, which we refer to as the COVID hangover that we faced for the majority of this past fiscal year.\nThese post-COVID induced headwinds included a softer biotech funding environment, inventory destocking from a subset of our OEM customers and macroeconomic challenges in China. Despite these challenges, the endurance of our key growth platforms was demonstrated yet again in Q4 and double-digit growth in our ProteinSimple branded instrument portfolio, spatial biology ACD platform, cell and gene therapy Workforce Solutions, and our liquid biopsy exosome platform.\nNow let's get into the details a bit, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. In North America, we grew mid-single digits for both the quarter and the fiscal year. This may appear underwhelming. However, keep in mind that North America grew over 20% for the quarter and full year in fiscal '22 driven by our biopharma end markets that was on fire with over 30% growth. With that kind of comp, as you can imagine, North America faced the greatest headwind from lower biotech funding this year. Europe had a great quarter to end the year with low double-digit growth in Q4, finishing the year with growth in the high single digits. This was on top of a comp from last year that was also incredibly strong with growth in the mid-teens for both Q4 and full year fiscal '22.\nNow for the region that is on everyone's minds, China. China is a region that has faced the most volatility throughout COVID and even now during the COVID hangover, you will recall during our third quarter conference call, we talked about how we saw our business in China come roaring back once everyone there was recovered from the COVID illness and back to work after the Chinese New Year. That strength continued through the first half of Q4 then abruptly stalled when the annual funding of new programs from the Chinese government did not occur as it usually does during the April, May time frame.\nDespite this delay in funding our team in China was still able to execute extremely well and delivered growth in the mid-teens for Q4. However, at this moment, it is still unclear when government funding of new programs in life sciences will resume. History suggests however, they won't be long. And when it returned, we expect the growth to be robust. While COVID and its aftermath have been extremely disruptive to business in China, it has only strengthened the long-term thesis that the pursuit of better healthcare in China will continue to be a top national priority. We are positioned extremely well with our differentiated portfolio to enable China in their pursuit. In the meantime, we will continue to serve our customers in China by providing them the tools to make their research as productive as possible with the funds they have.\nNow let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where we grew 4% in both the quarter and the fiscal year. This growth was delivered on a particularly challenging comparison for both the quarter and fiscal year, where we grew 16% and 19% in the prior year periods, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, we advanced our cell and gene therapy initiatives as our reagents, media and analytical workflow solutions continue to aid our customers' progress on therapy, development and clinical trials. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products grew almost 30% in Q4 and are positioned to remain a key growth driver going forward. This strong performance puts an exclamation point on a year where despite a soft biotech funding environment, our cell and gene therapy business increased over 20% for the full year.\nFor GMP proteins, we continue to offer the broadest menu in the market including GMP proteins for immuno-oncology therapies as well as an industry-leading portfolio for regenerative medicine applications. These proteins are manufactured with a high level of bioactivity, lot-to-lot consistency and period has become synonymous with our R&D Systems brand of reagents. This unique offering and our reputation as the highest quality producer drove Q4 growth of almost 60% and our third consecutive quarter of record GMP protein revenue. It's worth noting that over 400 cell therapy accounts have used our GMP proteins to date, over 20% more accounts than in the prior year. Additionally, we are in the very early stages of realizing the large cross-selling opportunities that exist within our GMP protein customer base and the broader Bio-Techne portfolio and has strategies in place to drive adoption of RUO reagents, immunoassays, cell culture products, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions throughout these accounts.\nFactoring in our pending Wilson Wolf acquisition and their roster of approximately 800 customers that we have access to via scale ready, this immense cross-selling opportunity becomes even larger. Our GMP portfolio is not unique to just proteins as we also offer GMP versions of several reagents within our small molecule portfolio. As a reminder, our small molecules are critical ingredients for cell reprogramming, expansion and differentiation, which represent critical stages in regenerative medicine workflows. High demand for our portfolio of GMP small molecules drove growth of over 250% in the quarter, and we are adding capacity to meet current and anticipated demand for these key bioactive reagents. There are other areas of our vast portfolio of reagents and media that are ripe for GMP offerings, including antibodies, and we will continue to develop and commercialize products to meet growing demand for these key products going forward.\nMoving on to our catalog of RUO or research use only reagents, which includes over 6,000 proteins and 400,000 antibody types. As a reminder, researchers rely on these reagents as key inputs for their experiments as these consumable products enable critical functions within the lab, including cell growth and differentiation, disease monitoring, cell imaging, immunoassays, immunohistochemistry, western blots and other foundational research functions. The majority of our RUO reagent business is run rate, where researchers order proteins, antibodies and small molecules as needed for their ongoing research. These reagents also serve as content for a handful of OEM customers where they purchase our reagents frequently, antibodies as a key component of their end products, which in turn generate royalties for Bio-Techne.\nAs predicted, we expect that a destocking effect again in Q4 with a handful of these OEM customers as they work their way through excess inventory, stocked out of caution during the COVID induced industry supply chain crunch. We expect this destocking dynamic to gradually wind down over the next 6 months before normal ordering patterns resume for these customers in the back half of our fiscal '24.\nDuring the quarter, we announced that we prevailed on a claim that one of our competitors, Multani Biosciences, commercialized antibodies that is obtained by reverse engineering 2 of Bio-Techne's proprietary R&D Systems branded antibodies. Bio-Techne take great pride in the fact that our proprietary products are the result of our own internally developed intellectual property. We have a long history of selectively sharing our intellectual property with academic and biopharma partners through licensing arrangements but will vigorously defend our position against any unlawful use of our proprietary discoveries.\nContinuing with the Protein Sciences segment, let's discuss the performance of our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of instruments and consumables where we delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter. The Q4 performance was led by nearly 20% growth in our fully automated western blot solution branded as Simple Western. The platform's ability to reduce the 2-day long annual [indiscernible] western blotting process into a 3-hour push button, highly reproducible solution continues to drive demand within our biopharma and academic customer bases. We are also seeing robust adoption of Simple Western and gene therapy applications with the system increasingly being utilized to measure protein expression potency, empty versus full capsid ratio and to detect process impurities.\nOur Biologics business increased upper single digits for the quarter on top of a comp of nearly 40% growth last year as we experienced strong demand and initial sales of our MauriceFlex instrument. As a reminder, MauriceFlex as protein charge variant fractionation capabilities to Maurice's legacy protein identity, charge and purity capabilities, fractionation of the front-end step to mass spectrometry and MauriceFlex resolves the labor-intensive and time-consuming challenges of using legacy fractionation methods, including ion-exchange photography. This new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market, approximately doubling the addressable market opportunity for the instrument. We are very encouraged by the strong and [indiscernible] to this exciting new instrument.\nFor our Simple Plex automated multiplexing live instrument branded as Ella, we continue to build the [ immunoassays ], launching 36 validated Simple Plex assays on the platform during fiscal 2023 including 4 AAV titer assays for gene therapy and 5 neuroscience markets. Going forward, neuroscience and cell and gene therapy represent large opportunities for Ella and both remain a focus of application development and menu expansion initiatives. During the quarter, we also made significant progress positioning Ella as a clinical diagnostics platform as we successfully completed the ISO 1345 audit of our [indiscernible] facility and are waiting to hear back on the results. With this certification in hand, we will be ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities opening a large potential end market for this highly sensitive, easy-to-use and vast multiplexing immunoassay instruments.\nNow let's discuss our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue increased 10% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. I'll start with our Molecular Diagnostics business, where we once again drove significant growth in our ExoDx prostate test as the valuable information on whether a man with an indeterminate PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. ExoDx prostate volume and associated revenue both increased nearly 7% compared to the prior year quarter capping a breakout year for the test where volume increased by over 70%, revenue increased over 90%, and we surpassed 100,000 ExoDx test performed to date.\nThe value of our ExoDx prostate test was further solidified with the recent publication in the prostate cancer and Prostatic Diseases journal of interim results from a randomized study of over 1,000 patients designed to show the clinical utility of the test. In the study, patients identified as low risk by the ExoDx prostate test received fewer biopsies, significantly deferred the time to their first biopsy, and we're significantly less likely to be diagnosed in the future with high-grade prostate cancer. The growing acceptance of the test, strong clinical utility data, a Medicare local coverage decision is now reflective of the NCCN guidelines and includes reimbursement for repeat annual testing as well as a fortified sales force and market accessing positioned fiscal '24 to be another record year for our ExoDx prostate test.\nNow let's discuss our Spatial Biology franchise, which includes our [ ACD branded ] portfolio of more than 45,000 probes in over 400 species that enable biomarker imaging at single molecule sensitivity in single cell resolution. Our spatial biology business increased low double digits in both Q4 and the fiscal year. The growing interest and utilization of our ACD technology as the go-to technology for translational spatial biology research applications is apparent in the growing number of publications citing the technology which increased over 10% during the first half of calendar 2023 and now total over 8,000.\nWithin the portfolio, we are experiencing continued momentum in BaseScope, which enables the detection of short RNA target sequences and microRNA scope, which allows for the visualization of ASO, microRNA and [indiscernible] and other nucleic acid targets. As these highly sensitive and specific assays increased over 20% and 30%, respectively, in Q4. Following the robust growth for both the quarter and the fiscal year, BaseScope and microRNA scope are both becoming increasingly more spatial to our overall spatial biology franchise.\nSeparately, we furthered this partnering strategy for our gold standard RNAscope technology with the release of an RNAscope [indiscernible] workflow for the standard BioTools Hyperion Imaging System. We also expanded our growing arsenal of ASR probes with the launch of RNAscope pros for Kappa and Lambda as Analyte Specific Reagents or ASRs. Kappa and Lambda are important oncology biomarkers for B-cell lymphomas and these ASRs will enable CLIA labs to develop customized tests while maintaining high standards of analytical and clinical performance.\nFinally, I'd like to officially welcome the Lunaphore team to Bio-Techne. As a reminder, we recently closed the Lunaphore acquisition, which is the 18th acquisition our team has closed during my tenure as CEO. This acquisition strengthens our spatial biology franchise while adding a talented group of innovators to the company. Our strong track record of identifying state-of-the-art platforms and technologies on the cusp [indiscernible] significant market uptake and growth like Lunaphore has been a key driver of our double-digit revenue and total stock return CAGR, over the last 10 years.\nThis acquisition builds off a partnership we announced with Lunaphore earlier this year, while the 2 companies partnered to develop the first fully automated multiomic spatial biology platform. This novel offering will be capable of simultaneously interrogating protein and RNA expression at a single cell revolution using a fully automated same slide workflow. Pairing Lunaphore's COMET instrument inspire antibody panels with our legacy RNAscope HiPlex technology. COMET is early in its initial commercialization, but the systems end-to-end capabilities that fully automate staining, imaging and image preprocessing steps, use of conjugated antibodies and high throughput design is generating significant interest, market traction and placements.\nIn summary, Q4 concludes the fiscal year where the team successfully navigated several challenges facing the company and the broader life sciences tool industry. While the short-term macro challenges are not over, we are encouraged that they will gradually diminish in the year ahead. Starting with the less challenging comps from the COVID halo days, less destocking by our OEM customers from the COVID hangover days and a more stable biotech funding environment going forward. While Q4 was a good quarter for us in China, the funding environment in China will likely be a big challenge for at least the first half of the year. But don't doubt China's resolved for better healthcare, and we believe when the funding returns, it will come back strong.\nAs this past year has proven, our stable of growth platforms can persevere in good times as well as challenging ones. We will continue to prioritize and focus our execution on these growth platforms which propelled this company to accelerated growth and profitability in the years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q4 and fiscal 2023 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the year ahead.\nStarting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.51 in the prior year quarter, an increase of 8% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.01 or minus 2% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $301.3 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on both organic and reported basis. For the full fiscal year 2023, revenue was over $1.1 billion, an increase of 3% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 2% and acquisitions had an immaterial impact on our full fiscal year revenue growth.\nMoving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q4. North America grew mid-single digits, Europe increased low double digits and China grew mid-teens in the quarter. As Chuck already mentioned, the growth in North America and Europe was on top of very high comps from the prior year when they were experiencing what we now refer to as the COVID halo effect. China was more volatile as it has been all year, a very strong first half of the quarter, followed by a rather weak half. Nonetheless, the mid-teens growth rate we delivered in China appears to be one of the best results among our life science tool company peers and speaks to the overall resiliency and value that our bioactive reagents, analytic tools and spatial biology solutions delivered to our customers in the region.\nAPAC outside of China declined low single-digits overall with similar COVID hangover induced challenges as China in several countries in the region. By end market in Q4, biopharma grew mid-single digits on top of very tough comps in the prior year while academia grew upper single digits.\nSimilar to our Q3 destocking by a handful of our Protein Sciences OEM licensing and supply customers negatively impacted overall company revenue growth by approximately 2%. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.6% in the quarter compared to 73.2% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q4 was 26.8% of revenue compared to 27.8% in the prior year while R&D expense in Q4 was 7.8% of revenue compared to 8.1% in the prior year. The decrease in relative SG&A and R&D was driven by operational efficiencies and diligent expense management which was partially offset by ongoing strategic growth investments. The business has implemented strategic price increases during the first half of fiscal year '23 to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income with pricing also largely offsetting the inflation impact on our operating margin in Q4.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q4 was 37.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year period, but a 10 basis point improvement sequentially. Excluding Namocell acquisition from earlier this fiscal year, adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points higher than the prior year due diligent cost management and prioritization.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $2.5 million, increasing $0.3 million compared to the prior year due to higher debt levels partially offset by higher interest income earned on cash deposits. Our bank debt on balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $350 million, a decrease of $20 million compared to last quarter. I would note, we closed the Lunaphore acquisition at the beginning of this current fiscal year, which was partially funded by debt and cash on hand. We anticipate our net interest expense to increase sequentially to approximately $4.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '24. Other adjusted net operating expense was $0.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the prior year. Primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf adjusted net income, which amounted to $1.7 million in the quarter, more than offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements.\nMoving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.2%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $83.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.8 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 161.9 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a strong position with $204.3 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments, and our total leverage ratio remained well below 1x TTM EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $223 million with reported revenue increasing 3% compared to the same period last year. Organic growth for this segment was 4%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 1%. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to biotech funding considerations, the OEM destocking that has occurred among our licensing and commercial supply customers as well as to the China geographic region. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 44.7%, a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year driven by the impact of the Namocell acquisition.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q4 reported sales were $79 million with reported and organic revenue both increasing 10%. Our Exosome Diagnostics business remained very strong in the quarter, as our fortified marketing message, strong clinical data, strengthened commercial team and the recently updated Medicare LCD drove test volume and revenue growth. Also, our spatial biology business delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter with strong performances in our RNAscope, BaseScope and microRNA product lines. As Chuck highlighted earlier, we are very excited about our recent acquisition of Lunaphore and expect it will add at least 1.5% to the company's reported growth in fiscal year '24, with a stand-alone growth rate over 100%.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Operating margin at 18.5%, the segment's operating margin increased 280 basis points compared to the prior year. The segment's operating margin was favorably impacted by volume leverage.\nBefore we get to Q&A, I will summarize our fiscal year '23 and how it shapes our view for the upcoming fiscal '24 as follows. We view fiscal '23 as the year of the COVID hangover, which followed 2 extremely strong years that we refer to as the COVID halo. This hangover included a more risk-off mentality for smaller biotech investing, government-induced shutdown in our highest growth region, that be in China and destocking of excessive inventories that took place during the COVID induced supply chain crunch. Through it all, and as Q4 demonstrated, our growth platforms are still winning with double-digit growth.\nNow the question on everyone's mind is will the COVID hangover last as long as the COVID halo did? Well, as with everyone else, we don't have a crystal ball that gives us that answer. What we do see is that biotech spending has stabilized. Therefore, we are hopeful that going into fiscal year '24, this headwind we faced in fiscal year '23 is diminished. However, we haven't noticed any meaningful increases in biotech funding that would suggest this becomes a tailwind anytime soon. We do estimate that destocking from our OEM licensing and commercial supply customers will unwind by the end of this calendar year and should become a tailwind in calendar year '24 as buying from these customers resume.\nAs Chuck described earlier, China took a surprising and suddenly reversal in revenue trajectory halfway through the most recent fourth quarter than the usual annual cycle of renewed government funding did not occur. Until funding of life sciences by the Chinese government returns, tools companies like us will see continued headwinds in this region. When will government funding Life Sciences return in China is anyone's guess. But given China's history and publicly stated importance of life sciences to their sovereign strategy, we expect that the funding will return sooner rather than later, and when it does, it will be strong.\nSo what does this all potentially mean for our fiscal year '24? Well, we believe it means that we will need to grow primarily by gaining wallet share in this cautionary financial environment just as we did for the entirety of fiscal year '23. We will continue to do this by selectively investing and promoting our long-term growth platforms, namely cell and gene therapy, liquid biopsy, spatial biology and our analytical instrument platforms. Thus, we expect our organic revenue growth in the first half of fiscal year '24 to be similar to our organic growth in fiscal year '23. With regards to the back half of our fiscal year, there is a path to accelerating growth rates in OEM purchasing returns and if China government funding of life sciences occurs before the next Chinese New Year.\nAs we look to adjusted operating margins for the year ahead, we estimate they will be down approximately 300 basis points from fiscal year '23, mostly driven by our acquisition of Lunaphore and, to a lesser extent, due to continued selective investment in our key growth platforms as well as our overall customer digital experience. These investments, together with the acquisition of Lunaphore will ensure that we stay on track of our long-term growth goals as macro conditions improve. Margins can improve slightly from this base case depending on if and by how much revenue growth rates improved in the second half of the year.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to David Clair. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations & Corporate Development\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results.\nThe company's 10-K for fiscal year 2022 identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section.\nDuring the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be participating in the BofA, RBC Capital Markets, Benchmark, Craig Hallum and Jefferies Healthcare Conferences in May and June. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck..\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Bio-Techne Corp.\n\nThank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. As we expected, message in last quarter's call, our Q3 top line year-on-year revenue growth was similar to the growth we reported in Q2. While the year-on-year growth rate and tough comps from last year were similar in both quarters, the underlying performance of the business improved quarter-on-quarter when considering the large exit though key milestone payment received from [ DuraFisher ] last year in Q3. The team did a great job this quarter, furthering several of our key growth drivers as physician uptake and utilization of our ExoDx prostate test accelerated demand for our cell therapy workflow solutions, including GMP proteins remains strong, and our spatial biology business returned to double-digit growth.\nThese growth drivers were partially offset by the continued challenges of COVID in China, lower biotech funding and OEM destocking from supply chain disruption concerns last year. Encouragingly, as we look ahead to finishing this fiscal year and kicking off fiscal year '24, we see China coming back strong. With COVID now in the rearview mirror, destocking by our OEM customers eventually with unwinding and moving beyond the tough prior year comps from our smaller biotech customers.\nBefore I get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Peter Schuster as the new leader of our European organization and business. Peter has over 20 years of experience leading commercial organizations, including very relevant experience, successfully growing businesses and leading European-based teams in large life science tools companies. Under Peter's leadership, we are looking forward to continuing to grow our European presence and delivering the tools the region relies on to enable scientific discoveries.\nNow an overview of our performance by geography and end market. Starting with Europe, where the team delivered high single-digit growth -- order growth in the quarter than the macro environment continued to stabilize and overall research activity increased sequentially within our core biopharma and academic end markets. Our new Dublin warehouse to support Mainland Europe is now fully functional and fulfilling customer orders. With a new leader in place, a new distribution center and an improved ERP system, we are positioned to serve our customers even better in the region. In North America, we also saw sequential improvement with order growth increasing mid-single digits in the quarter.\nHere, the impact of a lower biotech spend is the greatest and the year-on-year comp is the toughest with over 25% growth in Volpara last year. And finally, there is China, which was a tale of 2 chapters this quarter. Prior to the Lunar New Year, most people in China were still recovering from COVID and citizens were directed by the government who essentially stay home until after the New Year holiday. Up until this point in the quarter, sales were practically nonexistent in China. But after everyone -- everyone was well and came back from holiday, sales accelerated dramatically, and our China team was able to finish the quarter with revenue growth in low single digits.\nThis was on top of a comp where China grew with 30% last year, just through a remarkable effort by our team in China. With COVID now in the rearview mirror for China, we hope for good, we see China's growth continuing to accelerate from here, perhaps to more than 40% growth next quarter. Now let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where organic revenue increased 5% for the quarter on top of a strong comp from last year when the segment grew 16%. During the quarter, we continued to make progress with our portfolio of cell therapy workflow solutions, including our GMP reagents, specialty cell culture media, along with cell culture agencies and DME, which collectively grew over 20% in our Q3.\nOur GMP proteins remain in high demand across cell therapy spectrum as biopharma customers developing products for the regenerative medicine and immune cell therapy markets continue to rely on our portfolio over 40 GMP-grade cytokines and growth factors, including several that are only available from Bio-Techne to effectively scale their therapies. Our GMP protein business had its second conceive record rating quarter, and given our industry-leading menu of highly bioactive lotto consistent and peer GMP proteins, we are positioned to remain a leader in this rapidly growing market.\nIn addition to the ongoing progress of expanding the GMP proteins venue, we are manufacturing in our state-of-the-art same fall facility. We are also experiencing significant yield improvements to scale production at this facility. Recall, we originally estimated GMP protein capacity at the facility was $140 million annually, which we increased to over $200 million as we manufactured initial protein batches from this new facility. As the team continues to launch additional GMP proteins, we have been able to achieve product yields as much as 50x higher compared to legacy methods used to manufacture smaller batches in our headquarters.\nIn fact, these productivity and yield gains have been so significant that we now estimate capacity of this facility is at least $500 million and potentially higher than $1 billion, depending on the mix of GMP proteins ultimately manufactured from the facility. We also reached a significant milestone in our cell therapy strategy in Q3 with our initial investment in to Wilson Wolf. As a reminder, Wilson Wolf is a manufacturer of the proprietary line of cell production bioreactor called GRx, which provide an ideal amount of oxygen and nutrients to effectively scale immune cell therapies. Wilson Wolf and Fresenius Kabi, both have been key partners of our Bio-Techne through the scale-ready commercial joint venture since 2020.\nWith the 3 companies collectively offering tools and technologies for cell culture, cell activation, gene editing and cell processing. During the quarter, Wilson Wolf reached its trailing 12-month EBITDA milestone triggering Biotech's $257 million investment for a 20% ownership stake into Wilson Wolf. We see tremendous synergies with the eventual ownership of Wilson Wolf and are already developing a one-of-a-kind standardized, closed non-gene therapy manufacturing system that integrates GRE biotech GenPproteins and T cell culture media into an FDA-compliant patient-ready off-the-shelf production process that will save end users significant time and money as they pursue meaningful clinical data and eventual commercialization of these novel cell therapies.\nFollowing this initial investment, Bio-Techne has the right to acquire the remainder of Wilson Wolf for $1 billion upon its achievement of additional milestones or for 4.4x trailing 12-month revenue if these milestone not achieved by December 31, 2027. We look forward to continuing near-term pipeline development work for Wilson Wolf and eventually having this rapidly growing, highly profitable industry standards under biotechs growing umbrella of cell therapy product.\nNow let's discuss our portfolio proteomic research reagents, including our RUO proteins, antibodies and small molecules, which collectively grew single digit low single digit in the quarter coming off of a challenging year-over-year comp, where we grew about 20% in Q3 of last year. I'd like to elaborate on the OEM phenomenon we've experienced in our year-over-year comps for the past couple of quarters.\nRecall that a year ago, supply chains were constrained and several companies, including Bio-Techne stocked up on certain components that are critical to meeting customer demand. Bio-Techne has an industry-leading catalog of over 6,000 proteins and over 425,000 different antibody types the researchers around the globe rely on as the basis of the research, enabling scientific discoveries, enabling new therapeutic and diagnostic discoveries to further health care.\nThis same catalog of bioactive reagents also serves as the enabling content for several products from other diagnostic and life science tools companies. Without this content, a number of their [ asses ] will not work. Last fiscal year, a handful of these OEM customers stocked our reagents to ensure their ability to continue to meet demand for their products. Best we can tell right now, it will take another quarter or 2 before this destocking to unwind. After that, these headwinds should become tailwinds as these OEM customers run their normal ordering patterns of our reagents in fiscal '24. Moving on to the performance of our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of analytical solutions -- we delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter as all 3 of our primary instrument platforms increased in the quarter.\nThe rapid installed base growth we experienced over the last 2 years continues to drive increased consumable utilization across our ProteinSimple instrument platform at our Simple Western, SimplePlex and Maurice instruments become more ingrained in research workflows. To ease -- the ease of use and flexibility offered by our proteomic and analytical tools are leading to expanding applications across the 3 platforms. These expanding applications, particularly for cell and gene therapy, QA and QC is translating into higher total addressable market opportunities for these platforms as our legacy proteomechanical tools, TAM expands from $2 billion to $3 billion to firmly above $3 billion.\nOrder funnels remain very strong across the 3 entry platforms, although budget conservatism from a subset of biotech end users has led to an overall lengthening of the order closing cycle. Our Simple Plex branded multiplexing immunoacid platform, Ella, led instrument growth increasing by 25% in the quarter. the sub-team sensitivity and cost advantages offered by this fully automated ELISA platform combined with an expanding menu of over 250 analytes to support therapeutic areas across neuroscience, cell and gene therapy immunology and cancer continues to resonate with both biopharma and academic customers.\nThis traction and acceptance in both industry and academia is apparent to the growing number of instruments in the field as Ella cross an important milestone in the quarter with over 1,000 instruments now in the field. In neuroscience, Ella's high level of sensitivity positions it as an ideal intent for biomarker detection and discovery making us the prime area for future menu expansion. We also continue to make progress for Parrinello to penetrate the clinical diagnostic market as our ISO 1345 audit of our Wangfu facility continues to progress.\nWith a growing installed base, a rapidly expanding menu and an untapped clinical diagnostic market opportunity, we continue to see incredibly bright future for Ella. Now let's discuss our biologics platform, Maurice, which enables protein purity, charge and identity analysis in 5 minutes in an easy-to-use cartridge-based instruments. Recall that we recently expanded on Maurice's capabilities with the launch of Maurice Flex, which adds image capillary isoelectric focusing fractionization capabilities to the instrument. Fractionation is a front-end step in masteromaty and Maurice select addresses the labor intensive and time consuming the challenges of using legacy fractionation, methods, including in exchange chromatography.\nThis new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market. Initial biopharm interest in Maurice Flex has been strong, and we had multiple initial instrument placements in the quarter. Our Simple Western platform continues to penetrate the Western blot market as its ability to automate the time-consuming and cumbersome with log process with a sample in enteral solution resonates within our biopharma and academic research end markets. Similar to our other platforms, applications for Simple Western are expanding, including quantitative immunoassays for both cell signaling and rare protein detection in complex lysates and rare tissues.\nAdditionally, our biopharma customers are increasingly relying on Simple Western in their gene therapy workflows, as its ability to detect protein-related impurities viral titer and identity information and empty versus full capsid information provide critical QA/QC information for these workflows. Gene therapy remains a nascent but rapidly growing application for Simple Western, and we experienced 30% growth in necessary during Q3. We also partnered with Selligent Technology, or CST, to expand the number of Simple Western validated antibodies for various targets and across multiple disciplines.\nCST is a leader in the development of antibodies and other related western blotting reagents used to elucidate cell signaling pathways that dictates cellular behavior and impact human health. We are excited about the addition of these new antibodies to the Bio-Techne catalog of validated antibodies and are encouraged with the market response following the announcement. Now let's shift to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue declined by 2%. Adjusting for the exit milestone from Thermal Fisher Scientific that we received in the comparable quarter last year, but did not repeat in the current quarter segment growth was upper single digits.\nStarting with our molecular diagnostics business, where we continue to experience increased physician adoption and utilization of our ExoDx prostate test leading to over 70% test volume growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and associated revenue increase of 85% in the quarter. We continue to see positive momentum on the key performance indicators we act for our ExoDx prostate test, including year-over-year and sequential growth in a number of physicians ordering the test record test volume from physicians new to the ExoDx as well as a record number of doctors ordering more than 25 tests in a quarter. We are pairing this volume momentum with continued progress in strengthening our coverage with private payers, as our recently bolstered market access group continues to move access to the large national payers, positioning ExoDx prostate for expanded future coverage.\nThe team is doing an excellent job managing a rapid growth in ExoDX prostate test by and we continue to experience record volumes in our core to date. During the quarter, an expanded local coverage determination from National Government Services, who is our Medicare administrative contractor, covering our Massachusetts Diagnostics CLIA-certified laboratory went into effect. This updated policy now covers the ExoDx prostate test for men with a prior negative biopsy but who are thought to be at high risk for prostate cancer and are considering a repeat biopsy.\nFollowing this update, the LCD now mirrors the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN guidelines and enables reimbursement for ExoDx Prostate is a monitoring tool in populations with and without a prior prostate biopsy, effectively increasing the total addressable market opportunity by approximately 50% for test. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, increased low double digits in the quarter with adoption in our flagship RNA scope assay remains strong.\nThis gold standard RNA institute hybridization assay enables industry-leading sensitivity and specificity transcriptome analysis while retaining tissue morphology. We furthered this industry-leading capability with the recent introduction of our new exceptionally bright vivid floor force, enabling customers to easily detect and visualize both abundant RNAs as well as RNAs of very low abundance in a tissue sample.\nMore recent additions to the ACD portfolio are also gaining traction, including BaseScope and micro and RNA scope. As these novel solutions enable visualization and evaluation of therapeutic biodistribution safety and efficacy of gene therapy delivery vectors and oligonucleotide therapies. BaseScope and MicroRNA scope are both relatively small contributors to our spatial biology business today but are growing rapidly and becoming progressively more accretive to the growth of this business. Continuing with spatial biology, we recently announced an important strategic partnership with Luna for who developed the first fully automated facial multiomic workflow with same slide HyperFlex detection of protein and RNA biomarkers on Lunipor's comment instrument.\nThis solution will enable users to easily visualize both LTIPs and their activation space in tissue. Combining COMET's highly flexible custom antibody panel design with RNAscope's library of 45,000 catalog probes and our in-house custom pro design capabilities will give customers the ultimate flexibility in achieving their study goals. In summary, our Q3 performance was in line with our expectations. As China growth snapped back and the temporary headwinds created by reagent destocking from a handful of OEM partners subside, we believe we are well positioned to accelerate growth next quarter and beyond. One thing is certain, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, a best-in-class liquid biopsy platform novel proteomic analytical tools, facial biology capabilities, multiple with an industry-leading catalog of bioactive content positions Bio-Techne to remain a leader in some of the most rapidly growing life science tools market. We look forward to continuing to execute our strategic growth plan and deliver on the vast opportunity in front of us.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck. Let's start with recapping the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.53, consistent with the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 or minus 2% in the quarter. GAAP EPS in Q3 was [ $0.43 ] compared to $0.37 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was a nonrecurring loss on our previously held ChemoCentryx investment in the prior year period. Q3 revenue was $24.1 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year on an organic basis and 1% on a reported basis.\nForeign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 2% and acquisitions had an immaterial impact on revenue growth. Chuck has called out the temporary headwinds we faced in Q3, and I will quantify their impact to overall company growth. Starting with prior year's extra true milestone payment. The impact of this onetime revenue recognition last year in Q3 was approximately a 3.5% headwind to our overall growth this year. The COVID infections and corresponding shutdowns in China this quarter was an additional headwind to overall company growth of approximately 2.5%. The OEM destocking of REO reagents, we estimate to be another 1.5% headwind on to our overall company growth rate.\nThe accumulation of these specific and temporary headwinds is approximately 7.5%, which and added back to our reported organic growth brings us to an adjusted organic growth rate of over 10%. The normalization of smaller biotech customer spend following a red hot funding environment the past couple of years is more difficult to quantify, but it is also a headwind that may take more time to work through. The biotech research is not going away. It is often the important innovative bridge between epidemic discovery and big pharma therapy commercialization. In the meantime, Bio-Techne will continue to serve all these customers in the life science change that ultimately brings quality of life to patients with innovative products that improve their likelihood of success and the most productive way possible.\nThe double-digit growth we see in our key growth platform cell gene therapy, Exosome Diagnostics, facial biology and protein simple branded automated assays demonstrate this is already the case. Moving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q3. North America grew mid-single digits. Europe demand increased upper single digits. China grew low single digits, while APAC declined low single digits due to prior year government stimulus in Japan not repeating this year.\nBy end market, biopharma grew high single digits, while academia grew mid-single digits. Both were partially offset by the impact of destocking by a handful of OEM customers. Further down the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 72.6% in the quarter compared to 73.2% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 27.9% of revenue compared to 26.1% in the prior year while R&D expense in Q3 was 7.7% of revenue compared to 7.5% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven by strategic growth investments made in Q4 of fiscal year '22 and the acquisition of [indiscernible].\nThe business has implemented strategic price increases during the first half of fiscal year '23 to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income, with pricing largely offsetting the inflation impact on our operating margin as well in Q3. Adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 37%, a decrease of 260 basis points from the prior year, but a 150 basis point improvement sequentially. The impact of the nonrecurring [indiscernible] milestone payment in the prior year period decreased margin by 130 basis points. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted operating margin by another 50 basis points, while the acquisition of NanoCell and other strategic growth investments drove the remainder of the margin dilution for the quarter.\nAs our top line headwinds start to subside, we will continue to make strategic investments in our key growth platforms to ensure their long-term momentum. By doing so, we expect operating margins in Q4 to be comparable to Q3.. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $0.2 million, decreasing $2 million compared to the prior year period due to lower debt levels and higher interest income earned on cash deposits. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at [ $370 ] million, an increase of $170 million compared to last quarter, with the increase reflecting our investment in Wilson Wolf, which was funded partially with debt and cash on hand.\nI would note, given the timing of the Wilson Wolf investment, which took place at the very end of our fiscal Q3, we anticipate our net interest expense to increase sequentially and to approximately $2.7 million in Q4. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $0.1 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash point arrangement.\nMoving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 21%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $50.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $11.7 million. Also during Q3, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.6 million dividend, and we finished the quarter with $161.6 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a strong position with $157.2 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments. And our total leverage ratio remains below 1 turn. And going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $218.9 million with reported revenue increasing 3% compared to the same period last year. Organic growth for this segment was 5%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 2%. Despite the temporary headwinds and the tough year-over-year comp, I will highlight that the longer-term fighter CAGR for this segment is approximately [indiscernible]. Operating Margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year with operational productivity more than offset by foreign exchange and the impact of the NanoCell acquisition.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $75.7 million, with reported revenue decreasing 3%. Organic revenue decreased 2% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 1% impact. As Chuck mentioned earlier, adjusting for the extra milestone payment we received in Q3 of last year, which did not regain this year, Organic growth was upper single digits for the segment. Our Exosome Diagnostics business remained incredibly strong in the quarter as our fortified marketing message, strengthened commercial team and the recently updated Medicare LCD drove record volume and revenue growth.\nOur spatial biology business returned to double-digit growth in the quarter with strong performances in our RNA scope, base scope, microRNA product line, partially offset by relative softness from a few biotech customers. Moving on to Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 15.2%. The segment's operating margin decreased 980 basis points compared to the prior year. Segment operating margin was unfavorably impacted primarily by prior year revenue related to the ExoTRU milestone payment. And, to a lesser extent, net inflation and strategic growth investments. Before we get to Q&A, we would summarize our fiscal year up to this point, our most recently completed quarter and our view looking forward as follows:\nFor much of the first half of our fiscal year, our customers were going to behave in a post-COVID pandemic world was rather murky. This included behaviors such as customers taking pent-up vacations last summer and fall, a more risk-off mentality for smaller biotech investing, government-induced shutdowns in our highest growth region in China, and a realization of the stocking that took place during the COVID-induced supply chain crunch that is now unwinding. These behavioral outcomes became clearer as we exited Q2 and gave us more visibility going forward.\nThrough it all, and as Q3 demonstrated, our growth platforms are still winning with double-digit growth. As we enter Q4, some of the headwinds should diminish, especially in China, but some are likely to remain, namely the OEM destocking and smaller biotech round life spending. Looking further ahead into fiscal year '24, these remaining headwinds should further diminish a double-digit revenue increases we see in our strategic growth platforms to once again be reflected in our headline numbers. In the meantime, we expect Q4 overall momentum to continue to improve from Q2 and Q3 with an overall growth rate likely similar to how we started the fiscal year in Q1.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over the operator to open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of IR & Corporate Development, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne.\nBefore we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results.\nThe company's 10-K for fiscal year 2022 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments.\nThe 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information relevant to ongoing business performance.\nTables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be presenting at the Citi, Cowen, Barclays and KeyBanc health care conferences in March. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck.\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nCEO, President & Director, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. In our second quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered 4% organic growth on top of a challenging year-on-year comp where we grew 17% in Q2 of last year.\nOne year ago, the life sciences industry was in the midst of an incredibly strong biotech funding environment spurred by COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic development that drove high equity valuations for smaller firms. It's been well documented that this funding environment has slowed in recent quarters, returning to pre-COVID levels. In Q2, we did experience a divergence in ordering patterns from our biotech end-market versus our larger pharma customer base, which is still very strong.\nThis divergence was seen in certain large bulk reagent orders, which did not repeat this year, and the delay of instrument orders as conservation of cash becomes more of a priority for our biotech customers.\nEncouragingly, the underlying research activity that accelerated during the past strong funding environment continues which is evident in the strength of our bio-pharma research reagent run rate business, continued cell and gene therapy growth and strong utilization trends within our proteomic and analytical tools.\nAlso, the order funnel for our protein and analytical instruments remains full, and we continue to experience record uptake of our ExoDx prostate test. I will provide additional details on each of these growth drivers later in the call.\nBefore we discuss the results, I'd first like to welcome [Shane Bohnen] to the leadership team of our new Senior Vice President, General Counsel effective March 3. Shane will be transitioning into this new role from Brenda Furlow who has served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for the past 9 years. The contributions Brenda has made to the company over the last 9 years are immeasurable, including establishing Bio-Techne's legal and compliance functions and leading our corporate sustainability initiatives. I wish Brenda the very best in her retirement.\nNow let's get into the specifics of the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. In Europe, we drove mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter, recovering nicely sequentially from the growth rates experienced in Q1. As a reminder, Europe grew in the mid-teens last year on the wave of stronger biotech funding. We see more stability in European end markets as the year progresses and concerns around high energy prices and severe recession have tempered.\nThe team is also nearly finished implementing a new Dublin warehouse to support Mainland Europe and a new ERP system that has been implemented with minimal disruption to our operations.\nNorth America is where we saw the biggest impact of lower biotech spend in Q2. However, North America was still able to grow low single digits on top of a prior year comp that experienced greater than 30% growth in bio-pharma and over 20% growth overall. The multiyear growth rates in North America are still double digit and in line with our long-term goals.\nThe consumable run rate business and instrument order book also suggests that underlying research activity is still robust, and this should become more evident as we pass the remainder of last fiscal year's high biotech comps.\nMoving on to China. I want to first acknowledge the tremendous dedication and resilience of our team there. Following multiple lockdowns, our team has continued to supply the Chinese research market with the proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions to enable scientific discoveries in this geography.\nNow following a change in COVID management strategy by the Chinese government, COVID is spreading rapidly in the country, including within our China team, which is over 90% infected at one point. Thankfully, this does not appear to be a particularly virulent strain and our impacted team members are typically back to the office within 5 to 10 days.\nDespite the disruption caused by the rapid spread of COVID, our team in China was still able to produce mid-single-digit growth in Q2. After the waves of COVID subside in China, most likely in our fiscal Q4, we believe a full re-opening of our end markets will accelerate faster compared to the government's prior zero-COVID strategy, positioning Bio-Techne for a sustainable return to our historic 20-plus percent growth rate in this region.\nGiven the proven pent-up demand in past shutdowns in 2020 and the pending RMB 1.7 trillion government stimulus, we see a strong Q4 looking ahead.\nNow let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where organic revenue increased 2% for the quarter on top of a strong comp from last year when the segment grew 19%. During the quarter, we continued to gain traction with our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions despite a challenging year-on-year comp where we grew our cell and gene therapy business over 80% organically in Q2 of last year and within that, our GMP protein is over 185%.\nWe still grew our cell and gene therapy portfolio over almost 20% in the quarter. Specific to our GMP proteins business, the commercial team did an excellent job growing business with existing customers as well as adding additional accounts during the quarter, culminating in a record quarter for our GMP protein business. The road map to adding additional GMP proteins to the menu produced in our state-of-the-art St. Paul manufacturing facility remains on track with plans in place to almost double in the number produced in this facility in the coming months.\nIt's worth noting that GMP protein sales are driving cross-selling activity throughout our portfolio as this growing list of customers are also frequently purchasing additional items, including RUO media, proteins and small molecules.\nSpeaking of small molecules, our GMP small molecules remain key components in the regenerative medicine cell therapy fields as they enable the reprogramming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to these workflows. Our leadership position in regenerative medicine workflow is driving substantial growth in our GMP small molecule business as well as specialty cell culture media, matrices in our portfolio of 19 GMP proteins that are focused to regenerative medicine, including 11 GMP proteins that are only available from Bio-Techne.\nThe growth is so profound in our GMP small molecules that we are drastically expanding our manufacturing capacity in Bristol, U.K.\nNow let's discuss our core portfolio of proteomic research reagents, including the RUO proteins, antibodies and small molecules that are key components to enabling bio-pharma and academic scientific discoveries. Collectively, our RUO reagents grew in the low teens in Q2 of last year, driven in part by a strong contribution from bulk reagent orders from biotech customers, some of which did not repeat during the quarter.\nWe are very encouraged that excluding these large orders, the performance of our run rate research reagent business remains very healthy, especially in the U.S. We continue to expand our catalog of research reagents, which now includes over 6,000 proteins, 425,000 antibody variations in a growing small molecule portfolio.\nFor example, during the quarter, we expanded the small molecule portfolio with the launch of our MitoBrilliant Fluorescent Dyes, enabling the fluorescent labeling and tracking of mitochondria in live and fixed cells. Initial reception to the launch was very strong with the initial production lot of these dyes selling out in the quarter. These dyes, when used with our new RNAscope Plus small RNA for co-detection gives extremely high resolution at a single cell level and a hard detect short-based RNA.\nMoving on to the performance of our ProteinSimple branded analytical tools, where the team delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. Here, we faced a particularly strong year-on-year comp of nearly 30% in the second quarter of prior year, driven by strong adoption among vaccine and monoclonal antibody therapeutic manufacturers for Maurice in the prior period. The rapid installed base growth we delivered over the past few years is leading to a strong consumer growth as our portfolio of biologics fully automated Western blot and multiplex immunoassay solutions become fully ingrained in our bio-pharma and academic customers processes.\nWe are very encouraged that the order funnel across all 3 of our instrument platforms remains very full, including a record level for our Maurice Biologics instrument, although the biotech funding environment has a length in the closing cycle.\nSimple Western lead instrument growth as the system's ability to automate the cumbersome and time-consuming Western blot process with a sample in and (inaudible) solution continues to resonate with our biopharma and academic research end markets.\nSimple Western is turning out to be much more than an automated Western blot replacement with the system's ability to identify and quantify proteins in complex samples like lysates, leading to its use of the quantitative immunoassay platform.\nThis expanded application for the system is driving usage in targeted protein degradation in drug tolerant studies, intracellular signaling the applications and is an alternative to customerized development.\nWe are actively implementing marketing strategies to educate the market on these additional applications.\nOn January 24, we officially launched our next-generation biologics platform, Maurice Flex at the WCBA Conference. As a reminder, we have seen tremendous adoption of the Maurice since its launch in 2016. With the system's ability to provide protein purity charge and identity in 5 minutes in an easy-to-use cartridge-based instrument driving robust demand for the platform.\nMaurice Flex expands on these capabilities, adding icIEF fractionation capabilities to instrument. Fractionation is a front-end step in mass spectrometry, where the sample to be analyzed is separated into mixture components based on differences in their size, charge or other characteristics.\nMaurice Flex addresses the labor-intensive and time-consuming challenges of using legacy fractionation methods, including ion exchange chromatography. This new application allows us to expand Maurice into a new $300 million market.\nNow for an update on our Simple Plex branded multiplexing immunoassay system, Ella. Ella's ease-of-use subpicogram sensitivity, smaller footprint and cost advantages, continue to draw increased attention from bio-pharma and academic researchers. As our installed base of Ella systems continues to grow, now nearing 1,000 placements and utilization trends remain robust, we opened a new state-of-the-art product innovation and manufacturing facility to meet current and forecasted cartridge demand. This new facility adds laboratory, manufacturing and clean room space and increases cartridge capacity to 500,000 cartridges per year.\nWe also successfully completed the initial ISO 1345 audit of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility as we prepare Ella to make inroads into the large and nascent clinical diagnostics opportunities that exist for the platform. icIEF is possibly our largest instrument platform someday. No other tool works so well across both biomarker discovery and diagnostics.\nRounding out our instrument platforms, let's now discuss Namocell, our single cell separation and dispensing platform. Recall that we closed on the Namocell acquisition in July of 2022, and we are pleased with growing interest in this novel technology as well as the progress we have made integrating the team and the business.\nDuring the quarter, a single cell cloning workflow publication using the Namocell single-cell isolation and dispensing platform was featured in nature protocols.\nThe study outlines a robust and scale workflow that maximize cell viability for cloning human pluripotent stem cells or HPSC using Namocell's low-pressure microfluidic technology, which ensures gentle and rapid dispensing of cells.\nWe are in the early stages of realizing the potential of the Namocell platform and see a bright future for this technology, having shipped over 100 instruments to date.\nNow let's shift to Diagnostics and Genomics segment where we grew revenue by 7% organically in the quarter. Let's start with a discussion of our molecular diagnostics business and the continued adoption of our ExoDx prostate cancer test.\nDuring the quarter, the team delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of record test volume as the number of tests reformed increased over 70% and revenue grew over 110% in the quarter. The combination of a strengthened marketing message to the urology community that emphasizes ExoDx is a tool to identify not only the right patients for prostate biopsy, but also drive patient adherence to biopsy recommendations, a 4 to 5 and expanded commercial team as well as the favorable impact of our reconsidered local coverage decision, LCD, with our Medicare contractor has driven sustained momentum in the business.\nWe are seeing strong trends across the key performance indicators we track for the ExoDx prostate test, including the number of ordering doctors, the average number of tests ordered per doctor and the number of new doctors over in which all set records in the quarter. We also hired a veteran reimbursement executive with a redesigned game plan to drive favorable coverage decisions within the private payer community. With less than 20% penetration of urologists in the U.S. who have used the test at least once and the potential to expand the usage of our test among current doctors by 5x, we are positioned to continue the strong growth in this business for the remainder of fiscal 2023 and for the years beyond.\nContinuing with molecular diagnostics. Asuragen branded genetic carrier screening and oncology kits continue to grow double digit. During the quarter, Asuragen announced a partnership with Oxford Nanopore technologies to develop assays designed to deliver more accurate and reliable options for reproductive health and carrier screening.\nThe collaboration combines Asuragen's long-range PCR and Oxford Nanopore's any-read length sequencing capabilities in a single workflow to identify genetic sequence variance in both hard to decipher genes and conventional genes using a single sequencing system.\nOur spatial biology business, branded ACD, grew mid-single digits in the quarter as a softer biotech market provided some headwinds similar to Protein Sciences. Our professional assay service business had a strong quarter as revenue increased nearly 20% year-on-year.\nHistorically, accounts leveraging ACD's pharma assay services capabilities for biomarker discovery eventually transitioned into product customers, making strength in the service business, a proxy for future product demand.\nWe recently expanded our ACD portfolio with the launch of RNAscope Plus small RNA, enabling the simultaneous fluorescent detection of small regulatory RNA using our new Vivid dye, including microRNA together with 3 target RNAs or RNA biomarkers in the same tissue section at single cell and subcellular resolution.\nRNAscope Plus provides gene therapy researchers with a valuable new tool to quantify changes in gene expression and cellular function in response to the introduction of regulatory RNAs, which is essential for optimization efficiency and safety.\nI would note, RNAscope Plus was initially offered through spatial biology's professional assay services where it saw an overwhelmingly positive customer response.\nLastly, we experienced low single-digit growth in our diagnostic reagents and controls business as order timing among a handful of customers impacted the quarter. Looking at this business on a trailing 12-month basis, growth remains in the mid-single digits. With patients returning to their physicians, demand for diagnostic testing is increasing. This favorable macro environment, plus a strong pipeline of additional products positions our diagnostic reagents and controls for future growth.\nIn summary, despite the temporary challenges created by the current biotech funding environment and the COVID impact in China, our team continues to successfully navigate this dynamic environment and grow the business. The long-term tailwinds supporting proteomic scientific research, cell and gene therapies, spatial biology and liquid biopsies remain firmly intact, and our portfolio is ideally suited to capitalize on these opportunities as they shape the future of life science research and health care. The team to execute our strategy is in place at full strength, and we remain well positioned and more optimistic than ever to deliver on our long-term targets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that Bio-Techne executed a 4-for-1 stock split on November 29, 2022. All references to share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the stock split.\nNow let's start with the overall second quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.47, consistent with the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 or minus 4% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.49 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was a nonrecurring gain on our previously held ChemoCentryx investment in the prior year period.\nQ2 revenue was $271.6 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year on an organic basis and 1% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 4% and acquisitions had a favorable impact of 1% to revenue growth.\nAs Chuck mentioned, following a period of red hot biotech funding last year, we are seeing a normalization of purchasing trends from these customers. Additionally, COVID is now sweeping through China and slowing the amount of research activity in this region temporarily impacting the growth of our proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology products.\nAdjusting our organic growth rate for large orders from a handful of biotech customers that did not repeat and normalizing for China, our organic growth would have been double digits in the quarter.\nSummarizing our organic growth by region and end market in Q2. North America grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, China grew mid-single digits, while APAC was flat due to prior year government stimulus in Japan not repeating this year.\nBy end market, biopharma grew low single digits, while academic grew mid-single digits. We are encouraged by the revenue growth from our large pharma customers as well as the underlying health of the overall bio-pharma end market as is reflected in the continued strong momentum in our run rate business.\nFor academia, we are encouraged by the recent NIH outlay data, which showed a 13% year-over-year increase in our second quarter. We anticipate this strong NIH allay begin to work its way through the system and benefit academic life science research spending in the near term. Additionally, the. 5.6% NIH budget increase and 50% (inaudible) budget increase for the federal government's fiscal 2023, sets the stage for a healthy academic end market for the remainder of our fiscal year.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.7% in the quarter compared to 72.3% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 27.9% of revenue compared to 26.5% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 8.3% of revenue compared to 7.5% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven by wage inflation and the acquisition of Namocell. The business has implemented strategic price increases during the first half of fiscal year '23 to offset the dollar impact of inflation and operating income. However, the dollar for dollar offset did have a negative impact on operating margin.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q2 was 35.5%, a decrease of 280 basis points from the prior year period. Negative FX impact decreased margin by 100 basis points, the pricing inflation dynamic decreased adjusted operating margin by another 50 basis points. While the acquisition of Namocell and timing of other fiscal year '22 growth investments drove the remainder of the margin dilution for the quarter.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect adjusted operating margins to continue to expand sequentially, ending the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23, up to 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q2 was $1.2 million, decreasing $1.3 million compared to the prior year period. Our bank debt on the balance sheet at the end of Q2 stood at $200 million, a decrease of $64.7 million compared to last quarter.\nOther adjusted net operating income was flat in the quarter, an increase of $1.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements.\nMoving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 21%.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $64.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment and capital expenditures was $6.1 million. Also during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.5 million in dividends.\nFollowing our 4-for-1 stock split, we finished the quarter with 161.8 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q2 in a very strong position with $196.8 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments bringing our net debt position very close to 0.\nGoing forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $203.9 million, with reported revenue decreasing 1%. Organic growth for the segment was 2% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 4% and acquisitions contributing 1%.\nDespite the temporary headwinds and the tough year-over-year comps that Chuck pointed out for this segment, I will highlight that the longer-term 5-year organic CAGR for this segment is approximately 11%. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points year-over-year, with operational productivity more than offset by foreign exchange, price inflation dynamics and the impact of Namocell acquisition.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q2 reported sales were $68 million with reported revenue increasing 5%. Organic growth for the segment was 7% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 2% impact. As you heard from Chuck earlier, our Exosome Diagnostics business remained incredibly strong in the quarter, as our fortified marketing message and strengthened commercial team continue to drive test volume and revenue growth.\nOur spatial biology business grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with strong performance in our professional assay services and microRNA businesses, partially offset by order timing from a few bio-pharma customers.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.2%. The segment operating margin decreased 470 basis points compared to the prior year. The segment's operating margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, price inflation dynamics and the timing of strategic growth investments.\nAs we think about the setup for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to reflect on the drivers of our performance in the first half relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our Q1 relative performance was muddled by the pent-up vacation activity we saw from our customers as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns, especially in Europe.\nIn Q2, we saw the slowing of large orders from our biotech customers that possibly could have been foreshadowed by the slowdown in biotech funding earlier in the calendar year. However, the impact to our business was not realized until the December quarter just ended. And throughout the entire first half of our fiscal year '23, the COVID situation in China has been on a roller coaster with rolling government-mandated shutdown and now widespread infections.\nDespite all of this, as Chuck and I have expressed on this call, we believe our end markets are still very healthy, and our portfolio positioning is still very strong. Big pharma demand is high. Academic research budgets are on the rise, and most biotechs are not broke, just being more prudent. And finally, China appears to be closer to the end of the COVID roller coaster than ever before with pent-up demand and strong Chinese government stimulus setting up for what could be an incredible calendar year 2023.\nBut we need to get through the March ended quarter, our fiscal Q3 first and right now, it appears as though our organic growth this quarter will be similar to that of Q2. People in China are still sick with COVID and in Protein Sciences, we know of several large biotech orders that occurred last year in Q3 that are unlikely to repeat this year.\nAlso in Q3, we will be lapping the large milestone payment realized in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment from the ExoTRU kidney transplant rejection assay licensing agreement made with Thermo Fisher last year. As we lap these difficult year-over-year comps, the normalization of biotech funding runs its course and COVID headwinds alleviate in China, we anticipate organic growth to improve significantly in Q4, positioning the company for continued progress on delivering our long-term strategic and financial targets.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of IR & Corporate Development, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne.\nBefore we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2022 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section.\nDuring the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com.\nSeparately, we will be presenting at the Credit Suisse, Stifel, Stephens and Evercore ISI health care conferences in November. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck.\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nCEO, President & Director, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call.\nI'm pleased to report that we started our fiscal '23 with a respectable 7% organic revenue growth on top [of] what was our most challenging year-on-year comp of over 21% organic growth in Q1 of last year. We achieved this growth despite a slower summer for our business in Europe and continued, although improving COVID-related shutdowns in China. With the tough comps and we believe temporary regional challenges that our Protein Sciences segment faced, this was the quarter for our Diagnostics and Genomics segment to shine, and China did with 17% organic growth. In our first quarter, we accelerated our Spatial Biology business to upper teen growth. We continue to drive incredible uptake in doctor and patient usage of our ExoDx Prostate test, and we delivered double-digit growth in our (inaudible) DX and Diagnostic Reagents businesses.\nI will dig into the traction and encouraging trends we are seeing across this segment and our broader portfolio later in the call. But first I'd like (inaudible) corporate sustainability report we recently issued, which details the significance progress we continue to make advancing our environmental, social and governance initiatives. The [64-page] report provides insights into Bio-Techne's commitment to growing the organization in a responsible manner while we deliver the products necessary to advance science and ultimately improve health care. Our advancements on the ESG front also led to Bio-Techne's inclusion in the 2022 Forbes list of [best in-state employers] with this latest achievement representing the third recognition from Forbes so far in calendar 2022.\nI'd also like to briefly touch on how we are navigating the current global inflationary environment. The team has done an extraordinary job of strategically implementing price increases across portfolio to offset the impact of inflation. We will continue to leverage our pricing power to us at [rising costs], particularly labor going forward. It should also be noted that our operations team has delivered consistently with no supply chain issues this quarter or any in the past days.\nNow let's discuss specifics of our quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end markets. In North America, consistent execution across the portfolio drove low double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, driven by a continued strong biopharma end market.\nIn Europe, our revenue decreased mid-single digits year-over-year. Here, we experienced an exceptionally slower seasonal summer dip in our consumable run rate business. It seemed like everyone was on vacation in July and August, perhaps making up for the prior 2 COVID years when travel was more restricted. Any case, our run rates in Europe picked up considerably in September as researchers seemingly returned to the labs. However, the strong double-digit growth in September, which, by the way, is continuing in October wasn't enough to overcome the tough Q1 growth comp Europe had last year when they grew a record 20%. While there are potential macro challenges in the current European environment, our portfolio of proteomics research reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions remain core components to the scientific discovery process and position us to effectively navigate any near-term regional instability.\nMoving on to China. Despite the lingering impact of ongoing COVID-related lockdowns and academic institutions not returning to the labs, we delivered mid-single-digit organic growth. On top of the COVID challenges, I'd also note that China faced a particularly challenging year-over-year comparison where we grew revenue by over 50% in the region last year. We see China rapidly returning to its historical growth rates as prior year comps normalize. Customers continue to better navigate the sporadic COVID-related government restrictions and the Chinese government continues to emphasize investing in health care.\nOur biopharma end market remains healthy, growing upper single digits globally for the quarter and especially stronger in North America with growth in the mid-teens. Sales to our academic end markets increased low single digits year-over-year, but again, we're stronger in North America.\nNow let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where organic revenue increased 3% for the quarter on a very strong comp from last year, when the segment grew by 26%. Let's begin with our cell and gene therapy business, where our portfolio reagents, instruments, media and technologies, streamline workflows, increased efficiencies and ultimately expand [access] to these next-generation therapies at lower cost to the health care system.\nWe haven't discussed TcBuster for a while, so I will update you on the significant progress we are experiencing with our nonviral gene editing technology. TcBuster had several advantages over legacy gene editing methods, including its ability to deliver larger gene editing cargo as well as a more predictable gene insertion location, all at a lower cost compared to viral-based gene insertion methods. We continue to educate the market on the advantages of TcBuster, and it's worth noting that we have signed a handful of commercial licenses to support a growing pipeline of cell therapies primarily for T cell and NK cell therapies. In addition to customers testing TcBuster for therapeutic candidates, we also see growing interest in discovery research to take advantage of the technology at lower cost and increased speed, enabling the acceleration of a [candidate] selection. TcBuster is currently being trialed in dozens of unique therapies, and we believe the future is very bright for this technology.\nWe continue to penetrate the [burgeon] in cell therapy opportunity with our portfolio of GMP proteins and are seeing continued momentum in the regenerative medicine or regen med market. As a reminder, regen med is a form of cell therapy that leverages stem cells or the derivatives to promote the repair response of diseased, dysfunctional or injured tissues.\nOur GMP capabilities expand beyond proteins and include a portfolio of GMP small molecules. These small molecules are key components in the reprogramming, self-renewal storage and differentiation processes that are key to regen med workflows. While our GMP small molecules business is relatively small today, it is growing rapidly, including over 100% for our first quarter and has potential to become a significant contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy business.\nNow let's talk about our core portfolio of Proteomic research reagents, including the RUO proteins, antibodies and small molecules that are key components to enabling biopharma and academic scientific discoveries. Collectively, our RUO reagents grew nearly 30% in Q1 last year, again, highlighting how difficult this quarter's comp was. Despite the high hurdle, our RUO reagents were able to grow mid-single digit in Q1 of this year, driven by our digital marketing capabilities.\nMoving on to the performance of our Proteomic analytical tools, where we also faced a challenging year-over-year comparison as the business grew over 25% in the same quarter last fiscal year. Overall, the team delivered double-digit growth in North America and China, which was partially offset by a much lower performance in Europe, leading to low single-digit growth for the quarter.\nOnce again, our biologics platform (inaudible), we continue to see demand from protein therapeutics, gene therapy and CRO, CDMO customers, particularly in North America and China, where combined growth was over 20%. Innovation remains a key factor in the growth of our biologics business. For example, we recently unveiled data demonstrating icIEF fractionalization on the soon-to-be launched Maurice Flex instrument. Fractionalization is a front-end step in mass spectrometry where the sample to be analyzed is separated into mixture components based on differences in their size, charge or other characteristics. The data showed how Maurice Flex addresses the labor intensive and time-consuming challenges of using legacy methods, including ion exchange chromatography for fractionization. Maurice Flex is scheduled for release in early 2023.\nIn addition to the expanding Maurice capabilities and applications, the platform is also gaining recognition for its environmentally friendly attributes. A recent study in the green analytical chemistry journal highlighted Maurice as an environmentally-friendly method for evaluating the identity and stability of adeno-associated virus or AAV samples for gene therapy development. The study highlights Maurice's low sample and reagent volume requirements in built-in with reservoir is environmentally friendly attributes to the system.\nWe continue to expand the capabilities of our ProteinSimple line of instruments in cell and gene therapy applications. During the quarter, we added 3 new viral titer assays for the expanding menu of our automated multiplexing ELISA instrument Ella for intact AAV capsid quantification in gene therapy research and development.\nElla's wide dynamic range and high precision [ensures users] to get the high-quality data required to meet regulatory standards for AAV titration through our bioproduction workflows.\nNow let's shift to Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where we grew revenue by 17% organically in the quarter. Our Spatial Biology business, branded ACD, accelerated to upper teens growth in the quarter as strong commercial execution and an enhanced marketing strategy generated well-balanced growth in both our biopharma and academic end markets. In addition to a strong performance from the core RNAscope product line, we are seeing increased traction from our BaseScope and [miRNAscope] offerings in cell and gene therapy applications, which grew almost 50% and over 70%, respectively. BaseScope and miRNAscope are rapidly becoming material contributors to our Spatial Biology franchise.\nWe recently expanded our RNAscope portfolio with the launch of new automated co-detection assays, specifically designed for the Roche Discovery Ultra platform, enabling simultaneous detection of RNA and protein on the same tissue section. These new automated multi-omic assays utilize both RNAscope and BaseScope signal application to deliver best-in-class RNA sensitivity and specificity. When combined with protein detection on Roche's automated platform, researchers will be uniquely enabled to power translational and clinical research studies.\nWe are also unlocking the cross segments synergies inherent in the broad Bio-Techne product portfolio. As an example, we recently launched the TSA Vivid Fluorophores for highly sensitive fluorescent detection of RNAs and proteins in cells and tissues. Pairing these key fluorescent (inaudible) reagents from our small molecules business with ACD's RNAscope sets a new standard for illuminating RNA biomarkers with industry-leading sensitivity and clarity.\nRounding out Spatial Biology. We also recently filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United Kingdom to halt the infringement of our patent RNAscope ISH technology by Molecular Instruments Incorporated. We have made significant investments over the years to build our catalog of over 40,000 RNAscope ISH probes, available in over 400 species and remain committed to protecting these investments and defending our intellectual property rights in our Spatial Biology business. And more broadly throughout the portfolio.\nNow let's discuss our Molecular Diagnostics business, starting with the significant progress in our Exosome Diagnostics business. Test [following in] our ExoDx Prostate or EPI test increased over [7%], while associated revenue grew by 100% in the quarter. Importantly, a favorable doctor retention trends and steady increases in the ordering physician base sets the stage for continued robust ExoDx Prostate growth going forward. I am extremely pleased with the traction we are seeing in ExoDx Prostate and believe our fiscal 2023 will be the breakout year for this test.\nExosome Diagnostics also announced initial data on a novel noninvasive saliva-based profiling assay leveraging Exosomes to diagnose and monitor individuals with Sjögren's Syndrome. Sjögren's Syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is often undiagnosed and misdiagnosed with an estimated 4 million Americans currently living with condition, but 2.5 million undiagnosed. Symptoms of Sjögren's Syndrome can mimic other autoimmune diseases, allergies, drug side effects and menopause making diagnosis particularly challenging, leading to an average diagnosis time of 3 years and creating a need for a noninvasive accurate molecular test. We are looking forward to providing future updates for this exciting pipeline assay.\nA recent proof-of-concept study for a novel Exosome-based platform capable of monitoring spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome or SANS in astronauts was published in npj Microgravity [for nature] publication. In addition to potentially providing a needed tool to assist SANS in astronauts that are going on longer missions as well as commercial space passengers. The study showcases the potential power of Exosomes for the diagnosis of neurological conditions.\n[In Molecular] Diagnostics, Asuragen had another great quarter as demand for its portfolio of genetic carrier screening kits [and] expansion in the Europe drove growth of almost 25% for the quarter. In addition to the ongoing geographic expansion, Asuragen has a rich product pipeline, positioning the business for continued growth going forward.\nFinally, our Diagnostics Reagents business continued its [streak] of consistent growth quarters. The return of patients to the doctor's office is driving demand for hematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry tests, which is driving demand for our clinical [controls] reagents. These improving underlying diagnostic trends combined with market share gains and increased wallet share at existing customers led to a low double-digit growth in the quarter and sets the stage for a sustainable growth in our Diagnostic Reagents business forward.\nIn summary, we continue to execute our growth strategy and remain on track to deliver our long-term financial targets. Our portfolio of proteomic research reagents and analytical tools are critical components of scientific research. Our key to unlocking the full promise of the proteomic revolution currently underway and are positioned to enable the [oncoming biowave] of cell and gene therapy. [Layer on] to this, the portfolio of Diagnostics and Genomics solutions include our leading platforms in spatial biology and liquid biopsy, and I believe we are getting started unlocking the full potential value of this business.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck.\nI will provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year.\nStarting with the overall first quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.78 versus $1.83 one year ago, a decrease of 3% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.12 or minus 7% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $2.21 compared to $1.69 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was realized gains on the sale of our investments in ChemoCentryx and Eminence during the quarter.\nQ1 revenue was $269.7 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and 7% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 3% and acquisitions had a favorable impact of 1% to revenue growth.\nGiven the tough comp we faced this quarter versus the prior year, I will point out that our 2-year organic growth CAGR for Q1 was approximately 13%, right in line with the early part of the 5-year plan our leadership team presented at our Investor Day in New York City a little over a year ago.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 70.9% in the quarter compared to 71.2% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by productivity gains. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 27.3% of revenue compared to 25.1% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q1 was 8.9% of revenue compared to 8.3% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D (inaudible) wage inflation and progress made in the second half of fiscal year '22 in building the team to support ongoing strategic growth investments.\nSpeaking of inflation, the business has implemented strategic price increases during the quarter to offset the dollar impact of inflation on operating income. However, the dollar-for-dollar offset did have a negative impact on operating margin.\nAdjusted operating margin for Q1 was 34.8%, a decrease of 300 basis points from the prior year period. The pricing inflation dynamic decreased adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points. Negative foreign [change] decreased margin by another 110 basis points, while carryover of second half fiscal year '22 investments drove the remainder of the margin dilution for the quarter.\nAs stated in the fourth quarter fiscal year '22 earnings call, we expect Q1 to be a low point for adjusted operating margins for the year. Going forward, we expect adjusted operating margins to expand sequentially, ending the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23, approximately 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. For the full year fiscal year '23, our expectation for adjusted operating margins to be approximately 150 basis points lower than the full year fiscal year '22 remains unchanged.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $3 million, decreasing $0.1 million compared to the prior year period. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $264.7 million, an increase of $8.8 million compared to where we finished last fiscal year. During the quarter, we drew down approximately $100 million on [our credits] to fund the Namocell acquisition, which was partially offset by applying the proceeds of our ChemoCentryx investment sale to our debt balance.\nOther adjusted nonoperating income was $1.2 million for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes realized gains from the sale of our investment in ChemoCentryx and Eminence. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21%.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $56.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $9.6 million. Also during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $19.6 million in stock buybacks and $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 40.5 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur balance sheet finished Q1 in a very strong position with $203.1 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. Our net leverage ratio remains well below 1x TTM EBITDA. During the quarter, we replaced our previous debt financing with a new $1 billion line of credit facility with a 5-year term. Our corp dev team has been very active investigating external investment opportunities and this new increased debt facility emphasizes the continued importance M&A will have in our capital allocation strategy.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were $199.9 million, with reported revenue increasing 1%. Organic growth for the segment was 3% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 3% and acquisitions contributing 1%. Given the tough year-over-year comps that Chuck pointed out for this segment, I will highlight that the 2-year organic growth CAGR for this segment is greater than 14%, and the longer-term historical 5-year CAGR is approximately 12%. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.0%, a decrease of 270 basis points year-over-year with productivity gains more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange, price versus inflation dynamics, the fiscal year '22 carryover of strategic investments to support future growth and the Namocell acquisition.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $69.9 million, with reported revenue increasing 50%. Organic growth for the segment was 17%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 2% impact. As you heard from Chuck earlier, the double-digit growth was broad-based throughout the segment with Spatial Biology accelerating a high-teens organic growth and our Exosome Diagnostic Prostate test really now in hyper growth mode with the Medicare reimbursement and COVID headwinds behind it.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.4%. The segment's operating margin increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and price versus inflation dynamics.\nLooking ahead, our markets remain healthy, and our momentum in capturing share in these markets is in line with our 5-year plan. As we get past the recent regional challenges in Europe and in China, we are keeping a watchful eye on any potential short-term macro challenges that could impact our trajectory to our long-term goal. With confidence in our nimble and experienced team who has a track record of successfully navigating dynamic environment. With the toughest comp of the year now in our rearview mirror, we anticipate a return to double-digit organic growth for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions.",

We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck.\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nCEO, President & Director, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. We had a tremendous finish to our fiscal 2022 as our 14% organic growth for the fourth quarter half of the year where we delivered 17% organic growth for the full fiscal year.\nIn our fiscal 2022, we surpassed an important milestone as we exceeded $1 billion, actually $1.1 billion in revenue for the first time in our corporate history. These strong results were delivered in the face of the most challenging comp the company has faced since I joined in 2013. And the impact of a longer-than-expected COVID-related shutdown in China. I'm extremely proud of the global team's strong execution in this dynamic environment.\nSome of the highlights in the quarter include continued strength in our biologics instrument portfolio, where we delivered over 30% growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, ongoing traction with our cell and gene therapy workflow initiatives, a return to double-digit growth in our spatial biology business as well as another consecutive record-setting quarter for our ExoDx prostate test.\nWe remain incredibly well positioned and underpenetrated in some of the fastest-growing life science tools and diagnostics markets and our portfolio proteomic, genomic and diagnostic products continue to deliver the solutions necessary to drive scientific discoveries and ultimately improve health care.\nGiven the inflationary environment we are all dealing with, let's briefly discuss how we are successfully navigating these challenges. As a reminder, approximately 80% of our revenue mix is consumables and encouragingly, given their biological nature, these tend to have more modest raw material costs. Approximately 10% of our sales are instrumentation where we do have higher input costs but still maintain gross margins in line with corporate averages.\nWe have been strategically implementing price increases throughout our portfolio to offset our exposure to rising costs including labor, and we'll continue to pull this lever going forward. Speaking of labor, we made significant progress in our human capital initiatives in the quarter. Encouragingly, we are seeing signs of an improving labor market as some of the headwinds we faced in recent quarters to attract and retain talent appear to be subsiding. In fiscal 2022, we added over 400 individuals to the team and have grown to over 3,000 Bio-Techne team members. These net headcount additions were across the organization as we strengthen the commercial, technical and corporate team at all levels. We will continue to hire as we execute our strategic growth initiatives going forward, and I'm very encouraged with the recent progress on this front.\nNow let's discuss the specifics of our performance this quarter, starting with our geographies and end markets. From a global perspective, we experienced robust growth across geographies with the exception of China. Our North American revenue grew in the upper teens for both the quarter and our fiscal year. In Europe, we finished on a very strong note as we grew in the mid-teens for both the quarter and the fiscal year.\nFor China, first, I'd like to recognize the relentless efforts of the team. Our China-based team successfully petitioned to be one of the initial companies permitted to return to work as our products were deemed to be critical to the country. Once we are allowed back in our Shanghai-based warehouse that serves as a distribution hub to all of our China-based customers, our dedicated team literally lived at the facility to ensure we were able to begin supplying the research community with proteomic reagents, analytical tools and a spatial biology product.\nThese COVID-related lockdowns lasted longer than expected in several large cities. Overall, organic revenue in China declined low single digits for the quarter. These important Chinese markets started the reopening process in June and we saw a nice bounce back in revenue, especially in our research reagents business. The strong June performance is encouraging, and we look forward to returning to our historical growth trajectory in this geography.\nOnce again, our biopharma end market remained very strong, growing over 20% globally for both the quarter and the fiscal 2022. Sales in our academic end market increased in the upper single digits for the quarter and the mid-single digits for the fiscal year. We are seeing signs of continued improvement in our U.S. academic end market, as research budget clarity and increased NIH outlays are benefiting spending on our research reagents, proteomic analytical tools and spatial biology solutions.\nNow let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where we grew organically by 16% for the quarter and 19% for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we advanced our cell and gene therapy initiative as our reagents, media technology and workflow solutions continue to deliver the necessary solutions to progress therapy development in clinical trials.\nBefore we get into the numbers, I'd like to highlight an emerging cell therapy application called regenerative medicine it is garnering significant investment in clinical trial activity, which in turn is driving growth in our technologies and products enabling these workflows. Its background, regenerative medicine or Regen Med leverages stem cells or their derivatives to promote the repair response of disease dysfunctional or injured tissues. Stem cells are unique as they can be induced to differentiate into any cell type. For example, muscle, heart, pancreatic, nerve and blood cells. This functionality has found robust biopharma activity to use stem cells as a treatment and potential cure for of many diseases and chronic conditions, including diabetes, tissue repair, spinal cord injury, chronic wound healing and others.\nThis increased activity is sparking demand across our portfolio of cell therapy products and technologies, including reagents, assays, media, instruments and spatial biology products.\nOur portfolio of GMP proteins includes 19 cytokines including 11 that are only available from Bio-Techne that are key to scaling these Regen Med activities.\nThis interest in Regen Med is also acting as a significant tailwind for our Matrix products as these provide structural support for cells and play an important role in establishing tissue organization by influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation.\nOur portfolio of Matrix products increased over 110% in the quarter and are quickly becoming significant contributors to our burgeoning cell and gene therapy business. Specifically for our GMP protein business, during the quarter, we transitioned 2 additional GMP proteins to our state-of-the-art GMP protein dedicated manufacturing facility. Following these latest launches, we are now manufacturing 5 GMP proteins in this new facility at the scale and capacity necessary to meet current forecasted demand.\nOverall, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products, technologies and solutions increased over 50% for fiscal 2022.\nNow let's discuss the performance of our research reagent portfolio, including our broad catalog of RUO proteins and antibodies. Once again, our brand reputation targeted new product introductions, marketing strategy and execution above market growth as our research reagents increased low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for fiscal 2022.\nDuring the fiscal year, we added approximately 1,000 new R&D Systems branded proteins, antibodies and small molecules, including research reagents strengthening our core portfolio in immunology, immunonocology and targeted protein degradation.\nShifting to our proteomic analytical tool where the team delivered mid-teens growth for the quarter and high teens growth for the fiscal year. Once again, our biologics platform Maurice led the way, increasing 35% in the quarter. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of above 30% growth for this platform as we continue to see strong demand from protein therapeutics, gene therapy and CRO, CDMO customers.\nWe recently dramatically improved Maurice's speed with the launch of the Turbo CE-SDS cartridge. This new cartridge delivers a 400% throughput increase compared to legacy cartridges, enabling higher speed and high-resolution analysis of protein size impurity across all stages of bioprocess development as well as regulated areas, including quality control.\nSeparately, a multi-company study published in the journal of electrophoresis showed excellent comparability of Maurice to its predecessor instrument iCE3. As background, we launched Maurice in 2016 as the next-generation system in our iCE instream portfolio. Multiple biopharma companies have requested comparability data between iCE3 and Maurice prior to upgrading, and we anticipate this study will help these customers eventually transition to Maurice, which offers ease of use and increased functionality compared to the legacy system.\nOur Simple Western portfolio of automated Western blot solutions continues to gain share as the ease of use, reproducibility and speed compared to manual methods resonates with both biopharma and academic end users. This growing awareness and utilization of Simple Western is evident when looking at the number of publications citing Simple Western data.\nAs of the end of the quarter, there were over 1,600 cumulative publications siting our Simple Western technology, representing an increase of 12% during the first half of calendar 2022. We view publications as a leading indicator for the growing acceptance of this technology and believe we are positioned for continued growth going forward. Our Simple Western business increased in the mid-teens for the quarter and in the high teens for the fiscal year.\nWe continue to experience strong demand for our Simple Plex automated immunoassay platform Ella from cell and gene therapy customers as our recent assay additions for AAV characterization, [PEP293-hostile proteins] and Perforin drive adoption in both process development and QC release. In fact, we increased the number of CGT customers, cell and gene therapy that is, leveraging Ella and their workflow by over 65% during the fiscal year and anticipate growing interest from additional accounts as we continue to expand our relevant menu offerings.\nDuring the quarter, we announced the latest addition to our family of instruments and consumables with the acquisition of Namocell, a leading cell sorting and dispensing company with 2 instruments currently in the market. Namocell's proprietary instruments and consumables address several high-growth markets, including cell and gene therapy, cell engineering, cell line development, single-cell genomics, antibody discovery, synthetic biology and rare cell isolation.\nWhile Namocell's business is relatively small today, it is growing quickly, and we are excited to have this technology and talented team under the Bio-Techne umbrella. We closed this acquisition on July 1 and initial integration work is progressing nicely.\nLastly, our immunoassay kit business finished the year on a very strong note as this business grew low double digits for both the quarter and the fiscal year. In addition to healthy demand for our ELISA kits, we are increasingly being recognized as the partner of choice for developing Luminex assays for our partners to run his lab designated test or LDT.\nFor example, we recently announced an agreement as the exclusive manufacturer of Nonagen's Biosciences Oncuria bladder cancer diagnostic panel. This Luminex based multiplex panel combines Bio-Techne's high-quality reagents and over 40 years of industry-leading immunoassay experience with Nonagen's diagnostic experience to create a powerful solution to advanced bladder cancer treatment strategies.\nNext, let's discuss our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where we grew revenue organically by 8% in the quarter and 10% for the full fiscal year. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, remains the largest global spatial biology business as our highly sensitive biomarker identification technology with single cell detection, resolution and quantification capabilities continues to enable the transition from discovery to translational research.\nSpatial biology returned to double-digit growth in the quarter as an improving academic market and the impact of our fortified leadership in North American commercial teams offset a challenging year-over-year comp and the impact of the China shutdown.\nDuring the quarter, we achieved a significant milestone for our spatial biology business as our market-leading portfolio across 40,000 unique RNA scope in situ hybridization probes in over 400 species. We also announced the launch of our CE-IVD marked RNAscope ISH probe high-risk HPV assay for use in patients with head and neck cancer to aid in the identification of high-risk human papillomavirus, HPV for use on the automated Leica Biosystem's Bond-III stainer.\nWith our sales territories occupied, the leadership team in place to drive this business forward and expectations for the U.S. academic market to continue to improve we are expecting steady improvement in our spatial Ella gene growth rate in the coming quarters.\nMoving on to our Molecular Diagnostics division. Let's start with the significant progress our Exosome Diagnostics business delivered in the quarter. The ExoDx prostate or EPI test continued to benefit from increasing traffic to physician office for initial or follow visits, which in turn drove improving diagnostic testing volumes, including PSA test, which is a prerequisite for EPI test. This improving physician office environment, combined with our digital and traditional marketing initiatives drove almost 70% year-over-year ExoDx prostate test volume growth as testing levels broke a quarterly volume record for the second quarter in a row.\nThe Exosome Diagnostics team had a strong presence at the American Urological Association, or AUA, Conference in May, including the presentation of 2 posters as well as 6 in-booth scientific presentations. This was also a great forum to highlight our ongoing partnership with former Baltimore Orioles player, Iron Man Cal Ripken Jr., who remains an ambassador and advocate for the ExoDx prostate test, which was a part of the Cal's own prostate cancer journey.\nSeparately, our Medicare administrative contractor, National Government Services held a public meeting following our request for reconsideration of our local coverage decision, also known as a LCD. As a reminder, we have made significant progress getting the existing LCD to align with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN guidelines, although a few key differences remain. Most importantly, the current LCD that does not reimburse for repeat usage of our ExoDx prostate test or for patients who previously had a negative prostate biopsy.\nIf successful, the reconsidered LCD with removing limitations enabling the use of our ExoDX prostate test as a surveillance tool. We are encouraged following the opening meeting and are looking forward to the issuance of the final LCD.\nContinuing Molecular Diagnostics, Asuragen had a great quarter as demand for its portfolio of genetic carrier screening kits for electro diagnostic control as well as initial traction in Europe drove growth of over 25% in the quarter. In addition to the ongoing geographic expansion, Asuragen has a rich product pipeline, positioning the business for continued growth going forward.\nFinally, our diagnostics reagents business continued its trend of steady growth in the quarter. The return of patients to the doctor's office, the sparkling demand for hematology and clinical chemistry test, which is driving demand for our clinical control and reagents, improving patient office visit trends, a full pipeline and opportunities for additional share gains within our OEM partners set the stage for sustainable growth in our diagnostic reagents business going forward.\nMost of you probably saw the press release issued this morning announcing the planned leadership transition coming in 2 years. Following the conclusion of our fiscal 2024, I plan to retire as the CEO of Bio-Techne and intend to continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. During my tenure, the Board and I have built an incredibly strong bench of talented, results-driven leaders that could serve as potential internal replacements. Over the same time frame, Bio-Techne has grown into a leading life science tools and diagnostics company, and I have no doubt that our accelerating organic growth profile and sector-leading profitability will attract extremely high-caliber external candidates as well.\nThe Board's search for a potential replacement has already begun, and we will update you when there is news to share. One thing is certain. With a team now over 3,000 strong and a product portfolio directly aimed at some of the hottest areas of scientific research and diagnostics, Bio-Techne is positioned to continue to execute our strategic plan during the next 2 years under my leadership and beyond.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThank you, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q4 and fiscal 2022 financial performance for the company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and then give some thoughts on the fiscal year ahead.\nStarting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $2.05 versus $1.88 1 year ago, an increase of 9% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10 or minus 5% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.51 compared to $0.37 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was unrealized losses on our investment in ChemoCentryx in the prior year.\nQ4 revenue was $288.2 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of about 3% to revenue growth.\nFor the full fiscal year 2022, revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 19% on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 1% and acquisitions had a favorable impact of 3%.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 73.2% in the quarter compared to 72.7% in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by favorable business mix and productivity gains, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.\nAdjusted SG&A in Q4 was 27.8% of revenue compared to 25.9% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q4 was 8.1% of revenue compared to 8% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was due to progress we made in the quarter of building the team to position the company for growth going forward, including adding commercial and technical talent.\nThe resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 37.4%, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating margin was approximately in line with the prior year. For the full year fiscal year '22, adjusted operating margin was 38.3%, a decrease of 80 basis points year-over-year.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q4 was $2.2 million, decreasing $0.8 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $255.9 million.\nAfter the quarter, we did draw down approximately $100 million in our existing line of credit for the recently completed Namocell acquisition, which together with higher floating interest rate, is expected to add approximately $1.4 million to our quarterly interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal year '23.\nOther adjusted nonoperating income was $1.3 million for the quarter compared to $0.7 million in expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangement. For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx.\nMoving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 and for the full fiscal year was 21.2%.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $102.7 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $13.6 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $58.8 million in stock buybacks and $12.5 million in dividend. We finished the quarter with 40.7 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur balance sheet finished Q4 in a very strong position with $247 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments, keeping our net debt position negligible at the end of the fiscal year.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $217 million, with reported revenue increasing 13%. Organic growth was set at 16%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 3%.\nWithin this segment, the growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. Our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions increased over 50%, our ProteinSimple branded instruments and consumables increased in the upper teens, and our RUO proteomics research reagents grew in the low teens.\nOperating margin for the Protein Sciences segment, excluding the impact of partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, was 45.5%, a decrease of 170 basis points year-over-year, with favorable volume leverage and productivity gains more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and strategic investments to support future growth.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q4 reported sales were $71.7 million which reported revenue increasing 7%. Organic growth for the segment was 8% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 1% impact. Within this segment, the diagnostics reagents business increased low single digits. In the ACD-branded spatial biology portfolio returned to double-digit growth in the quarter.\nWith a fortified leadership and commercial team, we anticipate improved growth rates in our spatial biology business going forward.\nFor Exosome Diagnostics, revenue increased 40% as prostate cancer test counts increased almost 70% compared to the prior year period, representing the second consecutive quarterly test volume record. We are encouraged with the volume trend and anticipate continued improvement as our marketing strategy and value proposition resonates with physicians, patients and payers.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 15.7%. The segment's operating margin decreased 100 basis points compared with the prior year. The decrease reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage and product mix more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange into a lesser extent, investments to drive future growth.\nIn summary, the growth momentum across our businesses remain strong. Using fiscal year '19 as a pre-COVID baseline, the company's core organic revenue CAGR has been consistently in the low teens in the past couple of years. As our fourth quarter demonstrated, the biopharma end market is still very strong.\nWe are keeping a close watch on the smaller biotech portion of this end market, given the current difficult market conditions to raise new capital funding. However, we see the academic market improving compared to fiscal year '22, and with a fully staffed commercial team now in our spatial biology franchise, we expect our gold standard RNA scale products to further penetrate the academic and biopharma end markets with double-digit growth.\nAdd to this, the rapid growth we are seeing with our EPI test and Asuragen diagnostic kits, and we believe we have many arrows in the quiver that will enable us to at least achieve the same double-digit organic growth rate in fiscal year '23 as our CAGR since fiscal year '19.\nOf course, with foreign exchange rates where they currently stand, we expect a 2% foreign exchange headwind to our reported growth for fiscal year '23. However, this should be partially offset by anticipated 1% contribution in the recently closed Namocell acquisition.\nBoth negative foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Namocell will likely have a negative impact on our full year adjusted operating margin for fiscal year '23 by as much as 150 basis points. The impact on year-over-year margin will be more severe in Q1 and gradually become less of a headwind as the year progresses. By the time we reach the end of fiscal year '23, we expect our core margin improvement to offset these headwinds and finish the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23 with approximately 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Thus, entering fiscal year '24, right on track to achieve 40% adjusted operating margin by our target of fiscal year '26.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over the operator to open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nSenior Director of IR & Corporate Development, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne.\nBefore we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2021 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call.\nThe company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section.\nDuring the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck.\n\nCharles R. Kummeth\n\nCEO, President & Director, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team once again delivered outstanding results across segments and geographies with 17% organic growth, continuing the momentum from the first half of fiscal 2022 into our third quarter. Demand from our biopharma end market remains strong, particularly in cell and gene therapy, where our workflow solutions and GMP proteins continue their fantastic growth trajectory. Other notable growth drivers in the quarter included our biologics instruments as well as our best-in-class portfolio of research reagents and assays.\nAdditionally, our prostate cancer test, ExoDx Prostate had a record volume quarter as the urologist offices continued the reopening process, and we gained increased mindshare in the benefits of this novel diagnostic offering. Once again, this performance was delivered with a focus on profitability, leading to a 130-basis-point sequential increase in our adjusted operating margin of 39.6%.\nOn the human capital front, Bio-Techne received 2 important awards during the third quarter. First, Bio-Techne was selected as one of 500 midsized companies on the Forbes 2022 list of America's Best Employers. Additionally, we were included on the Forbes 2022 list of Best Employers for Diversity. These awards are a testament to the epic culture and workplace we've built at Bio-Techne, and I am proud of the team for these achievements.\nAwards and recognition like these as well as targeting employee recruitment and retention strategies are fortifying our efforts to build the team necessary to support our future growth plans.\nI am pleased to report that we filled several key positions in the company during the quarter, including key business, technical, operational and commercial roles. We are still behind our original hiring plan for the year, but I'm encouraged with the progress we made in the quarter.\nGiven the state of the global supply chain, let me briefly discuss our operations. Once again, the team did an incredible job effectively managing our supply chain. I am pleased to report that we have had -- not had any supply chain-related issues that impact our ability to fulfill our customer orders. Also, we continue to leverage our strategic pricing model across our portfolio to combat inflationary pressures on the business. As you can see from our margin performance in the quarter, these strategies are bearing fruit and we are leveraging our value proposition to offset rising labor and other costs in the business.\nNow let's discuss specifics around our trade performance this quarter, starting with our geographies and end markets. China continued with its banner year, delivering over 30% organic growth in the quarter. This is just tremendous execution by our China commercial team, especially considering the COVID-related lockdowns that took hold late in the quarter in Shanghai. As these lockdowns are still currently being enforced, it is difficult to predict what the temporary impact would be for Q4. The impact of these lockdowns to date are primarily on our recurring research reagent business that is dependent on researchers being at the bench to run experiments. In the end, our China team will persevere, just as they did in the early days of the pandemic 2 years ago when they outperformed all of their peers. And there will likely be a spike of demand when the lockdowns are over and researchers are trying to catch up on their projects. It is also important to mention that we have minimal supply chain and manufacturing exposure in China. So we anticipate any impact on the shutdowns to be isolated to this geography.\nMeanwhile, our growth across the rest of Globe continue to be strong. We experienced robust growth in the U.S., where our business increased in the high teens as well as in Europe where we experienced upper single-digit organic growth. From an end market perspective, Global sales to our biopharma customers remains very strong, increasing nearly 20% for the quarter. Meanwhile, academia, markets started to improve, growing mid-single digit as the latest COVID pandemic wave started to wane, and there was more clarity on NIH funding with the federal budget in place.\nNow let's discuss our growth platforms starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where we grew 16% organically in the quarter. During the quarter, we continued to further our cell and gene therapy strategy as our portfolio of proteomic reagents, technologies and analytical tools continue to deliver the cost-effective solutions needed to push these therapies forward. During the quarter, we increased the number of commercially available GMP proteins manufactured in our state-of-the-art GMP protein manufacturing facility, adding 2 high-quality lot-to-lot consistent GMP proteins with the scale and capacity to meet current and anticipated demand.\nI would also like to highlight the strong performance of our cell culture portfolio, particularly from our Cultrex line of Basement Membrane Extract, BME, Matrix products, which act as scaffolds for the growth of organoid cell structures, induced pluripotent stem cell expansion and other 2D and 3D cell culture applications.\nAll in, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions increased over 40% in the quarter with both GMP proteins and cell culture specifically growing well ahead of this rate. Once again, demand from our cell and gene therapy customers created a halo effect across our portfolio, driving incremental demand of our proteomic analytical tools and spatial biology solutions. We are incredibly well positioned to benefit across our portfolio as research continues in this area and the rich funnel of these next-generation therapies progress through the regulatory approval process.\nNext, I want to provide an update on Wilson Wolf. As a reminder, Wilson Wolf is a manufacturer of the GRx line of single-use devices, which are quickly becoming an industry standard for a fast, easy and cost-effective cell therapy scaling solution. In our second fiscal quarter 2022, we entered into an agreement with Wilson Wolf, where Bio-Techne can make a 20% ownership investment, followed by full acquisition of the company upon achievement of certain milestones. I'm very pleased to report that Wilson Wolf made continued progress in achieving the trailing 12-month $92 million revenue or $55 million EBITDA milestone, which will trigger our initial 20% investment. Wilson Wolf exited the quarter at a $72 million revenue run rate as they continue to execute on their growth plan and approach this important milestone.\nNow let's discuss our core research-use-only or RUO proteomic reagents, including our industry-leading portfolio of RUO proteins and antibodies. Here, our growth was also fantastic with these reagents growing at a 20% in the quarter. Researchers continue to rely on our catalog of over 6,000 R&D systems branded proteins for the highest quality, bioactive and lot-to-lot-consistent proteins on the market. Our R&D Systems and Novus-branded antibodies also continue to deliver the reliable and consistent performance needed by researchers globally and are increasingly being selected as a content to enable the emerging class of next-generation proteomic technologies.\nMoving on to our proteomic analytical tools, which includes our Simple Western, Simple Plex and biologic instruments as well as our leading portfolio of immunoassay solutions. Our ProteinSimple brand instruments and consumables increased mid-teens in the quarter. This growth is particularly impressive considering the prior year comparison where ProteinSimple increased over 50%. Once again, performance of our biological instrument, namely Maurice, led the way increasing over 30% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Maurice is easy-to-use, cartridge-based format, simplifies protein characterization and charge analysis delivering the ideal tool for our biopharma customers.\nThe Maurice results reflect ongoing traction within CRO, CDMO, as well as cell and gene therapy end markets. We believe we are taking share not only from competing systems but also converting accounts from high-performance liquid chromatography, or HPLC, where Maurice offers comparatively higher quality data as well as labor and time savings. Our Simple Western portfolio, our fully automated western blot solutions continues to penetrate the large manual Western blot market opportunity, as the reproduce (inaudible) and time savings value proposition continues to resonate within our end markets. We are also seeing building interest in the platform for applications that go beyond traditional western blotting, including cell and gene therapy, protein degradation and even the support of dose response curve.\nAs a reminder, we introduced the Stellar kits for our Jess Simple Western platform in January. These kits enable the detection of low abundance proteins while multiplexing -- multiple analyze within the same detection lane. In the first partial quarter since launch, Stellar Detection kits surpassed legacy Fluorescent detection kits and contributed to a record quarter for Simple Western consumables.\nWe continue to develop new cell and gene therapy applications for the Simple Plex or Ella multiplexing immunoassay system. For example, Bio-Techne and Cygnus Technologies is a part of Maravai LifeSciences recently announced the launch of the Simple Plex HEK 293 HCP 3G assay for automated process and purity testing on the Ella immunoassay platform. Purification of viral particles to minimize whole cell protein contaminants is a crucial part of the viral production workflow in cell and gene therapy applications. The Ella assay development roadmap remains very full with additional neurological biomarker, cell and gene therapy, bioprocessing and immuno-oncology assays in the pipeline, layer the untapped clinical opportunity onto this rich assay pipeline, we believe Ella remains in the early innings of reaching its potential.\nNow let's discuss the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic growth increased 19% for the quarter. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, remains the largest spatial biology business globally as our highly sensitive biomarker identification technology with single cell detection, resolution and quantification capabilities continues to enable the transition from discovery to translational research. Spatial biology increased upper single digits in the quarter as a soft academic market and a challenging year-over-year comp weighed on performance.\nEncouragingly, we made progress fortifying our North American commercial team with all our one key sales territory now filled. We augmented our commercial efforts with a full slate of conferences, including a presentation at the U.S. and Canadian Academy of Pathology or USCAP Conference as well as the presentation of 2 posters at the American Association for Cancer Research or AACR meeting, and we have a full slate of upcoming conferences, including ASGCT and AGBT.\nWith our sales territories largely occupied and growing presence on the conference circuit to build awareness and expectations for the academic market to improve following NIH budget clarity, we are expecting steady improvement in our spatial biology growth rates in the upcoming quarters.\nMoving on to our Molecular Diagnostics division. Let's start with the significant progress our Exosome Diagnostics business delivered in the quarter. ExoDx Prostate or the EPI test benefited from increasing traffic to the physician office for initial or follow visits, which in turn drove improving diagnostic testing volumes, including PSA test, which is a prerequisite for our EPI test. This improving physician office environment, combined with our digital and traditional marketing initiatives drove over 50% year-over-year for ExoDx Prostate test volume growth as testing levels represented a quarterly record. We have several initiatives in place to build on this momentum, including renewal of our Fight Like Cal marketing campaign with Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr.\nAs a reminder, Cal Ripken Jr. took the EPI test and opted for a biopsy based on its results, enabling the discovery of his aggressive prostate cancer in its early stages. Mr. Ripken will be an active component of our live presentations at the upcoming American Urology Association Conference and our ongoing digital marketing initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to publish data supporting the value ExoDx Prostate delivers to men in their prostate cancer journey. A publication in the World Journal of Urology demonstrated the utility of the ExoDX Prostate test to address limitations related to prostate biopsy sampling year, prostate biopsy bias as well as multifocality of the disease with a study of suggesting that the test can be used in the decision for active surveillance and enabling them to avoid unnecessary radical prostatectomy.\nSeparately, we announced an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to exclusively complete the development and commercialize the ExoTRU kidney transplant rejection assay ExoTRU is a noninvasive, multi-gene, urine-based liquid biopsy assay that provides critical allograft information to assist clinical decision-making in managing kidney transplant patients and optimizing care for these patients.\nFinancial terms of the agreement were not disclosed but include payments for achieving various milestones as well as an ongoing royalty. The first milestone payment related to the successful technology transfer to Thermo Fisher Scientific was achieved in the quarter.\nThe legacy Asuragen portfolio, a leading carrier screening and oncology diagnostic kits, continue to gain market traction, including several evaluations of the recently launched AmplideX CFTR kit enabling broad coverage of the Gene variants Linked to cystic fibrosis.\nAdditionally, we have positioned the business to increase its penetration of the largely untapped European markets, adding to and leveraging our commercial presence in this geography. In addition to the geographic expansion, the Asuragen's pipeline remains full and is positioned for strong growth in the quarters and years to come.\nFinally, our diagnostic reagents business continued its trend of steady growth in the quarter, the return of patients to the doctor's office is sparking demand for hematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry test, which is driving demand for our clinical controls and reagents. Improving patient office visits trends, a full pipeline and opportunities to additional share gains within our OEM partners set the stage for sustainable growth in our diagnostic reagents business going forward.\nIn conclusion, we are incredibly well positioned for the Proteometric evolution that is in the initial stages of unfolding with high demand for our content-rich research reagents and highly sensitive yet, easy -- simple-to-use analytical tools that move our customers' discoveries forward.\nOur cell and gene therapy initiatives continue to resonate with our biopharma customers with increasing demand for our GMP proteins, cell culture media products translating into growth across our entire portfolio.\nGiven Wilson Wolf's current growth trajectory, the pathway to our initial 20% investment stake and eventual acquisition is accelerating. Our diagnostic strategy is gaining momentum as testing volumes continue to improve with the proven ability to find partners that can help drive our next disruptive exosome-based test forward.\nI am proud of the team's Q3 accomplishments and look forward to continued execution against our long-term strategic goals.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was a record $2.14 versus $1.81 a year ago, an increase of 19% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.48 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Q3 revenue was $290.4 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis. Acquisitions had a favorable 3% year-over-year impact and foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 1% to revenue growth.\nFrom a geographic perspective, China led all geographies growing over 30% followed by the U.S. increasing in the upper teens and EMEA increasing in the upper single digits for the quarter. The rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits. By end market, biopharma remained very strong, growing nearly 20%, while academia increased mid-single digits year-over-year.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 73.2% in the quarter compared to 73% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable business mix, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 26.1% of revenue compared to 25.6% in the prior year while R&D expense in Q3 was 7.5% of revenue compared to 7.0% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was due to the acquisition of Asuragen in the fourth quarter of last year as well as investments made to support our long-term strategic growth.\nThe resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 39.6%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year period but an increase of 130 basis points over Q2. Excluding the impact of the Asuragen acquisition made last April and the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $2.2 million, decreasing $0.2 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt. Our bank debt and the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $259 million. Other adjusted net operating expense was $1.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.3 million expense for the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements.\nFor GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx.\nMoving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 21.2%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $73.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $15.1 million. Also during Q3, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $60.8 million in stock buybacks and $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 41 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur balance sheet finished Q3 in a very strong position with $231.2 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments, keeping our net debt position negligible.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $213.2 million with reported revenue increasing 15%. Organic growth for this segment was 16% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 1%. Within this segment, the growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increased over 40%, our RUO proteomics research reagents grew nearly 20% and our ProteinSimple-branded instruments and consumables increased in the mid-teens on very tough comps. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.4%, a decrease of 250 basis points year-over-year with favorable volume leverage more than offset by strategic investments to support future growth and, to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign exchange.\nTurning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $77.7 million, with reported revenue increasing 34%. Organic growth for this segment was 19%, and Asuragen acquisition from last year contributed 15% to growth. Within this segment, the Diagnostics reagents business increased mid-single digits and the ACD-branded spatial biology portfolio delivered upper single-digit growth in the quarter. With increased clarity on academic funding and a sales force that is approaching fully staffed, we anticipate improved growth rates in our Spatial Biology segment going forward.\nFor Exosome Diagnostics revenue growth accelerated as prostate cancer test counts increased over 50% compared to the prior year period, representing a quarterly test volume record. We are encouraged with the volume trend and anticipate continued improvement as our marketing strategy and value proposition resonates with physicians and patients.\nAs Chuck mentioned, we earned an initial milestone payment related to the ExoTRU kidney rejection technology transfer to Thermo Fisher Scientific, which the financial details of our agreement were not disclosed.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Operating margin at 25% -- 25.0%. The segment's operating margin increased 710 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage and product mix, including the milestone payment for ExoTRU.\nIn summary, the growth momentum across our business remains consistently strong. Using fiscal year '19 as a pre-COVID baseline, the company's revenue growth CAGR, excluding the impact of acquisitions, FX and milestone payments has been in the low to mid-teens every quarter for the past 7.\nAs Chuck stated in his closing comments, we believe that we are still in the early stages -- or the initial stages of a proteomics revolution that is ahead of us in the life sciences industry.\nIn our best-in-class research tools and cell and gene therapy enablers are positioned to be leaders in this revolution for years to come. Layer onto this, an emerging Diagnostics and Genomics portfolio that remains in the early stages of realizing its true potential, and we are incredibly well positioned to deliver on our long-term strategic growth objectives.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Maria to open the line for questions.",

Kummeth\n\nCEO, President & Director, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team once again executed our global growth strategy at a high level, continuing the momentum from last quarter and the last fiscal year. We crossed an important milestone during Q2 as our trailing 12-month revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company's 44-year history.\nOur 17% second quarter growth rate reflects continued robust demand for our portfolio of high-quality products and unique analytical solutions, especially within the biopharma end user base. Within biopharma, our positioning with self and gene therapy customers continues to accelerate, with this end market growing north of 80% and our GMP proteins grew over 180%. Our portfolio of innovative reagents, tools and solutions remain incredibly well positioned to enable the biologics revolution currently underway as transformative technologies like cell and gene therapy, facial biology, and genetic and proteomic biomarkers drive research discoveries, the emergence of transformative diagnostics and therapies and ultimately impact better patient care and outcomes.\nI'm extremely proud of our team of scientists that continue to develop innovative technologies necessary to advance and enable next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics.\nThis performance in Q2 was once again delivered with a focus on driving profitability as our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points sequentially to 38.3%. While the demand for human capital remains high and the pace of our own hiring to meet current customer demand and support our future growth programs remains challenging, we continue to make progress in adding talented people to our organization at all levels in each of our businesses.\nDuring the quarter, we filled several key open positions within our technical and commercial organizations. We are utilizing referral bonuses, career fairs as well as leveraging industry awards like our recent recognition in Inc. Magazine's inaugural list of best led companies to attract and retain talent. At the most senior level in our company, I'm very pleased to have Will Everson join our leadership team. Will is our new President of Protein Sciences and most recently served as Chief Operating Officer for Quanterix. Prior to that, will held multiple leadership positions running large business units for Thermo Fisher Scientific. Will transitioning into his new role from Dave Enzer who will be retiring in Q3.\nBrenda is our new Senior Vice President of Human Resources, with extensive experience successfully leading HR functions at large organizations, including 18 years at Apple. Brenda will be transitioning into renew role from Struan Robertson, who will also be retiring in Q3. The contributions of both Dave and Struan have made to the dynamic growth and culture of Bio-Techne over the past 8 years have been immeasurable. And I wish him all the best in the retirement.\nIt is largely due to the legacy created by Dave and Struan and the remainder of Bio-Techne's 2,700 strong employees that has enabled our company to attract such great talent to lead our businesses on to a decade of success.\nNow let's get to some of the specifics around Bio-Techne's spectacular business performance for the quarter, starting with our regions and end markets. We once again experienced global strength across the portfolio. China led all territories where the team delivered yet another quarter of organic growth above 20%. Close behind with the U.S. growth also north of 20% and Europe was in the mid-teens. As I mentioned earlier, this growth was driven by a very strong biopharma market as it has been for many quarters, and we don't see that momentum slowing down.\nSimilar to Q1, academic growth was significantly lower than biopharma, where Omicron-induced do shutdowns occurred over the holidays and lack of funding clarity impacted larger bulk orders. However, our daily run rate reagent demand from academic customers was strong for most of the quarter, indicating a healthy underlying academic research environment. We anticipate this relative lull and academic growth will gradually accelerate the remainder of the calendar year as the Omicron peaks the size and the spending budget is finally passed in Congress.\nNow let's discuss the performance of our growth platforms, starting with Protein Sciences, where we delivered organic growth of 19% in the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we continue to experience broad acceptance of our innovative tools, reagents and analytical solutions to improve the efficiencies within the cell and gene therapy workflow. During the quarter, we initiated commercial availability of GMP proteins, manufactured in our state-of-the-art GMP protein manufacturing site and are now actively shipping to our customers from this facility.\nWe will continue to expand the number of GMP proteins manufactured in this facility, focusing first on scaling the GMP proteins with the highest anticipated demand within our catalog of over 30 GMP protein. However, our cell and gene therapy business extends far beyond GMP proteins and includes serum and media for cell growth, our nonviral gene editing technology as well as our cloud polymer-based cell separation technology. In addition to uptake with our cell, our core cell and gene therapy products, we are experiencing a halo effect on several other Bio-Techne product lines, including our proteomic analytical tools and spatial biology franchises.\nWe also continue to explore external opportunities to expand our cell and gene therapy offering in addition to our organic efforts. In December, we struck an agreement with St. Paul, Minnesota-based Wilson Wolf for a future investment and eventual acquisition of this rapidly growing company. As background, Wilson Wolf manufactures a GRX product line, a leading single-use cell culture device, which has enjoyed rapid adoption and is quickly becoming the cell and gene therapy industry standard for.\nWilson Wolf  is a very synergistic fit with Bio-Techne with GRX cell culture devices requiring GMP proteins is a key input to scale immune cell growth. Terms of the agreement include the right to make a 20% ownership investment upon Wilson Wolf  for each $92 million in trailing 12-month revenue or $55 million in EBITDA. This is followed by an agreement to fully acquire the company upon achieving $226 million in revenue or $136 million in EBITDA for an additional $1 billion, representing a total acquisition price of $1.26 billion.\nIf these milestones are not reached by the end of calendar year 2027, Bio-Techne has the right to purchase Wilson Wolf  at a set multiple of 4.4x trailing 12-month revenue. As a reminder, Wilson Wolf , along with Fresenius Kabi, are already biotech partners in a scale-ready cell and gene therapy joint venture. Today, Wilson Wolf annualized revenue is greater than $50 million and growing rapidly. We are looking forward to them hitting their milestones and eventually becoming official members of the Bio-Techne team.\nWith all the excitement around cell and gene therapy opportunities, we haven't taken our eyes off the ball of the core of our company, RUO proteins and antibodies. Our core research use only protein antibody businesses continued to perform extremely well, growing double digits in the quarter. Our broad catalog of RUO proteins is widely recognized as the industry-leading portfolio with our R&D Systems brand delivering the highest level of quality, bioactivity and lot-to-lot consistency. In fact, we created a category of research use cytokines more than 35 years ago and have amassed a catalog of over 6,000 proteins over this time frame, including several hundred that are exclusive to Bio-Techne.\nOur in-house expertise and broad offering in both proteins antibodies creates opportunities for Bio-Techne to participate broadly in emerging applications, including high-throughput proteomics and the development of engineered proteins and positions us to possibly expand into adjacent opportunities, including mRNA and plasma DNA manufacturing.\nMoving on to our proteomic analytical tools, where the team once again delivered robust growth across our portfolio of novel instruments and leading immunoassay solutions, our ProteinSimple branded instrument portfolio increased 25% as biologics, Simple Western and Simple Plex all grew north of 20% in the quarter. Biologics once again led the way, growing over 30% year-over-year.\nRecall our biologics instruments, namely our Maurice platform, enable the identification, purity testing and charge analysis of proteins and bioprocessing. Maurice is also gaining traction in cell and gene therapy applications with its ability to characterize capsid proteins enabling AAV serotype identity and stability testing. Our fully automated Western blotting solution, Simple Western continues to gain acceptance within the research community as its ability to convert the messy, cumbersome and unreliable process of a manual western blood into a 3-hour highly accurate push button process and continues to resonate, particularly with our biopharma customers.\nSimple Western is also gaining significant traction on gene therapy applications with stem cell therapy, regenerative medicine, gene-modified cell therapy and gene therapy customers all using Simple Western for viral vector identification, purity testing, an empty versus full capsid detection. The recent launch of the stellar NIR IR detection models for our just Simple Western system is a great example of enhancements we continue to deliver on this platform.\nStellar fluorescence modules enable the detection of low abundance proteins and the multiplexing of multiple targets, including multicolor immunoassays alongside total protein staining within the same detection lane. Following the commercial availability of Stellar modules, just now offers low picogram sensitivity in both chemical luminescence and fluorescence channels.\nFor SimplePlex, for Ella, we are also experiencing increased demand in the cell and gene therapy applications with the instrument increasingly being used to detect wholesale-related impurities. The ELA assay development road map remains very full with additional neurological biomarkers, cell and gene therapy, bioprocessing and immuno-oncology assays in the pipeline, layer the untapped clinical opportunity onto this rich assay pipeline, and we believe Ella remains in the early stages of reaching its potential.\nNow let's discuss the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue increased 6% for the quarter. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, increased 10% in the quarter. While this growth is not up to our long-term expectations, it was a nice improvement over Q1, which was impacted by key open commercial positions, a higher exposure to a softer academic market and a tougher year-over-year comp. All those same headwinds remain in Q2. However, we did make progress in filling some of the open commercial positions and expect for continued progress in growth rates as new commercial team members on board and the academic environment improves.\nAs a reminder, over recent quarters, we have expanded our spatial biology portfolio beyond RNA scope, adding kits for the visualization and quantification of DNA, microRNA, short RNA targets as well as higher plexing RNA capabilities. We are also very encouraged with the continued market traction we are experiencing with basic, a kit for the detection of short RNA targets, 50 to 300 basis, enabling the detection of splice variance to circular RNA and gene fusion.\nOur menu of probes is now greater than 50,000 targets over many species and publications that have almost crossed 5,500, demonstrating the growing interest in this platform. Cell and gene therapy has also been a new market for our spatial biology business with ACD being used to track genes of interest in the cellular environment and determine the quantity of gene uptake in therapeutic cells.\nWe recently announced a nonexclusive partnership with fellow spatial biology company, Akoya Biosciences, pairing our RNA scope HiPlex V2 assay for RNA imaging with Akoya's protein imaging assays to run on Akoya's phenocyclar fusion system. This single cell spatial multiomic workflow has potential to accelerate scientific understanding of human health and complex diseases like cancer, unlock new biomarker diagnostic signatures, improve patient stratification and ultimately improve treatment outcomes. We are excited about the automation of the RNAscope HiPlex V2 assay enabled by the Akoya partnership.\nMoving on to other parts of our diagnostics and genomics portfolio within our molecular diagnostics division. Our ExoDx prostate cancer test continued to make progress in the quarter as patients returning to the doctors for routine checkups or followers led to a strong improvement in diagnostic testing volumes. Q2 test volumes for ExoDx prostate cancer test returned to pre-pandemic volumes and have continued to increase year-over-year by strong double digits as we begin Q3. In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative exosome-based diagnostic tests, including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, EkoTruKidney.\nAs a reminder, is a noninvasive multigene urine-based liquid biopsy assay that provides critical allograft health information to assist clinician decision-making in managing kidney transplant patients in optimizing patient care. We continue to work a dual pathway for the commercial launch, focusing on discussions with potential commercial partners and taking steps to prepare for potential commercialization on our own.\nWith regards to the products with from the legacy surgeon business, our leading portfolio of genetic and oncology molecular diagnostic products, including our kits for FMR1 and continue to gain market traction. During the quarter, we strengthened our genetic kit offering with the launch of the AMPODEX-PCRC-CFTR kit. Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the CFTR gene. This research-use-only kit provides broader coverage of the diverse U.S. population than any other commercially available targeted CFTR testing assay.\nFinally, our Diagnostics Reagents business delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of growth, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. The pandemic-related headwinds that impacted this business in recent quarters continue to diminish, and we are experiencing a reacceleration in the chemistry, blood gas and hematology control product lines.\nImproving doctor office visit trends and the resulting diagnostic test volumes, combined with new product launches and additional penetration within existing OEM customers, position this business for sustainable growth going forward.\nIn conclusion, the favorable trends we experienced in recent quarters continued in our Q2 as execution from the global team, favorable make conditions and robust demand for our portfolio proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and molecular diagnostic products remain strong. Our cell and gene therapy initiatives are resonating with our biopharma customers. There's increasing demand for our GMP proteins, cell culture and products are translating into demand across our portfolio, particularly for our protein simple branded proteomic and analytical solutions. We have our sights firmly focused on hitting our $2 billion 2026 revenue target and following the signing of the Wilson Wolf purchase agreement I'm even more confident in our ability to deliver and potentially exceed this goal.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Jim.\n\nJames T. Hippel\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Bio-Techne Corporation\n\nThanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal '22 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year.\nStarting with the overall second quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was a record $1.88 versus $1.62 1 year ago, an increase of 16% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.04.\nGAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.94 compared to $1.15 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS other than from business operations was unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx.\nQ2 revenue was $269.3 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis. Acquisitions contributed 3%, and foreign exchange translation had an immaterial impact to revenue growth.\nFrom a geographic perspective, we experienced a strong and balanced performance with China and the U.S. growing over 20% and EMEA increasing in the mid-teens for the quarter. The rest of the world grew in the upper single digits. By end market, biopharma remained very strong, growing 30%, while Academia increased low single digits year-over-year.\nMoving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.3% in the quarter compared to 71.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by volume leverage and favorable segment mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 26.5% of revenue compared to 25.2% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 7.5% of revenue, in line with the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was due to the acquisition of Asuragen in the fourth quarter of last year as well as investments made to support our long-term strategic growth.\nThe resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 38.3%, an increase of -- I'm sorry, a decrease of 50 basis points from the prior year period but an increase of 50 basis points over Q1. Excluding the impact of the Asuragen acquisition made last April, adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year.\nLooking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $2.6 million, decreasing $0.8 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at $282.1 million.\nOther adjusted nonoperating expense was $1.9 million for the quarter compared to $1.3 million expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx.\nFurther down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 21.4%.\nTurning to cash flow and return of capital. $101 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter compared to $89.3 million in the prior year quarter. In Q2, our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.2 million, and during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $41.3 million in stock buybacks and $12.6 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 41.2 million average diluted shares outstanding.\nOur balance sheet finished Q2 in a very strong position with $279 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments, bringing our net debt position to near zero.\nNext, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $205 million, with reported inorganic revenue, both increasing 19% compared to the prior year. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increased almost 80%, including growth of over 180% in our GMP protein products, while Biologics grew over 30%, Simple Western and Simple Plex both increased over 20% and proteins and antibodies all grew low double digits.\nOperating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.5%, a decrease of 120 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage more than offset by the timing of strategic investments to support future growth.\nTurning to Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q2 reported sales were $64.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 23%. Organic growth for the segment was 7%, with acquisitions contributing another 16%. The Diagnostics Reagents business increased upper single digits, and the ACD-branded spatial biology portfolio improved sequentially, achieving double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter.\nFor Exosome Diagnostics revenue growth was hampered by the timing of companion diagnostic projects with big pharma, but importantly, prostate cancer test counts improved almost 30% compared to the prior year period, now surpassing pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged with the volume trend and anticipate continued improvement as patients return to their physicians for checkups and our sales force gets more in-person interaction with the physician community.\nMoving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin. At 16.9%, the segment's operating margin increased 140 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage and product mix, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments to support future growth.\nIn summary, our research-oriented end markets remain strong and the diagnostics end market continues to improve. As our Q2 performance shows, our research reagents and analytic tools remain in high demand, and we are executing extremely well in serving these markets. Our comps become increasingly more challenging in the second half of this fiscal year as they reflect the massive rebound that occurred last year from the COVID lows the year before. However, given our strong performance during the first half of our fiscal '22, we have increasing confidence that we can achieve an overall organic growth rate in the mid-teens for the full fiscal 2022.\nThat concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lisa to open the line for questions.",

We had an excellent quarter of operating performance and remain confident in the long-term direction and strategy of our insurance business. We also reported very strong investment income growth in the third quarter of this year, with ongoing benefits from rebalancing our investment portfolio in the second half of last year. Net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2025 included recognition of $675 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $449 million for the third quarter more than doubled the third quarter from a year ago. Our 88.2% third quarter 2025 property casualty combined ratio improved by 9.2 percentage points compared with third quarter last year, including a decrease of 9.3 points for catastrophe losses. The 84.7% accident year 2025 combined ratio before catastrophe losses for the third quarter improved by 2.1 percentage points compared with accident year 2024. Although the pace of growth slowed, our consolidated property casualty net written premiums still grew at a healthy 9% for the quarter.\nOur underwriters continue to emphasize pricing and risk segmentation on a policy-by-policy basis in their underwriting decisions. Estimated average renewal price increases for most lines of business during the third quarter were lower than the second quarter of 2025, but still at a level we believe was healthy. Commercial Lines in total average increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines was again in the high single-digit range.\nOur Personal Lines segment included homeowner in the low double-digit range in personal auto in the high single-digit range. Additional support for our premium growth objectives includes outstanding claims service and strong relationships with independent insurance agents who enthusiastically partner with us.\nNext, I'll highlight third quarter performance by Insurance segment compared with a year ago. In addition to premium growth, underwriting profitability for each area was excellent. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 5% with a 91.1% combined ratio that improved by 1.9 percentage points, including 2.8 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 14%, including growth in middle market accounts and Cincinnati Private Client. Its combined ratio was 88.2%, 22.1 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 19.5 points from lower catastrophe losses.\nExcess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 11% and produced a combined ratio of 89.8%, an improvement of 5.5 percentage points. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each had an outstanding quarter and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati Re, third quarter 2025 net written premiums decreased by 2%, primarily due to changing conditions in the property market. Its combined ratio was 80.8%. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 61.2%, along with premium growth of 6% as it continues to benefit from product expansion in recent years.\nOur life insurance subsidiary had another strong quarter, including 40% net income growth. In addition, term life insurance earned premiums grew 5%. I'll end my comments with a summary of our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our VCR was 8.9% for the third quarter of 2025. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 3.1%. Higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 5.8%.\nNow I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, for additional insights regarding our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We reported growth of 14% in investment income in the third quarter of '25, reflecting efforts during 2024 to rebalance our investment portfolio in addition to strong cash flow from insurance operations. Bond interest income grew 21% and net purchases of fixed maturity securities totaled $232 million for the quarter and $944 million for the first 9 months of this year.\nThe third quarter pretax average yield of 5.10% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 30 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of this year was 5.52%. Dividend income was up 1% and net purchases of equity securities totaled $57 million for the quarter and $118 million on a year-to-date basis. Valuation changes in aggregate for the third quarter were favorable for both our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio.\nBefore tax effects, the net gain was $846 million for the equity portfolio and $242 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $8.2 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $8.4 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $217 million.\nCash flow, in addition to higher bond yields, contributed to investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2025 was $2.2 billion, up 8%. Turning to expense management. Our third quarter 2025 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 0.5 percentage points, primarily due to growth in earned premiums outpacing growth and expenses. For loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nAs we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. We then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first 9 months of 2025, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.1 billion, including $900 million for the IBNR portion.\nDuring the third quarter, we experienced $22 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 0.9 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net favorable reserve development for the first 9 months of '25 on totaled $176 million, including favorable $236 million for '24, favorable $16 million for '23 and an unfavorable $76 million in aggregate for accident years prior to '23.\nI'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights. We paid $134 million in dividends to shareholders during the third quarter of 2025. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 404,000 shares at an average price per share of $149.75. We believe both our financial flexibility and our financial strength are in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end was $5.5 billion. Debt to total capital remained under 10%.\nOn October 10, we terminated our existing $300 million line of credit agreement that was set to expire on February 4, 2026 and entered into a new $400 million unsecured revolving credit agreement. This new agreement has a 5-year term with 2 optional 1-year extensions and is fully subscribed among our 4 lenders. Our quarter end book value was a record high $98.76 per share, with $15.4 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity providing ample capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. I think this quarter's strong results demonstrate that we have the people and plans in place to keep building on our success. Our associates continue to answer the call for our agents and the communities they serve, building strong relationships and informing smart underwriting decisions. In September, Fitch Ratings recognized our decade of delivering profitability and growth by upgrading our insurer financial strength ratings for all of our standard market property casualty and life insurance subsidiaries to AA-, very strong from A+, all with a stable outlook.\nAs our 75th anniversary celebration winds down, we are looking ahead to the future, and we are excited by the opportunities we see to keep living the golden rule, meeting the evolving needs of agents and policyholders and creating value for shareholders. I'll also note that Senior Vice President, Andy Schnell, is on the call and will be in future quarters. Following Theresa Hoffer's retirement, Andy joined Cincinnati Insurance 23 years ago and has worked his way up the accounting ranks, proving his business acumen and his leadership abilities. He, Theresa and Mike, all work closely over the past year to ensure a smooth transition that maintained our consistent accounting processes and procedures.\nAs a reminder, with Andy, Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Solaria and Marc Schambow. Chloe, please open the call for questions."

I'm pleased to report strong operating performance. Because we are confident in the long-term direction and strategy of our insurance business, we didn't lose focus after the California wildfires early in the year.\nWe stayed anchored to our agent-centered strategy continuing to balance profitability and growth. We also continue to benefit from rebalancing our investment portfolio in the second half of last year. and reported very strong investment income growth in the second quarter of this year. Our commercial lines in excess and surplus lines insurance segments again produced combined ratios below 93%.\nSecond quarter 2025 results for Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also outstanding, each with a combined ratio below 85%. Spring and summer storms added 23.8 percentage points to our Personal Lines combined ratio and its combined ratio was still just 2 percentage points shy of an underwriting profit for the quarter.\nThe second half of the year is typically more profitable for our personal lines business. Over the past 5 years, we've seen an average improvement of 8 points in the second half of the year for that segment. Net income of $685 million for the second quarter of 2025 more than doubled our result from a year ago and included recognition of $380 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $311 million for the second quarter was up 52%. Our 94.9% second quarter 2025 property casualty combined ratio improved by 3.6 percentage points compared with second quarter last year, despite a 1 point increase in catastrophe losses. The 85.1% accident year 2025 combined ratio before catastrophe losses for the second quarter improved by 3.1 percentage points compared with accident year 2024.\nOur consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 11% for the quarter, including 16% growth in agency renewal premiums. New business written premiums continued to grow in our commercial and excess and surplus line segments. However, they decreased by $22 million in our Personal Lines segment, in part from a $13 million reduction in California as we slowed growth in some parts of that state.\nSteady premium growth and reinsurance market opportunities prompted us to add and an additional layer of $300 million on top of our property catastrophe reinsurance program, expanded coverage totaling $129 million or 43% of the layer was placed with reinsurers for an estimated ceded premium cost of less than $5 million.\nWe continue to focus on our profitable premium growth objectives that are supported by various efforts, including superior claims service and fostering relationships with the best independent insurance agents in our industry. Our underwriters excel in pricing and risk segmentation on a policy-by-policy basis as they make risk selection decisions. Combining that with average price increases should help us continue to improve our underwriting profitability.\nEstimated average renewal price increases for most lines of business during the second quarter were lower than the first quarter of 2025, but still at a level we believe was healthy. Commercial lines in total average increases near the high end of the mid-single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines was again in the high single-digit range.\nOur personal lines segment included homeowner in the low double-digit range and personal auto in the high single-digit range.\nMoving on to highlight second quarter performance by Insurance segment. I'll note premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 9% with an excellent 92.9% combined ratio that improved by 6.2 percentage points including 2.3 points from lower catastrophe losses.\nPersonal Lines grew net written premiums 20%, including growth in middle market accounts and Cincinnati Private Clients. Its combined ratio was 102%, 4.9 percentage points better than last year despite an increase of 2.9 points from higher catastrophe losses.\nExcess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 12% with a nice profit margin. That segment produced a combined ratio of 91.1%, an improvement of 4.3 percentage points. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each had an outstanding quarter and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati Re second quarter 2025 net written premiums decreased by 21%, reflecting pricing discipline where market conditions softened. Its combined ratio was 82.8%.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was 78.4%, along with premium growth of 45% as it continues to benefit from product expansion in recent years. Our life insurance subsidiary had another strong quarter, including 8% net income growth. In addition, term life insurance earned premiums grew 3%.\nI'll end my commentary with a summary of our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our VCR was 5.2% for the second quarter of 2025. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 2.3%. Higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 2.9%.\nNow I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, for additional insights regarding our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We reported excellent 18% growth in investment income in the second quarter of '25, reflecting efforts during 2024 to rebalance our investment portfolio.\nBond interest income grew 24%, and net purchases of fixed maturity securities totaled $492 million for the quarter, and $712 million for the first 6 months of this year. The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.3% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 29 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of this year was 5.82%.\nDividend income was up 1%, and net purchases of equity securities totaled $56 million for the quarter and $61 million on a year-to-date basis. Valuation changes in aggregate for the second quarter were favorable for both our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio. Before tax effects the net gain was $480 million for the equity portfolio and $16 million for the bond portfolio.\nAt the end of the second quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $7.2 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.6 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $458 million.\nCash flow, in addition to higher bond yields contributed to investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2025 was $1.1 billion. That's down $44 million from a year ago due to paying $442 million more for catastrophe losses in the first half of this year.\nAs usual, I'll briefly comment on expense management and our efforts to balance expense control with strategic business investments. The second quarter of 2025 property casualty underwriting expense ratio decreased by 1.8 percentage points, primarily due to growth in earned premiums outpacing the growth in expenses.\nThe 28.6% expense ratio contributed to strong results for the quarter, but I don't expect it to remain that low in the short term. There are several factors such as the magnitude and timing of various expenses that can cause variation between quarters. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nAs we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first 6 months of 2025, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $829 million, including $711 million for the IBNR portion.\nDuring the second quarter, we experienced $63 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.6 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net favorable reserve development for the first 6 months of '25, totaled $154 million, including a favorable $183 million for '24, favorable $12 million for '23 and an unfavorable $41 million in aggregate for accident years prior to '23.\nI'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights. We paid $133 million in dividends to shareholders during the second quarter of 2025. No shares were repurchased during the quarter. We believe both our financial flexibility and our financial strength are stellar. The parent company cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion.\nDebt to total capital remained under 10%. And our quarter end book value was a record high $91.46 per share, with $14.3 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity, providing ample capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. We're continuing to follow the same bold vision our founders created 75 years ago, a company built for independent agents, doing business face-to-face, handling claims fast, fair and with empathy. Having expertise and financial strength to grow through all market cycles. It had value in 1950, it has value today, and I'm confident it will have value for decades to come.\nAs we've been celebrating our anniversary, we've also been recognizing the many associates who contributed to our success. I want to take a moment to thank one of them now. Theresa Hoffer, will retire in September after 45 years of service. Her remarkable career includes joining our company as a clerical associate, earning an undergraduate and graduate degree in the evenings and then advancing through the finance ranks to become an Executive Officer and Treasurer for some of our insurance subsidiaries.\nHer hard work and dedication have have benefited all of us. Thank you, Theresa, for your many years of leadership and friendship. We wish you all the best in this next chapter of your life. As a reminder, with Theresa, Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Solaria and Mark Shambo.\nDolan please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello, this is Dennis McDaniel of Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, investors.cinfin.com. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results section near the middle of the Investor Overview page.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Spray; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Chairman, Steve Johnston; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nPlease note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. The first quarter of 2025 had its share of challenges from the wildfires in California to freezing and flooding across the planes, to wind and water in the Midwest and East Coast. Almost every area of the country was impacted by a weather-related catastrophe this quarter. While catastrophe losses can dampen earnings on a short-term basis, we know they present an opportunity for our claims service to shine and reinforce the noble purpose of our business.\nOur claims professionals again demonstrated the value of a Cincinnati policy by helping policyholders recover from damaged homes and businesses. I'm proud of the way they have responded with prompt and personal service and handling each claim with care and empathy. The effects of these catastrophes offset otherwise profitable results from our insurance operations and strong investment income that continued to grow at a double-digit percentage pace.\nAs I look deeper into our results for the quarter, I see several areas of strong performance. I remain confident in our long-term plans and our ability to execute on our proven strategy. In addition to growing investment income, property casualty premiums continued to increase at a nice pace and included strong renewal pricing. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment produced a superb combined ratio of 91.9%, continuing its steady improvement over the past 3 years.\nOur excess and surplus lines also had an outstanding quarter, including a combined ratio below 90%. In terms of consolidated results on our income statement, we reported a net loss of $90 million for the first quarter of 2025, including recognition of $56 million on an after-tax basis for the decrease in fair value of equity securities still held. It also included a non-GAAP operating loss of $37 million, a swing of $309 million from a year ago.\nThe change was driven by a $356 million increase in after-tax catastrophe losses. Our 113.3% first quarter 2025 property casualty combined ratio was 19.7 percentage points higher than the first quarter of last year, including an increase of 19.1 points for catastrophe losses. Our 90.5% accident year 2025 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.6 percentage points compared with accident year 2024 for the first quarter. Without the effects of reduced premiums from reinstating reinsurance treaties related to the California wildfires, it would have improved an additional 2 percentage points.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, our catastrophe reinsurance program responded as intended for a large event. The estimated first quarter recovery from our primary property catastrophe reinsurance treaty for the wildfires was $429 million based on our estimate of gross losses at the end of the quarter. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 11% for the quarter, including 14% growth in agency renewal premiums and 11% in new business premiums.\nWe were satisfied with premium growth for the quarter, even with the unfavorable effect of the reinstatement premiums for our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Our estimate of the net effect of all these statement premiums reduced first quarter 2025 premiums by $52 million, slowing growth of consolidated property casualty net written premiums by about 2 percentage points.\nOur objective is profitable premium growth, and it is supported by various efforts. Our underwriters focus on pricing and risk segmentation on a policy-by-policy basis as they make risk selection decisions. Combining that with average price increases should help us continue to improve our underwriting profitability. Estimated average renewal price increases for most lines of business during the first quarter were slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2024.\nCommercial Lines in total remained near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines remain near the high end of that range. Our Personal Lines segment included both personal auto and homeowner in the low double-digit range with personal auto approaching the low end of that range. New business produced by agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance again contributed to premium growth. We continue a healthy pace of appointing agencies where we identify appropriate expansion opportunities consistent with our long-term growth strategy.\nI'll briefly comment on performance by Insurance segment, highlighting premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 8% with an excellent 91.9% combined ratio that improved by 4.6 percentage points, including 2.6 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 13%, including growth in middle market accounts and Cincinnati Private Client. Its combined ratio was 151.3%, 57.4 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to an increase of 49.9 points from higher catastrophe losses.\nIn addition, the effect of reinstatement premiums added approximately 8 points to the combined ratio before catastrophe losses. The $64 million of reinstatement premiums included $63 million for our homeowner line of business and reduced Personal Lines premium growth by 11 full points.\nExcess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 15% with a very profitable combined ratio of 88.3%, an improvement of 3.6 percentage points compared with a year ago. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global experienced significant impacts from the California wildfires this quarter, resulting in an underwriting loss for Cincinnati Re and reducing Cincinnati Global's underwriting profit. Cincinnati Re grew first quarter 2025 net written premiums 26%, including an estimated favorable 6 percentage points from the $12 million net effect of reinstatement premiums related to the wildfires. It had 137.4% combined ratio, which included 63.9 percentage points from catastrophe losses. The $103 million of catastrophe losses, Cincinnati Re reported for the quarter included $104 million for the wildfires.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was 95.8% for the first quarter, 26 percentage points higher than last year, driven by an increase of 23.4 points from higher catastrophe losses, including $20 million for the wildfires. Its net written premiums decreased 9% from a year ago due to lower direct and facultative property premiums reflecting underwriting discipline in the face of a softening market.\nOur life insurance subsidiary continued to help temper earnings volatility that can occur in the property casualty industry with its 11% improvement in net income while growing earned premiums by 1%.\nI'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our first quarter 2025 VCR was negative 0.5%. While that is a disappointing short-term result, it's important to remember that we've always emphasized that performance over the long term is the main focus of this measure. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed negative 0.3%, slightly lower overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed negative 0.2%.\nNext, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight some additional aspects of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued this quarter, up 14% compared with the first quarter of '24. Bond interest income grew 24% and net purchases of fixed maturity securities totaled $220 million for the first 3 months of the year. The first quarter pretax average yield of 4.92% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 27 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter this year was 5.8%.\nDividend income was down 7%, reflecting previously disclosed rebalancing of our investment portfolio during 2024. Valuation changes in aggregate for the first quarter were unfavorable for our equity portfolio and favorable for the bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net loss was $72 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net gain of $65 million to the bond portfolio.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.2 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $486 million. Cash flow, in addition to higher bond yields, again, boosted investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2025 was $310 million, even after paying for most of the largest catastrophe event in our history.\nI'll briefly touch on expense management and our efforts to balance expense control with strategic business investments. The first quarter of 2025 property casualty underwriting expense ratio increased of 0.2 percentage points was primarily due to the effect of reinstatement premiums that added 0.7 points. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nAs we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. We then update estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first 3 months of 2025, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $488 million, including $454 million for the IBNR portion.\nDuring the first quarter, we experienced $91 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 4 percentage points. For our commercial casualty line of business, there was no material reserve development for any prior accident year during the quarter.\nOn an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of '25 included favorable $105 million for '24, favorable $9 million for '23 and an unfavorable $23 million in aggregate for accident years prior to '23.\nI'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights. We paid $125 million in dividends to shareholders during the first quarter of 2025. We also repurchased 300,000 shares at an average price per share of $139.96. We believe our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end was $5 billion. Debt to total capital remained under 10%, and our quarter end book value was $87.78 per share with nearly $14 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity, providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Despite a bumpy first quarter, we remain optimistic about the future of Cincinnati Financial. We're focused on our long-term strategies and are not swayed by short-term volatility. Looking beyond the catastrophes that impacted our business this quarter, we continue to see steady improvement in key metrics we use to evaluate the core of our book.\nOur confidence is reinforced by what we hear from our appointed agencies as we meet with them at our annual sales meetings around the country. Agents are enthusiastic about their business and how we partner with them to serve their clients for our mutual success. We'll continue to focus on the execution of our proven strategy, seeking profitable growth and creating shareholder value over time.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Doran, please open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Corporation First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello, this is Dennis McDaniel of Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, investors.cinfin.com. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results section near the middle of the Investor Overview page.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Spray; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Chairman, Steve Johnston; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nPlease note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. The first quarter of 2025 had its share of challenges from the wildfires in California to freezing and flooding across the planes, to wind and water in the Midwest and East Coast. Almost every area of the country was impacted by a weather-related catastrophe this quarter. While catastrophe losses can dampen earnings on a short-term basis, we know they present an opportunity for our claims service to shine and reinforce the noble purpose of our business.\nOur claims professionals again demonstrated the value of a Cincinnati policy by helping policyholders recover from damaged homes and businesses. I'm proud of the way they have responded with prompt and personal service and handling each claim with care and empathy. The effects of these catastrophes offset otherwise profitable results from our insurance operations and strong investment income that continued to grow at a double-digit percentage pace.\nAs I look deeper into our results for the quarter, I see several areas of strong performance. I remain confident in our long-term plans and our ability to execute on our proven strategy. In addition to growing investment income, property casualty premiums continued to increase at a nice pace and included strong renewal pricing. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment produced a superb combined ratio of 91.9%, continuing its steady improvement over the past 3 years.\nOur excess and surplus lines also had an outstanding quarter, including a combined ratio below 90%. In terms of consolidated results on our income statement, we reported a net loss of $90 million for the first quarter of 2025, including recognition of $56 million on an after-tax basis for the decrease in fair value of equity securities still held. It also included a non-GAAP operating loss of $37 million, a swing of $309 million from a year ago.\nThe change was driven by a $356 million increase in after-tax catastrophe losses. Our 113.3% first quarter 2025 property casualty combined ratio was 19.7 percentage points higher than the first quarter of last year, including an increase of 19.1 points for catastrophe losses. Our 90.5% accident year 2025 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.6 percentage points compared with accident year 2024 for the first quarter. Without the effects of reduced premiums from reinstating reinsurance treaties related to the California wildfires, it would have improved an additional 2 percentage points.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, our catastrophe reinsurance program responded as intended for a large event. The estimated first quarter recovery from our primary property catastrophe reinsurance treaty for the wildfires was $429 million based on our estimate of gross losses at the end of the quarter. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 11% for the quarter, including 14% growth in agency renewal premiums and 11% in new business premiums.\nWe were satisfied with premium growth for the quarter, even with the unfavorable effect of the reinstatement premiums for our property catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Our estimate of the net effect of all these statement premiums reduced first quarter 2025 premiums by $52 million, slowing growth of consolidated property casualty net written premiums by about 2 percentage points.\nOur objective is profitable premium growth, and it is supported by various efforts. Our underwriters focus on pricing and risk segmentation on a policy-by-policy basis as they make risk selection decisions. Combining that with average price increases should help us continue to improve our underwriting profitability. Estimated average renewal price increases for most lines of business during the first quarter were slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2024.\nCommercial Lines in total remained near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines remain near the high end of that range. Our Personal Lines segment included both personal auto and homeowner in the low double-digit range with personal auto approaching the low end of that range. New business produced by agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance again contributed to premium growth. We continue a healthy pace of appointing agencies where we identify appropriate expansion opportunities consistent with our long-term growth strategy.\nI'll briefly comment on performance by Insurance segment, highlighting premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 8% with an excellent 91.9% combined ratio that improved by 4.6 percentage points, including 2.6 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 13%, including growth in middle market accounts and Cincinnati Private Client. Its combined ratio was 151.3%, 57.4 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to an increase of 49.9 points from higher catastrophe losses.\nIn addition, the effect of reinstatement premiums added approximately 8 points to the combined ratio before catastrophe losses. The $64 million of reinstatement premiums included $63 million for our homeowner line of business and reduced Personal Lines premium growth by 11 full points.\nExcess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 15% with a very profitable combined ratio of 88.3%, an improvement of 3.6 percentage points compared with a year ago. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global experienced significant impacts from the California wildfires this quarter, resulting in an underwriting loss for Cincinnati Re and reducing Cincinnati Global's underwriting profit. Cincinnati Re grew first quarter 2025 net written premiums 26%, including an estimated favorable 6 percentage points from the $12 million net effect of reinstatement premiums related to the wildfires. It had 137.4% combined ratio, which included 63.9 percentage points from catastrophe losses. The $103 million of catastrophe losses, Cincinnati Re reported for the quarter included $104 million for the wildfires.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was 95.8% for the first quarter, 26 percentage points higher than last year, driven by an increase of 23.4 points from higher catastrophe losses, including $20 million for the wildfires. Its net written premiums decreased 9% from a year ago due to lower direct and facultative property premiums reflecting underwriting discipline in the face of a softening market.\nOur life insurance subsidiary continued to help temper earnings volatility that can occur in the property casualty industry with its 11% improvement in net income while growing earned premiums by 1%.\nI'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our first quarter 2025 VCR was negative 0.5%. While that is a disappointing short-term result, it's important to remember that we've always emphasized that performance over the long term is the main focus of this measure. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed negative 0.3%, slightly lower overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed negative 0.2%.\nNext, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight some additional aspects of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued this quarter, up 14% compared with the first quarter of '24. Bond interest income grew 24% and net purchases of fixed maturity securities totaled $220 million for the first 3 months of the year. The first quarter pretax average yield of 4.92% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 27 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter this year was 5.8%.\nDividend income was down 7%, reflecting previously disclosed rebalancing of our investment portfolio during 2024. Valuation changes in aggregate for the first quarter were unfavorable for our equity portfolio and favorable for the bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net loss was $72 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net gain of $65 million to the bond portfolio.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.2 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $486 million. Cash flow, in addition to higher bond yields, again, boosted investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2025 was $310 million, even after paying for most of the largest catastrophe event in our history.\nI'll briefly touch on expense management and our efforts to balance expense control with strategic business investments. The first quarter of 2025 property casualty underwriting expense ratio increased of 0.2 percentage points was primarily due to the effect of reinstatement premiums that added 0.7 points. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nAs we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves.

For the first 3 months of 2025, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $488 million, including $454 million for the IBNR portion.\nDuring the first quarter, we experienced $91 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 4 percentage points. For our commercial casualty line of business, there was no material reserve development for any prior accident year during the quarter.\nOn an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of '25 included favorable $105 million for '24, favorable $9 million for '23 and an unfavorable $23 million in aggregate for accident years prior to '23.\nI'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights. We paid $125 million in dividends to shareholders during the first quarter of 2025. We also repurchased 300,000 shares at an average price per share of $139.96.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel, Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, investors.cinfin.com. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results section near the middle of the Investor Overview page.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Spray; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell.

These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Our hearts go out to those impacted by the L.A. wildfires. You've lost homes, treasure belongings, a sense of community, and in the most devastating cases, loved one. I also want to thank the first responders who put their lives on the line, our agents for their support and partnership and of course, our claims associates who are working tirelessly to help our policyholders with immediate needs and longer-term plans.\nBefore I share more details about our current estimate for this catastrophe, let's dive into how we performed last year. Operating performance for the fourth quarter was very strong and many key areas showed improvements. We are also pleased with performance for full year 2024, thanks to the superb work of our associates providing service to agents who we consider to be the best in the insurance business.\nOur fourth quarter results compared to the same period last year included a better combined ratio and excellent growth in premiums and investment income. The result boosted net income, and we had double-digit growth in operating income. Net income was $405 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 and included recognition of $107 million on an after-tax basis for the decrease in fair value of equity securities still held, an unfavorable swing of $931 million from the same period a year ago. Net income for the year rose 24%.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased 38% to $497 million and rose 26% for full year 2024. Our 84.7% fourth quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 2.8 percentage points better than a year ago. It brought the full year combined ratio to an outstanding 93.4%, 1.5 points better than 2023. The full year improvement included a catastrophe loss ratio effect only 0.2 points lower. Our 86.5% accident year 2024 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 1.9 percentage points compared with accident year 2023, including 5 points of improvement for the fourth quarter.\nWe reported another quarter of strong premium growth, which we believe its profitable growth as our underwriters diligently use pricing precision tools to support their risk segmentation efforts on a policy-by-policy basis. Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter of 2024. Commercial lines moved slightly lower in the high single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines remained in the high single-digit range. Our personal lines segment was also similar to the third quarter with personal auto in the low double-digit range and homeowner in the high single-digit range.\nNew business growth produced by agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance continued at a nice pace. Nearly 1/3 of the growth for the year was from agencies appointed since the beginning of 2023, reflecting our strategy of appointing additional agencies where we identify appropriate expansion opportunities. Policy retention rates in 2024 were similar to last year, with our Commercial Lines segment up slightly but still in the upper 80% range.\nOur Personal Lines segment remained in a similar position of the low to mid-90% range. The overall result was consolidated property casualty net written premium growth are growing 17% for the quarter, including 15% growth in agency renewal premiums and 23% in new business premiums. Next is a brief review of performance by Insurance segment for full year 2024 compared with 2023. Most metrics also improved on a fourth quarter basis. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 8% with an excellent combined ratio that improved by 3 percentage points to 93.2%.\nPersonal Lines grew net written premiums 30% and improved the combined ratio by 2.9 percentage points to 97.5%. Excess and Surplus lines grew net written premiums 15% with a 94.0% combined ratio. Although that was 3.4 percentage points higher than last year, it's still quite profitable. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable. Cincinnati Re grew net written premium 7% with an 85.0% combined ratio while Cincinnati Global's growth was 8% with a 73.6% combined ratio.\nOur life insurance subsidiary also improved its results with a 21% increase in 2024 net income and term life insurance earned premium growth of 3%. These strong results combined to bring our value creation ratio and above our target of 10% to 13% on a 5-year average basis. Our fourth quarter DCR was 1.8%, and we reached 19.8% on a full year basis. Net income before investment gains or losses for the year contributed 9.9%, higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed to the other half.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mike, I'll provide our current estimates of financial effects related to the recent California wildfires and an update on our 2025 reinsurance program. We estimate first quarter 2025 pretax catastrophe losses of approximately $450 million to $525 million net of reinsurance recoveries. That includes approximately 73% for our Personal Lines Insurance segment, 24% for Cincinnati Re and 3% for Cincinnati Global. We reinstated the applicable layers of our primary property catastrophe reinsurance treaty coverage and will seed additional premiums to our reinsurers.\nCincinnati Re will receive additional premiums from treaties reinstated. The estimated net effect of first quarter premium revenue is a decrease of $50 million to $60 million. To keep this event in perspective, had the wildfire effect occurred in 2024, we believe we would still have earned a modest underwriting profit. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers.\nFor our per risk treaties, we increased our retention for the property treaty to $15 million, while retention for the casualty treaty remained at $10 million. Other terms and conditions for 2025 are fairly similar to 2024. The primary objective for our property catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's may change this year is adding another $300 million of coverage, increasing the top of the program from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. We again retained all of the first $200 million, then retain 56% of the next $100 million, 25% of the next $100 million and approximately 14% of the next $1.1 billion.\nNow let me turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, for additional highlights of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income reached $1 billion for the year and significantly contributed to our improved operating performance. It grew 17% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year 2024 compared with the same periods of last year.\nDividend income was down 4% in the fourth quarter, driven by third quarter sales of equity securities from previously disclosed rebalancing of our investment portfolio. Bond interest income grew 28% for the fourth quarter this year. Net purchases of fixed maturities securities totaled $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.5 billion for the year. The fourth quarter pretax average yield of 4.93% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 45 basis points compared with last year.\nThe average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2024 was 5.66%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the fourth quarter were unfavorable for both our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net loss was $136 million for the equity portfolio and $350 million for the bond portfolio.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.2 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $553 million. Cash flow in addition to higher bond yields continue to benefit investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2024 was $2.6 billion, up 29% from last year.\nRegarding expense management, our objective is to balance spending control efforts with investing strategically in our business. Our 29.9% full year 2024 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was in line with 2023 in total and for each major expense category.\nThe fourth quarter ratio was 1.4 percentage points lower than last year primarily due to lower accruals for agency profit sharing commissions in addition to premium growth outpacing the increase in employee-related expenses. My next topic is loss reserves, where our approach remains consistent and aims for the net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.\nDuring 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.1 billion, including $998 million for the IBNR portion. We experienced $236 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.7 percentage points during 2024. For our commercial casualty line of business, there was no material reserve development for any prior accident year during the fourth quarter.\nOn an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development during 2024 included a favorable $369 million for '23, favorable $63 million for '22, favorable $5 million for '21 and an unfavorable $201 million in aggregate for accident years prior to '21. My final comments highlight our capital management activities. For full year 2024, we returned capital to shareholders through $490 million of dividends paid in addition to share repurchases.\nShares repurchased totaled 1.1 million shares at an average price of approximately $113 per share, including an immaterial amount during the fourth quarter. We believe our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent position. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end totaled $5.2 billion. Debt to total capital remained under 10%. And our quarter end book value was at a record high $89.11 per share with nearly $14 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth [indiscernible] our insurance operations.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. 2025 marks the 75th anniversary of the Cincinnati Insurance Company. Over that time, we've come to understand the importance of stability, consistency and financial strength. We understand that we are in the business of accepting risk. We plan for it, we price for it. We spend considerable time and effort focused on appropriately balancing growth and profitability through geographic and product diversification, pricing risk management.\nNo one expects to experience a catastrophic loss such as those thought by the people [indiscernible], confident in our financial strength. Our claims associates can focus on delivering fast, fair, an empathetic service. At the same time, we are ready to build value for shareholders. The Board recently reinforced their confidence in our strategy by declaring a 7% dividend increase payable in April and paving the way to extend our streak of increasing dividends to 65 years.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Gary, please open the call for questions."

To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Spray; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.\nAt that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Chairman, Steve Johnson; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Shambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nPlease note that some of these matters to be discussed today are forward-looking.

In addition to our strong financial performance, recent travel to meet with agents reinforced my excitement about the future. Agents are quite enthusiastic about doing business with us, citing our responsiveness as we answer the call, both literally and figure to help them navigate this challenging insurance market.\nWhile picking up the phone is part of our culture, the confidence we have in our expertise in Cincinnati's financial strength lets us continue growing profitably, delivering insurance solutions for our agents and their best clients.\nNet income of $312 million for the second quarter of 2024 included recognition of $112 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held.

Investment income continued to grow nicely and contributed $17 million of the increase.\nThe 98.5% second quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than the second quarter of last year and included a decrease of 0.8 points for catastrophe losses. That brought the first half combined ratio to 96.1%, a nice place to be as we head into the second half of the year.\nTypically, the end of the year tends to be better than the beginning, in part due to the catastrophe loss ratio averaging about 2 points better in the second half based on the past 10 years. Our 88.2% accident year 2024 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 2.2 percentage points compared with accident year 2023 for the second quarter and was 0.7 points better on a 6-month basis.\nOnce again, overall reserve development on prior accident years was favorable, although it was 3.6 points lower than a year ago, as we continue to consider uncertainty regarding ultimate losses and remain prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.\nWe are entering the second half of the year with confidence and optimism. In addition to improved accident year results and an overall combined ratio for the first half of 2024 that was better than last year's first half, we are pleased with measures -- with other measures regarding our operating performance.\nWe have strong second quarter premium growth and believe it is profitable growth. We continue to use pricing segmentation by risk, plus average price increases, along with careful risk selection to help improve our underwriting profitability. Those efforts, plus others, are bolstering our progress in managing elevated inflation effects on insured losses.\nAgencies representing Cincinnati Insurance produced another quarter of profitable business for us, and we continue to appoint additional agencies where we see appropriate expansion opportunities. Our underwriters continue to do excellent work, as they emphasize retaining profitable accounts and managing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing based on our risk selection and pricing expertise.\nEstimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were, again, at healthy levels, with commercial lines near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, excess and surplus lines in the high single-digit range, personal auto in the low double-digit range and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 14% for the quarter, including 12% growth in agency renewal premiums and 34% in new business premiums.\nNext, I'll briefly highlight operating performance by Insurance segment, focusing on second quarter premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premium 7% for the second quarter, with a 99.1% combined ratio that increased by 2.2 percentage points and included prior accident year reserve development that was less favorable by 2.9 points.\nPersonal Lines grew net written premiums 30%, including growth in middle market accounts, in addition to Cincinnati Private Client, business for our agency's high net worth clients. Its combined ratio was 106.9%, 0.7 percentage points better than last year despite an increase of 1.2 points from higher catastrophe losses. Excess and Surplus lines grew net written premiums 15% and was also profitable with a combined ratio of 95.4%, up 3.2 percentage points from second quarter a year ago due to unfavorable reserve development.\nBoth Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were, again, very profitable and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the second quarter of 2024 was an excellent 70.1%. It grew net written premiums by 17%, bringing the overall 6-month written premium for 2024 in line with 2023.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 63.2%. While it grew net written premiums 2% for the first half of the year, second quarter premiums were down 18%, reflecting pricing discipline in a very competitive market. Our life insurance subsidiary had an outstanding quarter, including net income of $24 million and operating income growth of 26%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew 2%.\nI'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance and value creation ratio. Our second quarter 2024 VCR was 2.2%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 1.6%. Higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 0.6%.\nNow Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add his comments to highlight other parts of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.\nInvestment income continued to grow, up 10% for the second quarter of 2024 compared with the same quarter in 2023. Dividend income was down 1% or $1 million for the quarter, primarily due to 2 unusual items that totaled approximately $2 million. One was a holding with a June ex dividend date in 2023 that moved to July 1, 2024. The other was a holding that reduced its dividend rate by 53% after a spin-off transaction.\nBond interest income grew 18% for the second quarter of this year. We, again, added fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio, with net purchases totaling $771 million for the first 6 months of the year. The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.64% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 30 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2024 was 6.06%.\nValuation changes in aggregate for the second quarter of 2024 were favorable for our equity portfolio and unfavorable for our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $149 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net loss of $93 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion.\nThe equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.4 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $700 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income in addition to higher bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 33% from a year ago.\nI'll move on to expense management, where we always work to balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The second quarter 2024 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.5 percentage points higher than last year, reflecting higher levels of profit sharing commissions for our agencies and employee-related expenses.\nNext, let me comment on loss reserves, where our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first 6 months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss expense reserves was $578 million, including $506 million for the IBNR portion.\nDuring the second quarter, we experienced $40 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 1.9 percentage points. The Commercial Lines segment saw overall favorable reserve development of $29 million, driven by workers' compensation and commercial property, which more than offset the unfavorable development in commercial casualty. Commercial casualty was again the line of business having the largest amount of unfavorable reserve development, with a total of $28 million for the quarter or less than 1% of that line's year-end 2023 reserve balance.\nWe released reserves in some recent accident years and added reserves, totaling $51 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2021, including $30 million for 2018 through 2020 due to case incurred losses emerging at amounts higher than we expected. The unfavorable amount reflects our slowing release of IBNR reserves for some of those older accident years, while adding to others.\nOn an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2024 included: favorable $269 million for 2023, favorable $36 million for 2022, favorable $17 million for 2021 and an unfavorable $182 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2021, with commercial casualty representing $167 million of the unfavorable $182 million.\nI'll conclude my comments with the capital management highlights, another area where we have a consistent long-term approach. We paid $125 million in dividends to shareholders during the second quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 395,000 shares at an average price per share of $116.33.\nWe think our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital contributed -- continued to be under 10% and at our quarter end, book value was at a record high, $81.79 per share, with $12.8 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity, providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nStephen Michael Spray\n\nSenior VP, Chief Insurance Officer & Director, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Before we move on to questions, I'd like to share some additional observations based on my first few months as CEO.\nI've spoken with many of our agents and associates, and they share my high level of confidence in the future of this company. In the first 6 months of this year, we've achieved a combined ratio of 96.1%. That makes 12.5 consecutive years of underwriting profit. A core loss ratio that continues to improve, growth in net written premiums of 14%, with investment income up 13%.\nWe've set the stage for 64 years of increasing dividends to shareholders. In the most challenging market in my career, our balance sheet allows us to lean in and grow with our agents, and I'm really excited about where we're headed.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Solaria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Jason, please open the call for questions."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the Navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steven Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steven Soloria and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nFirst, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. In short, we are off to a great start. Our first quarter results reflect the success of our initiatives to continue balancing the profit and growth of our insurance operations, coupled with strong investment income. Net income of $755 million for the first quarter of 2024 included recognition of $484 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held, representing about 3/4 of the increase in net income.\nStrong operating results generated the rest of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income of $272 million for the first quarter nearly doubled last year's $141 million including a decrease in catastrophe losses of $93 million on an after-tax basis. The 93.6% first quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 7.1 points better than the first quarter of last year, including a decrease of 6.9 points for catastrophe losses. While our combined ratio for accident year 2024 before catastrophe losses was a percentage point higher than accident year 2023 at 3 months.\nIf we exclude Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, the ratio improved by 1 point. Accident year 2024 also improved on a case incurred basis. However, we increased, incurred but not reported, or IBNR reserves as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses and remain prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.\nWe are also pleased with other measures indicating good momentum in our operating performance. Another quarter of pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases helped to improve our underwriting profitability, combining with careful risk selection and other efforts to address elevated inflation effects on incurred losses. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance supported by our experienced to professional associates produced another quarter of profitable business for us.\nOur underwriters continue to emphasize retaining profitable accounts and managing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing based on our risk selection and pricing expertise. Estimated average renewal price increases for the first quarter continued at a healthy pace with commercial lines near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, access to surplus lines in the high single-digit range. Personal auto in the low double-digit range in homeowner in the high single-digit range.\nOur consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 11% for the quarter with what we believe was a nice mix of new business and renewals. I'll briefly review operating performance by Insurance segment, highlighting premium growth and improved profitability compared to a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 7% in the first quarter with a 96.5% combined ratio that improved by 3.9 percentage points, including 4.2 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 33%, including growth in middle market accounts in addition to private client business for our agencies, high net worth clients. [indiscernible] combined ratio was a very profitable 93.9%, 18.6 percentage points better than last year, including 15.9 points from lower catastrophe losses.\nExcess and Surplus lines also produced a profitable combined ratio of 91.9%, rising 2 percentage points from the first quarter a year ago, along with net written premium growth of 7%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continue to produce significant underwriting profit, reflecting our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was an excellent 78.6%. That includes IBNR that we routinely carried for expected losses from reinsurance treaties. We believe our potential exposure for losses from the Baltimore bridge collapse is immaterial. Cincinnati Re net written premiums decreased by 12% overall driven by a shifting casualty portfolio mix in response to changing market conditions.\nProperty and Specialty premiums increased due to attractive opportunities and pricing. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 69.8%, they again reported strong growth with net written premiums up 28%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its strong performance, including first quarter 2024 net income of $19 million and operating income growth of 17%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, our first quarter 2024 VCR was a strong 5.9%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 2.3%, higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 3.6%.\nNext, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments to highlight other parts of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at a strong pace, up 17% for the first quarter of 2024 compared with the first quarter of 2023. Dividend income was up 9% for the quarter, despite net equity security sales for the first 3 months of 2024, that totaled $40 million. Bond interest income grew 21% for the first quarter of this year, we continue to add more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $374 million for the first 3 months of the year. The first quarter pretax average yield of 4.65% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 40 basis points compared with last year.\nThe average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2024 was 5.79%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the first quarter of 2024 were favorable for our equity portfolio and unfavorable for our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $602 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net loss of $65 million for the bond portfolio.\nAt the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.6 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.2 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $625 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income in addition to higher bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2024 was $353 million, up 41% from a year ago. Our expense management objectives include an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2024 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.7 percentage points higher than last year, primarily related to higher levels of profit sharing commissions for agencies. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nAs we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first 3 months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss, loss expense reserves was $233 million, including $272 million for the IBNR portion.\nDuring the first quarter, we experienced $100 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.0 percentage points. Almost every line of business had favorable development, except for commercial casualty, which was unfavorable by just $254,000. We added reserves to several older prior accident years and reduced reserves for the 3 most recent accident years.\nOn an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of 2024 included favorable $184 million for 2023, favorable $24 million for 2022 and an unfavorable $108 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2022.\nThe unfavorable amount reflects our slowing the release of IBNR reserves for those older accident years. I'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights another area where we have a consistent long-term approach. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the first quarter of 2024.\nWe also repurchased 680,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.89. We think our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Payer company cash and marketable securities at quarter end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continued to be under 10%. And our quarter end book value was a record high $80.83 per share with $12.7 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity, providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. As we've previously announced, this is my last conference call as CEO effective at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders next Saturday President, Steve Spray, will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. As I've mentioned before, Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency center strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his abilities to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for shareholders, agents and associates. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Raghav, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call.\nLate yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio.

Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results.\nWe had strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, and I'm happy to see that our hard work is reflected in the progress we are making. Net income rose $170 million to nearly $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $18 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities still held in our equity portfolio.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 78% or $157 million versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 42% higher than 2022. Our 87.5%, fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 7.4 percentage points better than in 2022. With the catastrophe loss ratio representing 6.5 points of the improvement. That strong underwriting performance followed our recent pattern of improvement, resulting in a 94.9% full year 2023 combined ratio. That was 3.2 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 0.5 points in the catastrophe loss ratio.\nOur 2023 [ ex-cat ] accident year combined ratios were also favorable compared with 2022, improving 2.1 percentage points to 85.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.8 points to 88.4% for the year. We saw positive momentum in many areas of operating performance. Growth for consolidated property casualty net written premiums accelerated, reaching 13% for the fourth quarter, including 10% for renewal premiums and 30% for new business premiums.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and to counter the continuing effects and inflation on insured losses, we combine pricing segmentation by risk with average price increases and careful risk selection. Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment, again, averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.\nPersonal lines for the fourth quarter included auto, continuing in the low double-digit range and homeowner continuing near the low end of the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates in 2023 were similar to 2022, with our Commercial Lines segment down slightly but still in the upper 80% range. In our Personal Lines segment, up slightly but still in the low to mid-90% range.\nBriefly reviewing operating performance by Insurance segment, I'll focus on the full year results. Although I'll note that each segment improved their combined ratios in the fourth quarter compared to last year as they continue to grow profitably. Our Commercial segment improved its full year 2023 combined ratio by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022 and grew net written premiums by 4%. Our Personal Lines segment grew net written premiums by 26%, with growth for middle market business in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business its combined ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year due to the catastrophe loss ratio rising 3.7 points. Our Excess and Surplus line segment was very profitable. producing a 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% with net room premium growth of 14%.\nBoth Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable. Cincinnati Re's full year combined ratio was an excellent 77.7%. Its net written premiums were 5% lower than in 2022, reflecting our opportunistic positioning of the portfolio through evolving market conditions. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 75.5%, with 22% growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary grew profit and premiums to as full year 2023 net income rose 15% and earned premiums grew 4%.\nOn January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property [indiscernible] treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2024 are fairly similar to 2023, other than an average premium rate increase of approximately 12%. The primary objective of our Property Catastrophe Treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is adding another $100 million of coverage, increasing the top of the program from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Should we experience a 2024 catastrophe event totaling $1.2 billion in losses, we will retain $423 million compared with $617 million in 2023 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2024 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $180 million, more than the actual $136 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2023 due to additional coverage, rate increase and subject premium growth.\nFolks who follow our company, know we prefer to track our success over a long time horizon. Consistent with that approach, we set a target for the value creation ratio, our primary performance measure, at an annual average of 10% to 13% over the next 5 years. We believe the VCR is an appropriate measure since it's driven by strong combined ratio results, premium growth that exceeds the industry average and contributions from our investment portfolio.\nSince 2016, our combined ratio of 5-year average has ranged from 94.3% to 96.1%, near the low end of the longer-term target of 95% to 100% we've disclosed for many years. And for more than a decade, we've recorded results ahead of the industry for premium growth on a 5-year compound annual growth rate basis.\nBecause we believe we can continue to perform at a high level we are setting our sights on a longer-term combined ratio better than the past target, now targeting a 5-year average of 92% to 98%. While we will no longer publicly disclose annual targets for combined ratio and premium growth, we expect to continue our robust disclosure detail to help investors model and form their own expectations of future results. This doesn't mean that we'll ignore the shorter-term results. We recognize that it also means that to achieve our revised long-term target range, some years we need to reach combined ratios towards the lower end, knowing there could be some years like 2022 that come in near the higher end.\nI'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with the value creation ratio. Our 15.2%, 5-year annual average VCR as of year-end 2023 exceeded our target range of 10% to 13%. VCR of 19.5% for full year 2023 included a contribution of 9.1% from net income before investment gains or losses while higher valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 10.4%.\nNow Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results and other important aspects of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income was a significant part of higher net income and improved operating results, up 15% for the fourth quarter and 14% for a full year 2023 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income was up 7% for the quarter, largely due to a special dividend from one of our stock holdings. On a full year 2023 basis, we added to the equity portfolio with net purchases totaling $14 million. Bond interest income, again, grew at a good pace, up 19% for the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to add fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $1.4 billion for full year 2023.\nThe fourth quarter pretax average yield of 4.48% and for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 32 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2023 was 6.13%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. Before tax effects, the net gain was [ $1.50 ] billion for the equity portfolio and $621 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of 2023, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.1 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $570 million.\nCash flow continued to benefit investment income as did rising bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2023 was just over $2 billion matching last year.\nRegarding expense management, we always intend to strive to an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. Our full year 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio at 30.0% was in line with 2022. While the fourth quarter ratio was 1.3% -- percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to higher profit sharing commissions for agencies and associate related expenses.\nNext, I'll summarize loss reserve activity. Our approach remains consistent and aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Our quarterly study of updated paid and case reserve loss and loss expense data for our commercial casualty line of business considered how fourth quarter incurred amounts were higher than we expected, especially for the general liability coverages for older accident years.\nTo reflect the continued uncertainty of ultimate losses and loss expenses, we increased our estimates for several prior accident years to levels more likely to be adequate. The net amount of the fourth quarter increase was $51 million, including $29 million for accident years prior to 2019. Commercial casualty unfavorable reserve development on a full year 2023 basis was fairly small at $15 million. Only 0.5% of the year-end 2022 reserve balance. Prior accident year reserve development for commercial umbrella during 2023 and was a favorable $6 million.\nDuring 2023, our net addition to total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $682 million, including $634 million for the IBNR portion. For full year 2023, we experienced $215 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.8 percentage points, marking 35 consecutive years of net favorable development on prior accident year loss and loss expense reserves.\nOn an online basis by accident year, net reserve development for full year 2023 included a favorable $137 million for 2022, favorable $21 million for 2021, favorable $68 million for 2020 and an unfavorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.\nI'll conclude with a few capital management highlights. Another area where our approach includes careful consideration of the long term. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not repurchase any shares. Our view of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both remain in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continue to be under 10%. And our year-end 2023 book value of $77.06 per share means the $12.1 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity provides plenty of opportunity for profitable growth by supporting $8.1 billion of annual property casualty net written premiums.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on our recent leadership and Board announcements. Effective at our annual shareholder meeting in May, President, Steve Spray, will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his ability to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for associates, agents and shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board.\nWe also announced the addition of Steve and Peter Wu as Cincinnati Financial Directors. Peter has exceptional experience in the world of predictive analytics, data modeling and artificial intelligence. I'm honored that he has agreed to join our Board.\nFinally, the Board set the stage for a 64th consecutive year of raising shareholder dividends by increasing the dividend 8% to $0.81 per share. From the Board to the leadership team, to associates at every level of our company, we have the perfect people in place to create a bright future for Cincinnati Financial. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer.\nRocco, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hopper.\nFirst, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We are pleased with our operating performance in the third quarter as we again saw improved underwriting ratios for almost every major line of business compared with the first half of this year.\nThe net loss of $99 million for the third quarter of 2023 included recognition of $362 million on an after-tax basis for the reduction of fair value of equity securities still held. We continue to believe the value of our equity portfolio will increase over the long term. As of September 30, it had $5.6 billion in appreciated value. It decreased 8% during the third quarter but has increased 2% since the end of last year.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $261 million for the third quarter more than doubled last year's $116 million, including a decrease of catastrophe losses of $58 million on an after-tax basis. The 94.4% third quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 9.5 percentage points better than the third quarter of last year, including a decrease of 4.8 points for catastrophe losses.\nOur 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios are also better than '22, improving 3.4 percentage points for the third quarter and 1.7 points on a 9-month basis.\nSimilar to last quarter, we also see signs of positive momentum in operating performance. Pricing segmentation by risk and significant average price increases contributed to the increase in our [ underwriting ] profit combined with risk selection and other efforts to address elevated inflation effects on incurred losses.\nOn a current accident year basis, measured at September 30, before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.3 percentage points on a case incurred basis. For the same time period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 3.0 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.\nAgencies appointed by Cincinnati Insurance are producing profitable business for us, working with associates who provide outstanding service to agents and their clients. Our underwriters are working diligently to retain profitable accounts while managing loans that we determine have inadequate pricing. They are also careful in selecting risks and pricing new business policies.\nEstimated average renewal price increases for the third quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines segment again averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the third quarter included auto rising to the low double-digit range and homeowner rising to the low end of the high single-digit range.\nWe reported 12% growth in consolidated property casualty net written premiums for the quarter. That included an 11% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums, reflecting higher levels of insured exposures in addition to price increases.\nConsidering operating performance by insurance segment, I'll comment on premium growth and how profitability is improving compared to a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 5% in the third quarter, reflecting pricing discipline. For example, lower written premiums this year for workers' compensation and commercial umbrella together reduced the third quarter 2023 growth rate for total Commercial Lines by 2 percentage points. The Commercial Lines combined ratio improved by 3.8 percentage points despite an increase of 2.2 points from higher catastrophe losses.\nPersonal Lines grew net written premiums 29% with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for our agency's high net worth clients. The combined ratio was 4.6 percentage points better than last year, including 2.0 points for lower catastrophe losses.\nExcess and Surplus Lines improved its combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points and continue to grow profitably with net written premiums up 6%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, again enhanced our overall combined ratio and continue to demonstrate risk diversification benefits. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the third quarter of 2023 was an excellent 81.0% with net written premiums essentially matching last year's third quarter.\nCasualty premiums again decreased as we saw fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market. Property premiums increased 24%, largely due to higher pricing while specialty premiums increased 31% due to attractive opportunities in pricing.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was an excellent 79.5% while reporting strong growth with net written premiums up 21%. Our life insurance subsidiary again performed well, with third quarter 2023 net income up 9% and term life insurance earned premiums growing 2%.\nI'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. While our VCR on a 9-month basis is 4.4%, our third quarter 2023 VCR was negative 2.6%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed positive 2.4% and lower valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed negative 5.0%.\nNext, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add his commentary about our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income again contributed nicely to improve operating results, growing 17% for the third quarter 2023 compared with the third quarter of 2022. Dividend income was up 5% for the quarter, in part due to net equity security purchases for the first 9 months of 2023, that totaled $89 million.\nBond interest income continued to show strong growth, up 19% for the third quarter of this year. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling just over $1 billion for the first 9 months of the year.\nThe third quarter pretax average yield of 4.44% for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 36 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of 2023 was 6.4%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the third quarter of 2023 were unfavorable for both our equity and bond portfolios.\nBefore tax effects, the net loss was $463 million for the equity portfolio and $369 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.4 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.6 billion while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $1.2 billion.\nCash flow continued to boost investment income, adding to the benefit of rising bond yields, cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2023 was nearly $1.5 billion, up $54 million from a year ago. We always strive for our expense management efforts to strike an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business.\nThe third quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to an increase in associate and travel-related expenses. On a 9-month basis, it was 0.4 points lower.\nMoving on to loss reserves. Our approach consistently aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and an updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year in line of business.\nFor the first 3 quarters of 2023, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $655 million, including $539 million for the IBNR portion. During the third quarter, we experienced $53 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.7 percentage points.\nOn an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of 2023 included favorable $123 million for 2022, $7 million for 2021, $72 million for 2020 and $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.\nIn terms of capital management, we also have a consistent long-term approach. During the third quarter of 2023, we paid $115 million in dividends to shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares. Our assessment of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both are in excellent condition.\nAs usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.56. Life insurance operations increased book value, $0.73. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $1.04. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $1.86. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $2.33. [indiscernible], we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $2.61 per share during the third quarter to $67.72 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. I'm proud of the way our associates continue to help the independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance navigate this challenging market. We're sticking to our fundamentals, listening, offering solutions and building strong relationships. Because our field associates live in the communities our agents serve, we see and respond quickly to market pressures most impacting them. We are then able to find solutions that contribute to our agent success, leading to long-term shareholder value.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hopper. Gary, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial.

Net income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2023 was quite a change from the net loss of more than $800 million for last year's second quarter.\nAs we've noted in the past, large income swings can occur as gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value. And this year, we recognized a significant investment gain. We believe the value of our equity portfolio will continue to grow over the long term.\nAs of June 30, it had $6.1 billion in appreciated value, increasing 8% since the end of the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income of $191 million for the quarter more than doubled the $94 million from a year ago despite catastrophe losses that were $11 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 97.6% second quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 5.6 percentage points better than last year's second quarter, including a decrease of 0.4 points for catastrophe losses. The 90.4% ex-cat accident year combined ratio for the second quarter was 2.4 percentage points better than the same period a year ago and is another important indicator of improved performance.\nDespite the increase in catastrophe losses and ongoing elevated inflation effects, we continue to see reasons for confidence about performance for the second half of the year. Pricing continued to accelerate during the second quarter of this year, and we also worked to address inflation in other ways, such as changing factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs.\nWe reported improved underwriting performance ratios in just about every major line of business compared with the first quarter of this year. On a current accident year basis, measured at June 30 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 and consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.5 percentage points on a case incurred basis, which included 0.6 point improvement on a paid basis.\nFor the same period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 4.7 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.\nSimilar to the first quarter, we earned a small underwriting profit for our commercial umbrella line in the second quarter. In our commercial casualty line of business in total had an estimated combined ratio of approximately 90%. Our underwriters continue to do an excellent job in risk selection and pricing Importantly, Asians appointed by Cincinnati Insurance continue to produce profitable business for us in an outstanding fashion.\nUnderwriters emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were higher than the first quarter for each of our major lines of business. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range.\nPersonal Lines for the second quarter included auto in the high single-digit range and homeowner in the mid-single-digit range. In terms of net written premiums, consolidated property casualty growth was 9% for the second quarter of 2023. That included an 11% increase in second quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insurance exposures as we factor in elevated inflation.\nNext, I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. Commercial Lines grew second quarter 2023 net written premiums 3%, reflecting discipline, particularly for commercial umbrella risks. Its combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points better than a year ago, including 1.5 points from lower catastrophe losses. We see the second quarter 10% reduction in new business written premiums as an expected result of pricing and underwriting discipline.\nPersonal Lines grew net written premiums 23%, with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for the high net worth clients and our agencies. Its combined ratio was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago despite an increase of 0.6 points from catastrophe losses.\nExcess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 92.2% and net written premiums grew 16%. Its combined ratio was 7.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 9.9 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continued to enhance our profitability. Cincinnati Re had a strong 73.7% combined ratio for the second quarter of 2023. Its net written premiums essentially matched last year's second quarter, while casualty premiums decreased as a result of fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market, property net written premiums increased by 27% and largely due to a combination of higher pricing and market opportunities.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was 88.3% with net written premiums continuing strong growth at 19%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to report excellent results in the second quarter with net income up 91% from last year in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%.\nAs I usually do, I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our second quarter 2023 VCR was 4.0%, another strong result. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.8%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 2.2%.\nNow our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other important factors about our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued at a strong pace of 13% for the second quarter of 2023 versus last year's second quarter. As expected, dividend income decreased 3% for the quarter due to 2 items we touched on last quarter.\nFirst, we are seeing dividend rates increase more slowly. Second, in last year's second quarter, we received a $5 million special dividend from 1 of our stockholdings that didn't repeat this year. Net equity security purchases for the first half of 2023 totaled $93 million. Bond interest income rose 19% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022.\nWe added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with the net purchases totaling $732 million for the first 6 months of the year. The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.34% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 34 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2023 was 5.88%. Valuation changes in aggregate for our equity portfolio during the second quarter of 2023 were favorable, but were unfavorable for the bond portfolio.\nBefore tax effects, the net gain for the equity portfolio was $459 million, while the net loss for the bond portfolio was $158 million. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.1 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $838 million.\nStrong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth in addition to rising bond yields boosting interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2023 was $825 million, up 9% from a year ago. We continue to emphasize expense management with a balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business.\nThe second quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year as premium growth outpaced growth in total expenses. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.\nFor the first half of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $452 million, including $358 million for the IBNR portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $101 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.5 percentage points.\nOn an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2023 included: favorable $99 million for 2022; unfavorable $5 million for 2021; favorable $49 million for 2020 and a favorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.\nRegarding capital management, our approach remains consistent as we pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe our financial flexibility is outstanding, and that our financial strength is in excellent shape. During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 398,000 shares at an average price per share of $104.48. We also paid $117 million in dividends to shareholders during the quarter.\nAs usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.15. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.86.\nNet investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.31, and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2 per share during the second quarter to $7.33 per share.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. We are in the challenging insurance market, and I'm proud of the way our associates are navigating it. We believe we are taking the necessary actions to continue delivering profitable growth through all insurance cycles. In the last month, to third-party organizations agreed. S&P affirmed our high financial strength ratings, and we were also again included on the 50 list, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return.\nWe are 1 of only 4 companies named 32 times to the Property Casualty Awards 50 since the analysis began in 1991. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Solaria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Vaishnavi, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVice President, Investor Relations Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corp.\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you will first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nFirst, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.\nAlso, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and, therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Dennis, and good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $225 million for the first quarter of 2023 rebounded from a net loss position for the same quarter a year ago. As gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income, we'll continue to experience these swings. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value, and this year, we recognize a significant investment gain. We aren't concerned with these quarterly fluctuations in our equity portfolio. We believe the value will continue to grow over the long term. Currently, our equity portfolio holds $5.7 billion in appreciated value.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $141 million for the quarter was down $119 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $163 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 100.7% first quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 10.8 percentage points higher than last year's first quarter driven by an increase of 11.0 points for catastrophe losses.\nOur first quarter 90.1% ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 0.8 percentage points worse than the same period a year ago but 0.1 points better than the full 2022 ex-cat accident year combined ratio of 90.2% that we reported at our last conference call.\nDespite the increase in catastrophe losses and the persistency of elevated inflation effects, we see several reasons to be confident about performance for the remainder of the year. Pricing during the first quarter of this year was higher than the fourth quarter of last year for each major line of business. To help address inflation, we also make changes to factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs.\nOn a current accident year basis, measured at March 31 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 6.7 percentage points on a case-incurred basis, which includes a 1.6 point improvement on a paid basis. However, we increased the incurred but not reported, or IBNR, component of the ratio by 9.2 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.\nWe also earned a small underwriting profit on our commercial umbrella line for the quarter, another positive given recent quarter challenges we and the industry have experienced in various casualty lines of business. We're proud of our underwriters who are working with Cincinnati's appointed insurance agencies to overcome various challenges facing our industry. They continue to emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing the ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business.\nWhile the first quarter of last year was a record high for new business at that time and created a difficult comparison for growth this year, we believe our associates' pricing and underwriting discipline was also a factor in our 14% reduction in commercial line's new business written premiums in the first quarter of this year.\nTurning to net written premiums. The consolidated property casualty result rose 6% for the first quarter. That included a 10% increase in the first quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Our commercial lines insurance segment had estimated average renewal price increases near the high end of the mid-single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range. And personal lines average renewal price increases were in the mid-single-digit range, including both auto and homeowner. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates will continue to rise for our personal auto line of business, reaching a full year 2023 premium rate increase of approximately 10%.\nI'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by insurance segment. Commercial lines grew first quarter 2023 net rent premiums 4%. Its combined ratio was 8.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including 9.0 points from catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 20%, largely from planned expansion of Cincinnati Private Client business for high net worth clients of our agencies. Its combined ratio was 28.6% and percentage points higher than a year ago, including 23.0 points from catastrophe losses.\nExcess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 89.9% with net written premiums growing 10%. It's combined ratio was 4.0 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 16.0 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global had an impressive level of profitability for the first quarter of 2023. Cincinnati Re had a 79.6% combined ratio while net written premiums decreased by 9%. We benefited from the firm reinsurance market. Our pricing is stronger relative to the risk we assumed, and we tightened terms and conditions while also exercising underwriting discipline. We reallocated capacity to participations where seeding companies selected higher loss retention levels and nonrenewed certain quota share reinsurance treaties, where we had previously assumed risk on a retrocessional basis.\nCincinnati Global's combined ratio was 87.5% with net written premium growing 25%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income up 12% from last year's first quarter in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%.\nI'll conclude, as usual, with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our first quarter 2023 VCR was 3.1%. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.3%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 1.9%.\nNow our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other key factors of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Senior VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow, up 14% for the first quarter 2023 versus last year and outpacing the 12% we reported for the fourth quarter. Dividend income increased by 2% for the quarter as dividend rates are increasing more slowly. Looking ahead to next quarter's dividend growth, you may remember, we received a $5 million special dividend from one of our stockholdings in last year's second quarter that will make for a tough comparison in the second quarter of 2023.\nNet equity security purchases for the first quarter totaled $18 million. Bond interest income was up 14% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $303 million for the first 3 months of the year. The pretax average yield of 4.25% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 24 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2023 was 6.18%.\nValuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was $269 million before tax effects. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.7 billion while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $684 million.\nCash flow continued to augment rising bond yields, helping to grow interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2023 was $250 million, up 26% from a year ago.\nRegarding expense management, we intend to appropriately balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.7 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from a small ratio for accrued profit-sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses.\nMoving on to loss reserves. We maintain a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss, loss expense reserves was $271 million, including $266 million for the IBNR portion. We experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points.\nOn an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of 2023 included favorable $44 million for 2022, unfavorable $2 million for 2021, favorable $34 million for 2020 and unfavorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.\nWe remain steadfast in how we approach capital management, and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We believe our financial flexibility is quite good and that we have excellent financial strength.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased nearly 202,000 shares at an average price per share of $123.84. As in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.05. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.12. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items headed $0.46. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value by $0.81. And Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.53, and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 per share during the first quarter to $68.33 per share.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on some transitions within our Cincinnati Re team. Later in the first quarter, Managing Director and Head of Cincinnati Re, Jamie Hole, resigned to pursue other interests. We thank Jamie for his significant contributions to our reinsurance business and for his work in assembling a strong team of seasoned reinsurance professionals. We wish him well with his motor sports ambitions and with any other future endeavors.\nBill Sandercock, who has led our Casualty Reinsurance division since 2016 is now leading Cincinnati Re. Bill has more than 35 years of reinsurance experience, including leadership roles with Aspen Re America and [ Gen Re ]. we are all confident in the future of Cincinnati Re under Bill's leadership and look forward to continuing to grow this aspect of our business over time.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Mark Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Marliese, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVP & IR Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray, and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria, Chief Claims Officer, Mark Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nFirst, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC.\nAlso, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nSteven J. Johnston\n\nChairman & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We see positive momentum in several areas and are bullish about our future prospects despite 2022 financial results that were somewhat below our expectations. Challenges during the year included elevated inflation and higher losses from natural catastrophe events for us and the property-casualty industry in addition to the market volatility affecting the valuation of investment portfolios.\nOur experience in managing adversity, coupled with the company's financial strength, allows us to maintain a long-term view and supports our confidence as we execute our plans. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was just over $1 billion. That's 31% or $457 million less than last year's outstanding fourth quarter largely due to $307 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.\nNon-GAAP operating income of $202 million for the fourth quarter was down $118 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $66 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 94.9% fourth-quarter property-casualty combined ratio was 10.7 percentage points higher than the 84.2% for the fourth quarter of last year, which was amongst the best combined ratios we've ever recorded.\nWe think longer-term comparisons are also important. On a current accident-year basis, excluding catastrophe losses, our 90.2% combined ratio compares favorably with each of the 5 years prior to 2020 and was 1.5 percentage points better than the average for that period with each accident year measured as of the respective year-end.\nOn a calendar-year basis, our 2022 combined ratio experienced a larger negative impact from catastrophe losses than in 2021 as they increased 4.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.2 points for the year. Inflation also pressured our combined ratio throughout 2022 contributing to less favorable results for both the current accident year and for reserve development on prior accident years as we have increased reserves for estimated ultimate losses.\nWe've responded with actions to improve underwriting selection and pricing, including premium rate increases and increased expectations by underwriters as they factor inflationary trends into areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure.\nWe believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve results next year with a 2023 GAAP combined ratio in the low- to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2023 property-casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property-casualty results we ultimately report.\nIn recent quarters, we've noted that commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated, although still elevated in the fourth quarter, it was to a less degree than earlier in 2022. While recent profitability for our commercial umbrella business is not as strong as we previously estimated, after strengthening reserves during 2020, the average combined ratio for the years 2018 through 2022 were still good, below 85% on a calendar-year basis and below 90% on an accident-year basis with development through year-end 2022.\nOverall premium growth was very good and continues to incorporate pricing segmentation. Our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while also addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing. They do an excellent job serving Cincinnati Insurance-appointed agencies that are outstanding at producing business for us.\nConsolidated property-casualty net written premiums rose 10% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year of 2022. That includes a 13% increase in fourth-quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. In addition to exposures increases, our Commercial Lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, higher than the third quarter. Our Excess and Surplus Lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.\nPersonal lines average renewal price increases were at the high end of the low single-digit range with both auto and homeowner higher than in the third quarter. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates for our personal auto line of business will continue to rise. Based on our rate filings that have averaged low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full-year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10%.\nPolicy retention rates improved from year-end 2021 with our Commercial Lines segment moving higher in the upper 80% range and our Personal Lines segment, rising to the low- to mid-90% range.\nMoving on to highlight premium growth and profitability by insurance segment, the Commercial Lines segment grew both fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 net written premiums, 9%. Its combined ratio for both the quarter and full-year 2022 was approximately 99%. That's above where we aim for and reflects elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses that were higher than a year ago.\nFor our Personal Lines segment, net written premium grew 16% for the quarter and 15% for the full-year 2022 as we continued our planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full-year combined ratio was approximately 99% and reflected elevated inflation effects and is likewise above our near-term profit target. We have confidence that our proven long-term strategy and near-term actions we have taken will blend to improve results for both commercial and personal lines.\nOur excess and surplus lines segment finished the year with a 90.4% combined ratio, a good result, combined with 2022 net written premium growing 18%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each had another year of healthy growth.\nCincinnati Re grew full-year 2022 net written premiums by 27% with a combined ratio of 97.4%. Cincinnati Global had a 2022 combined ratio of 88.9% with net written premiums growing 23%.\nOur life insurance subsidiary continued its good performance with full-year 2022 net income of $66 million, up 50% from a year ago, and term life insurance earned premiums grew by 5%.\nOn January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property-casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. Our strong capital supports retaining additional risk and managing cost of rising reinsurance-ceded premiums. For our per-risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2023 are fairly similar to 2022, other than premium rate increases that averaged approximately 13%.\nThe primary objective of our property-casualty treaty -- catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is retaining a greater share of losses for layers of coverage than what was effect for 2022, while adding $92 million of coverage in a new layer between $900 million and $1.1 billion.\nIn 2023, we'll retain all of the first $200 million of losses and a share of the next $900 million for a catastrophe event compared with 2022 when we retained the first $100 million and a share of the next $800 million. Should we experience a 2023 catastrophe event totaling $1.1 billion in losses, we'll retain $542 million compared with $499 million in 2022 for an event of that magnitude.\nWe expect 2023 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $130 million, approximately $16 million or 14% higher than the actual $114 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2022.\nOur investment department continued to perform quite well, and Mike will provide some details. Investments is another area where we like to keep an eye on longer-term trends. For example, for the 5 years ended with 2022, our equity portfolio, compound annual total shareholder return was 11.1%, 170 basis points better than the S&P 500 Index.\nI'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Net income, before investment gains or losses, contributed favorably to VCR 2.1% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year of 2022. The contribution from valuation of our investment portfolio was mixed, 10.5% favorable for the quarter but unfavorable by 19.4% for the year due to challenges for both the stock and bond markets. A positive VCR of 12.8% for the quarter improved our 2022 full year VCR to negative 14.6%. Although that's below our expectations for a typical year, the 11.2% annual average over the past 5 years is within our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. Now, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments about several other important points for evaluating our financial performance.\n\nMichael J. Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow at an outstanding pace, up 12% for the fourth quarter and 9% for full-year 2022 compared with the same periods of last year.\nDividend income rose 7% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during 2022 totaled $36 million.\nBond interest income was up 11% in the fourth quarter. The pretax average yield of 4.16% for the fixed-maturity portfolio was 17 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds continued to rise to 5.01% during full year 2022.\nWe continue to emphasize investing in fixed-maturity securities with net purchases during the year totaling $788 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2022 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings.\nThe overall net gain for the quarter was nearly $1.3 billion before tax effects, including an additional $230 million of unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of 2022, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.5 billion, while the fixed-maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $847 million.\nCash flow, in addition to rising bond yields, contributed to the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for the full year of 2022 generated almost $2.1 billion, a record high amount, up 4% from a year ago. For the fourth quarter of this year, it rose 36%.\nTurning to expense management. Our objective is to appropriately balance expense control with continuing to make strategic investments in our business. The full-year 2022 property-casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year, reflecting lower accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions.\nRegarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nWe have now had $34 million of net favorable development on prior accident years. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.\nDuring 2022, our net increase in the property-casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.029 billion, a 15% increase from the net reserve balance at year-end 2021. The IBNR portion of that reserve addition was $765 million, a further indication of the quality of our balance sheet. For full year 2022, we experienced $159 million of Property and Casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points.\nOf that $159 million in net favorable development, $25 million of the net unfavorable amount from our commercial casualty lines of business, including an unfavorable $41 million for commercial umbrella and a net favorable $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the full-year 2022 included favorable $96 million for 2021, favorable $124 million for 2020, unfavorable $72 million for 2019 and a favorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019.\nOur approach to capital management also remains consistent, and we repurchase shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe we have plenty of flexibility and also believe that our financial strength is in great shape. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased just over 101,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.55.\nAs in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property-casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.47. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.10. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items, added $0.83. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.14. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $5.15. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $7 per share during the fourth quarter to $67.01 per share. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven J. Johnston\n\nChairman & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. We faced a number of challenges in 2022 and still recorded an underwriting profit for our insurance business. That result bolsters our belief that we'll see future benefits from our efforts to continually refine pricing precision and segmentation and our efforts to expand our geographic footprint and produce -- and product offerings. When you consider our financial strength, our experienced service-oriented associates and our premier agency force, I'm confident we'll be able to continue delivering shareholder value far into the future.\nOur Board of Directors shares that confidence and expressed it by increasing our quarterly cash dividend 9% last month, setting the stage for a 63rd year of rising dividend payments. So that's not just paying the dividend for 63 straight years. That sets the stage for increasing the dividend for a 63rd consecutive year. We believe that's a record that can only be matched by 7 other publicly-traded U.S. companies.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Cole, please open the call for questions."

These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nChairman & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. In addition to market volatility affecting the valuation of our investment portfolio, elevated inflation and natural catastrophe events affecting the industry also continued to pressure our property casualty insurance results. We remain well positioned to improve performance through ongoing focus on successfully executing profitable growth strategies for our insurance operations, similar to how we have managed past challenges.\nOur financial strength provides us the ability to maintain a long-term view, keeping a steady approach that can benefit all stakeholders. We reported a net loss of $418 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million for the third quarter of 2022 was down $95 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $19 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.9% third quarter property casualty combined ratio was 11.3 percentage points higher than the 92.6% for the third quarter of last year. Inflationary pressures led to higher estimated ultimate losses and rising loss ratios on a current accident year basis, while we experienced another quarter of favorable development on prior accident years, it was less favorable than a year ago.\nWe continue to respond with underwriting selection and pricing actions addition to prudent reserving for estimated ultimate losses. In addition to various premium rate increase filings with the states, underwriters have increased expectations to address current inflationary trends in areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure.\nCommercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated in recent quarters, and it's challenging to determine relevant drivers given unusual business activity and general uncertainty as the pandemic waned. For example, the third quarter of 2022 included 3 very large claims with estimated losses averaging $9 million each, while elevated losses during the second quarter were driven more by a higher frequency of smaller claims. We continue to carefully underwrite commercial umbrella risks and respond promptly to adequately reserve for emerging loss patterns, which we expect will eventually lead to a return of profitability for our commercial umbrella business.\nOverall premium growth was strong and included average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies continued their outstanding production and our underwriters are focused on working to retain and grow profitable accounts while addressing areas where they judge pricing is not adequate segmenting opportunities on a policy-by-policy basis.\nConsolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 14% for the third quarter of 2022. That included a 12% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums, including 11% each for our commercial lines and personal lines insurance segments. Higher renewal premiums included healthy increases for higher levels of insured exposures that are rising faster due to elevated inflation amounts. For example, our commercial property premium adjustments for rising costs of building materials, so far this year, are about double the level of last year.\nIn addition to exposure increases, our commercial lines Insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, somewhat higher than the second quarter. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range, also higher than the second quarter. Personal lines average renewal price increases remained in the low single-digit range with auto a little higher and homeowner a little lower than the second quarter.\nPersonal auto insurance for the industry, including our book of business, generally needs higher premium rates to achieve profitability. Based on our rate filings that average low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10%.\nThe commercial lines segment grew third quarter 2022 net written premium by 10% with a combined ratio of 99.0%, reflecting elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses 1.2 percentage points higher than a year ago. For our personal lines segment, net written premium grew 15%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter combined ratio of 104.5% also reflected elevated inflation effects while the catastrophe loss ratio was 4.1 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. Our excess and surplus lines segment had a 93.9% combined ratio and continued healthy growth with the third quarter 2022 net written premiums increase of 16%.\nCincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each experienced significant catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ian that drove their underwriting loss for the quarter. We expect catastrophe losses of that magnitude from time to time. Our estimate as of September 30 was within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ian's magnitude based on our models. Results of modeled effects estimating probable maximum losses are disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K. Cincinnati Re grew third quarter 2022 net written premiums by 51%, while Cincinnati Global grew 21%, each having what we believe are good prospects for future profitability.\nOur life insurance subsidiary continued to perform quite well. Along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums up 4%, it produced third quarter 2022 net income of $21 million and nearly tripled operating income of a year ago. We continue to use the value creation ratio as our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 8.4% for the third quarter of 2022. Net income before investment gains or losses made a positive contribution, but was again offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter.\nNext, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other points we consider important regarding our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at a rate of 8% for the third quarter of 2022 compared with the third quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 8% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during the first 9 months of 2022 totaled $47 million. Bond interest income grew 7% in the third quarter. The pretax average yield of 4.08% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 2 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds continue to rise, reaching 5.39% during the third quarter of 2022. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases totaling $534 million during the first 9 months of the year.\nValuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.2 billion before tax effects, including an additional and $514 million of unrealized losses in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $3.5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $4.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of just under $1.1 billion.\nCash flow continues to fuel growth of investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2022 generated $1.4 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago.\nRegarding expense management, we continue to apply what we see as the appropriate balance between expense control and strategic investments in our business. The third quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.3 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies.\nNext, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.\nIn the first 3 quarters of 2022, our net addition to reserves was $814 million, already exceeding the full year amounts for both 2021 and 2020. We think that's a strong indication of the quality of our balance sheet. During the third quarter 2022, we experienced $43 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.4 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of 2022 was favorable and included $94 million for 2021, $95 million for 2020 that was partially offset by unfavorable $46 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.\nWhile we've recently reported significant unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years for our commercial casualty lines of business, the net $25 million for the first 9 months of 2022 included $41 million for the commercial umbrella and net favorable amount of $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty.\nMoving on to briefly highlight our consistent approach to capital management, we again repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. Importantly, we continue to believe we have plenty of financial flexibility and also believe that our financial strength remained in excellent shape. During the third quarter we repurchased just under 2.1 million shares at an average price per share of $98.50.\nAs usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.12. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.14. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.42. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $2.58. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.46 and we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the third quarter to $60.1 per share.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nChairman & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Our fundamentals are strong, and we have an excellent book of business curated from our agency's best accounts. We've clearly communicated across the organization the steps we need to take to improve challenged areas of our business and our underwriters are focused and aligned to those goals. Our financial strength remains excellent and allows us to keep concentrating on our long-term strategies and objectives of remaining a steady insurance market and producing shareholder value far into the future. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer.\nAnthony, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVP & IR Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steven Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.\nFirst, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.\n\nSteven J. Johnston\n\nChairman & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second-quarter results. Increased catastrophe losses and increasing inflation affecting the industry, pressured our property casualty insurance results for this quarter. We are well positioned to improve results through continued focus on pricing and risk selection. As we have in the past, we'll follow our proven formula to successfully analyze and address challenged areas of our insurance operations.\nOur financial strength remains excellent, and we are confident we can achieve profitable growth over the long term and through all economic cycles. We reported a net loss of $800 million -- $808 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $104 million for the second quarter of 2022 was down from last year's impressive $292 million, largely due to catastrophe losses that were $119 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.2% second-quarter property casualty combined ratio was 17.7 percentage points higher than the 85.5% posted second quarter of last year. That increase reflected higher catastrophe losses and less favorable results on both the prior-accident-year and current year -- current-accident-year basis.\nWe regularly disclose large losses exceeding $1 million for individual property casualty claims, excluding losses from catastrophes. Commercial property and commercial umbrella tend to account for the bulk of those losses, each typically about 1/3 of total large losses. We noted on our last call that commercial property large losses rose sharply in the first quarter of this year. That increase reversed in the second quarter when they declined 86% from the second quarter of 2021. For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, sorry. However, in the second quarter, commercial umbrella losses rose significantly, prompting reserve additions that we detailed in our 10-Q. That business has a long history of profitability for us and has benefited from very strong pricing in recent years for both the industry and us.\nOverall, premiums continued a healthy growth pattern with steady average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. We benefited from outstanding production from the finest independent agents, while our underwriters remain steadfast in seeking to retain and grow profitable accounts and address areas where they judge pricing is not adequate, segmenting opportunities on a policy-by-policy basis. Consolidated property casualty net written premium rose [15%] for the second quarter of 2022. Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the first quarter.\nOur excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were slightly higher than in the first quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Personal auto is an area where we plan to more aggressively raise rates in future quarters as we work to improve its loss ratio. Underwriting processes designed to help premiums keep pace with rising property values, whether from outsized inflation or other changes in insured exposure amounts, are another reason for significant increases in 2022 renewal written premiums.\nOur commercial lines segment grew second-quarter renewal premiums by 10%, and our personal lines segment also grew second-quarter renewal premiums by 10%. The commercial lines segment grew second-quarter 2022 net written premiums by 10% with a combined ratio of 106.3, including higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its second quarter combined ratio of 112.1% also included higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. The second quarter provided another example of the benefits of improving diversification over time by product line and geography.\nProfitability was very good for our operations in excess and surplus lines insurance, reinsurance, global specialty insurance and life insurance. Our excess and surplus line segment had an 85.1% combined ratio and continued strong growth with second-quarter 2022 net written premiums growing 17%.\nCincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each continued a pattern of profitable growth. Cincinnati Re, grew net written premiums by 31% for the second quarter of 2022, with a combined ratio in the low 80% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premium by 47%, with a combined ratio below 70%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income of $21 million and a 91% increase in operating income, along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums of 8%.\nWe continue to emphasize the importance over time of the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 11.2% for the second quarter of 2022. Net income, before investment gains or losses, made a positive contribution, but was offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter.\nNext, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will discuss a few more important insights regarding our financial performance.\n\nMichael J. Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continues to grow and was up 11% for the second quarter of 2022 compared with the second quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 20% for the quarter, aided by a $5 million special dividend from one of our stock holdings.\nNet equity securities purchased during the first half of 2022 totaled $40 million.\nBond interest income grew 6% in the second quarter. The pretax average yield of 4% for the fixed maturity portfolio was down 2 basis points from a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2022 was 4.75%. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases totaling $240 million during the first 6 months of the year.\nValuation changes for our investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate, for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.8 billion, before tax effects, including a net decrease of $610 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.3 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $564 million.\nCash flow continues to fuel growth of investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2022 generated $755 million compared with $917 million a year ago.\nAs in the past, we emphasize careful management of expenses and balance that with strategic investments in our business. The second-quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit-sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses.\nMoving on to loss reserves, we aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves.\nAs we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. In the first half of 2022, our net addition to reserves was $414 million, a pace well ahead of 2021 or 2020, and a level we believe is an indication of the quality of our balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2022, we experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2022 was favorable and included $61 million for 2021 and $54 million for 2020. That was partially offset by an unfavorable $15 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.\nNext, I'll comment briefly on capital management. We've had a consistent approach that includes share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. At the same time, changing circumstances or opportunities can influence us to repurchase more or less than historical averages. We continue to believe that we have plenty of financial flexibility and that our financial strength at the end of the quarter was excellent. Shareholder dividends continue to be our primary way of returning capital to shareholders and cash dividends declared in the first half of 2022 are up 10%. In addition, during the second quarter, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares at an average price per share of $124.44.\nAs usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.26. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.13. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items, added $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.03. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $5.81, and we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $9.13 per share during the second quarter to $66.30 per share.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven J. Johnston\n\nChairman & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. While this wasn't the kind of quarter we want to have, one quarter doesn't sway us from our long-term strategies and objectives. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are optimistic about the future. In the last month, 3 different third-party organizations agreed. Moody's and S&P both affirmed our strong financial strength ratings. We were also again included on the Ward's 50 list. We are 1 of only 4 companies named 31 times to the property casualty Ward's 50, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return.\nBefore we open the call for questions, I'd like to pause to recognize Marty Hollenbeck. Many of you know Marty from his years of investor travel. He's announced his intent to retire at the end of September after 35 years of service to our organization. We thank him for his steady hand overseeing investments, especially during some of the very challenging times of market volatility. As I'm sure you can all imagine, we're sad to see Marty go.\nAt the same time, however, I have absolute confidence in Steve Soloria and his ability to smoothly step in to lead our investment operation with his nearly 30 years of experience. I know you all will feel the same as you get to know him during future investor visits. As a reminder, with Marty, Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer.\nMJ, please open the call for questions."

Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. It was another quarter of good operating performance. Our agency-focused strategy led to profitable growth and reflects well on the skill and dedication of our associates and excellent relationships with terrific independent agents. We reported a net loss of $273 million for the quarter, due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2022 was up $31 million or 14% versus a year ago. Our 89.9% first quarter property casualty combined ratio was 1.3 percentage points better than last year's first quarter. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects rose slightly compared with accident year 2021 measured at 3 months, reflecting an increase in large losses for our property lines of business.\nWe again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention with meaningful average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines improved from a year ago to the upper 80% range. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 12% for the first quarter of 2022. Our pricing segmentation efforts continue to support what we believe is profitable growth as our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing. We also believe renewal pricing during the first quarter was again ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment.\nOur commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, personal lines average renewal price increases slowed by a small amount compared to the fourth quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.\nOur commercial lines segment grew first quarter 2022 net written premiums by 8% and with a combined ratio of 92.3%. Our personal lines segment net written premium grew 11%, reflecting our continued planned expansion of high-net worth business produced by our agencies. The segment's first quarter combined ratio of 83.9%, improved 17.2 percentage points from a year ago, driven by lower catastrophe losses. Our excess and surplus lines segment had an 85.9% combined ratio and continued strong growth, with first quarter 2022 net written premiums rising by 25%.\nCincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had a nice quarter with healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 30% for the first quarter of 2022 with a combined ratio in the mid-90% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premiums by 24%, with a combined ratio also in the mid-90% range.\nOur life insurance subsidiary generated first quarter 2022 net income of $10 million, matching last year's first quarter, and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 6%.\nI'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 6.9% for the quarter, while net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.9 percentage points. Lower investment valuations during the quarter resulted in the investment gains or losses component contributing negative 8.6 points.\nNow our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other important aspects of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank, you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income again grew at a good pace, up 6% for the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period a year ago. First quarter dividend income was up 12% and net equity securities purchase totaled $34 million. Bond interest income grew 4% in the first quarter while the pretax average yield of 4.01% for the quarter was down 13 basis points from a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2022 was 3.64%. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases during the quarter totaling $109 million.\nValuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stockholdings and our bond holdings.\n(technical difficulty)\ndollars before tax effects, including a net decrease of $746 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.6 billion, including $46 million for our bond portfolio.\nCash flow again helped to grow investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2022 generated at $198 million compared to $354 million a year ago.\nBalancing strategic investments in our business with expense containment initiatives continues to be a priority. The first quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 2.2 percentage points higher than last year. Most of the increase was from higher accruals for profit-sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses.\nRegarding loss reserves, we aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we considered new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the first quarter of 2022, we experienced $41 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years have benefited the combined ratio by 2.5 percentage points.\nIn recent years, we've experienced significant growth in commercial umbrella coverage within our commercial casualty lines of business, including 16% in 2021 as industry pricing for umbrella has been strong. Umbrella losses tend to be frequently -- relatively infrequent with high severity and we recently experienced an elevated level of large losses, particularly for accident year 2019. Due to increased uncertainty for our umbrella business, we strengthened reserves for certain accident years and estimated ultimate losses for accident year 2022 at what we believe is a prudent level.\nOn an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the quarter was favorable by $46 million for 2021, $24 million for 2022, unfavorable by 2020 by $28 million for 2019, and unfavorable by $1 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019.\nNow let me turn to capital management. We continue to follow a consistent approach that includes share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. However, changing circumstances or opportunities can influence us to repurchase more or less than historical averages. We believe that our quarter end financial strength was excellent and provides ample financial flexibility.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 375,000 shares at an average price per share of $120.05. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I usually do, with a summary of first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.\nProperty casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.81. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items, added $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.67. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.33. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the first quarter to $75.43 per share.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. It's satisfying to see the steady execution of our initiatives producing these strong results. March and April brought a return of business travel and a return of our headquarters associates working together in person. It's wonderful to see so many familiar faces in the hallway and to be able to get out from behind our desk to visit with agents in our field teams across the country. This return to a bit of normalcy has produced an energy you can feel across our organization, bringing with it lots of optimism for the future of Cincinnati Financial.\nAs a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Jesse, please open the call for questions."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nDennis E. McDaniel\n\nVP & IR Officer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nHello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call.\nLate yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left.\nOn this call, you'll first hear from Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell.

Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. It's satisfying to see excellent operating results and overall financial performance in 2021 and for both the fourth quarter and full year. As usual, we face challenges, but our strategy continues to work well. thanks to outstanding efforts by our associates and the independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance.\nNet income for the fourth quarter rose $421 million compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $346 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter 2021 was up $58 million or 22% versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 96% higher than 2020. Our 84.2% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 3.1 percentage points better than last year with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 11 points of the improvement. An outstanding full year 2021 combined ratio of 88.3% was nearly 10 points better than last year with lower catastrophe losses representing 4.1 points of the improvement. The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 1.5 percentage points better than accident year 2020 measured at 12 months.\nWe believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain a 2022 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2022 property casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. Premium growth continued at a strong pace during the quarter, reflecting a strengthening economy generally steady pricing and the benefit of great relationships with our agents. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Pricing segmentation continues to be an emphasis with our underwriting working to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing. Renewal pricing during the fourth quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment.\nOur commercial lines Insurance segment again, experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases up a little for the third quarter. Our fourth quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the third quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment was near the low end of the high single-digit range. Our commercial lines segment had a superb year with its 83.8% combined ratio improving by 14.5 percentage points compared with 2020. and growing net written premiums by 8%.\nFor our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year, driven by planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full year 2021 combined ratio of 94.0% and improved 3.1 percentage points from a year ago, including an excellent 80.0% for the fourth quarter. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-90% combined ratio for the fourth quarter and the year and grew full year net written premiums by 22%, another terrific year.\nCincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had another year of healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 53% for the full year 2021 as reinsurance market conditions improved. It experienced a modest underwriting loss that included significant losses from Hurricane Ida. Those losses remain within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ida's magnitude based on our models. Cincinnati Global, its 2021 premiums by 6%, with a combined ratio below 90%. Our life insurance subsidiary generated full year 2021 net income of $44 million, up 38% from a year ago and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 7%.\nOn January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2022 are fairly similar to 2021. The main change for our property casualty treaty is retaining an additional $43 million of losses for the layers between $100 million and $600 million, while adding $47 million of coverage in a new layer between $800 million and $900 million. Rates for our property casualty treaties generally rose in the high single-digit range. We expect 2022 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $110 million, about 3% higher than last year.\nI'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results measured as net income before investment gains and improved valuation of our investment portfolio, each made large contributions to VCR for both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. With VCR of 12.1% for the quarter, VCR for the full year was 25.7%, far exceeding our average annual target range of 10% to 13%.\nNow our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on some other important aspects of our financial performance.\n\nMichael James Sewell\n\nCFO, Principal Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow at a strong pace, up 8% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year 2021 compared with the same periods a year ago. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%, and net equity security purchases totaled $177 million for the year. Bond interest income grew 4% in the fourth quarter, while the pretax average yield of 4.05% for the year was down 1 basis point from a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the full year 2021 was 3.47%. Investing in fixed maturity securities continues to be a priority with net purchases during the year totaling $927 million.\nValuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock holdings in aggregate, but unfavorable for our bond holdings. The overall fourth quarter net gain was nearly $1.4 billion before tax effects despite a decrease of $82 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the fourth quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $8 billion, including $7.2 billion for our equity securities.\nCash flow was very strong in the fourth quarter as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 5% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2021 generated just shy of $2 billion, a 33% increase compared with a year ago. Expense management efforts in 2021 were very good, and we continue to carefully balance strategic business investments and expense controls.\nThe full year 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.5 percentage points lower than last year even with an increase of 0.7 points from higher accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During full year 2021, we experienced $428 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 7.0%. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserves developed for the year was favorable by $283 million for 2020, $56 million for 2019, $44 million for 2018 and $45 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. We believe overall reserves remain adequate. During 2021, net loss and loss expense reserves in total increased by 8%. The IBNR portion increased by 6% in 2021 and which followed an increase of 18% in 2020 for IBNR.\nTurning to capital management. We also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our year-end financial strength remained in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 866,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.56.\nI'll conclude my prepared remarks as I typically do, with a summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.26. Life insurance operations increased book value of $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items included $0.98. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.35. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $6.93, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $8.23 per share during the fourth quarter to a record $81.72 per share.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\n\nSteven Justus Johnston\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, 2021 ended with many positives. We again achieved excellent premium growth and completed a tenth straight year of underwriting profit. We extended our record of annual dividend increases to 61 years and have already set the stage for a second -- 62nd year. Earlier this month, AM Best recognized our capital strength and strong operating trends by affirming our A+ financial strength rating with a stable outlook. The key to our consistent results lies with our associates, who deliver who continue to deliver outstanding service to our agents and their clients, deepening our relationships with our agents and executing on our strategies for long-term success.\nBefore we open the call for questions, I want to take a minute to recognize Steve Spray's recent promotion to President of the Cincinnati Insurance Company and all of our U.S. subsidiary companies. This promotion is a natural next step in the evolution of our executive leadership team that began several years ago. Because he's been in leadership roles across our organization, Steve has a deep understanding of what it will take to succeed far into the future. I'm confident that under his direction, our insurance subsidiaries will continue to grow deepening the products, services and capabilities we have to support our agents and create shareholder value. As a reminder, with Mike, Steve and me today are Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer.\nJoanna, please open the call for questions."

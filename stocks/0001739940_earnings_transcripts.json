[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.\nWe'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ann Dennison, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn our remarks today, David, Brian and Ann will cover a number of topics, including our third quarter 2025 financial results and our financial outlook for 2025. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Ann will be available for Q&A.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the signagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2025 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nRegarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded a net after-tax special item benefit of $61 million or $0.23 per share. Additional details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2025 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2025 dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. In a highly disruptive market at The Cigna Group, we continue our track record of sustained growth in 2025, and I'm pleased to report that in the third quarter, The Cigna Group delivered strong results and continue -- in a continued dynamic environment.\nToday, I'll briefly walk through how we will sustain our growth by accelerating innovation to meet the needs of our customers, clients and partners. We're also introducing new solutions to create meaningful value and impact, including our announcement earlier this week of a new rebate free model for pharmacy benefits. Then Brian will provide an update on our performance on our growth platforms as well as provide some perspective on 2026. Then Ann will share some more details on our financial results for the quarter. Then we'll open up for your questions.\nNow let's get started. Third quarter, we delivered revenue of $69.7 billion and adjusted earnings of $7.83 per share, all while continuing to strategically invest in our business to drive growth and innovation. We've also taken further strategic actions to expand our addressable markets and position the company for future growth. One example is our recent investment in Shields Health Solutions completed earlier in September. Brian will share more details on this shortly.\nOur performance this quarter also underscores that we continue to deliver for those we serve, consistently navigating through dynamic and challenging environments. For example, this year alone, we publicly committed in February to a series of actions to further ease access to care in a coordinated way for patients and the physicians. Then we step forward to partner with HHS Secretary Kennedy and CMS Administrator Oz, along with others, on a broad set of initiatives that will create a more seamless access to care environment and care continuity for Americans, for example, when they switch health plans.\nAdditionally, earlier this month, Evernorth fertility pharmacies work with the Trump administration and EMD Serono to make fertility treatments more accessible for Americans struggling to start or expand the families. And just this week, we announced our transformative new rebate-free delinked model. Our pharmacy benefit services here are designed to improve health care affordability and the experience for tens of millions of Americans.\nOur durable business model is designed to evolve, flex and thrive through a variety of changes, whether anomic, regulatory, legislative or evolving technologies. Today, the powerful forces of change across health care are accelerating and converging around long-standing challenges, particularly balancing access and affordability for consumers and patients. Drug pricing continues to create a significant affordability challenge and has become an even more intense part of the public dialogue in 2025.\nOne area where we've helped address affordability relates to generic drugs with Americas today enjoying the lowest prices in the world for these medications. In fact, generic drugs now account for 90% of all prescriptions. And on average, they are 1/3 cheaper than in the United States than in other countries. And pharmacy benefit managers and the industry as a whole have played a key role in contributing to these lower costs by leveraging a competitive environment for clinically equivalent drugs.\nNow on the other hand, prices for brand-name medications continued to skyrocket. With those drugs that do not have a generic equivalent costing 4x as much as the same drug in European markets. And in 2025, it's estimated that the median price set by drug companies for new FDA-approved drugs is projected to be approximately $390,000 per treatment course. As a result of these marketplace dynamics, even though brand name drug medications comprise only 10% of overall pharmaceutical volumes in the United States, they account for 80% of the spend.\nIn recent weeks, President Trump announced a series of initiatives aimed at lowering the cost of brand name medications, bringing the U.S. prices in line with those paid in other developed countries. We are aligned with these efforts and seek to expand access for all our clients, from employers to health plans and governmental plans so that even more Americans can benefit from fair pricing on the prescriptions.\nAdditionally, similar to our work to reduce pricing in generics, we continue to advocate for necessary changes to accelerate and broaden access to biosimilars, which boosts competition and lowers prices further. For example, the list price of HUMIRA is approximately $7,000 a month. That approaches $85,000 a year for this single medication. Thanks to our innovative offering, we provide customers with HUMIRA at a biosimilar level at no cost to the individual consumer.\nFrom a consumer point of view, that's real value and that's innovation that matters. Even with these efforts, we continue to advance change for the benefit of our customers, clients and patients. We've deliberately shaped our well-balanced portfolio of businesses across 2 growth platforms at The Cigna Group, Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth Health Services. As a reminder, Cigna Healthcare is approximately 40% of our enterprise earnings. And in Evernorth, Specialty & Care and pharmacy benefit services are approximately 30% each.\nSo 70% of our portfolio, Cigna Healthcare and Specialty and Care Services remain well positioned for growth in 2026 and beyond. And to future-proof our company within our pharmacy benefit services, we continue to take significant actions. First, we proactively secured a number of long-term large client renewals and extensions including the U.S. Department of Defense, Prime Therapeutics and Centene. We're pleased to be able to serve them and their customers and patients now and through the end of the decade and beyond.\nSecond, we've stepped forward with our new simple and transparent model for pharmacy benefit services, which will replace the complex post-purchase rebate process with a simple upfront discount, which will enable customers and patients to automatically pay the lowest price at the counter, whether through their benefit or on a cash pay basis and apply the payments or the deductible. And importantly, continue to provide approximately 18,000 clinical safety checks as well as care coordination programs, which are essential for Americans who are taking multiple prescription medications that may have dangerous interactions.\nTo make the benefits of this model even more evident, consider this, for Americans and health plans where they pay the full cost of medications, including, for example, high deductible plans, our new model will reduce the cost for a brand-name drug prescription on average 30%. This will be real savings for the consumers, and they'll see it right at the counter. Cigna Healthcare will adopt this model 100% for fully insured lives beginning in 2027, and it will become our standard offering broadly for The Cigna group to the marketplace starting in January 2028 and we expect to transition at least 50% of our book of business into this new model by the end of 2028.\nConsistent with this direction, we are also creating a more sustainable economic model for independent pharmacists we contract with. We understand the critical role these clinicians play in health care, particularly in rural at-risk communities and commit to continuing to support them with fair competitive pricing reimbursements for dispensing medications as well as clinical services they provide for customers and patients.\nFurther, the combination of market forces and our capabilities position us to proactively drive these long-term strategic renewals, extensions and program transformations to positively impact the marketplace for years to come.\nNow over the next 2 years, we will invest to support these renewals extensions and innovations. These investments will support recontracting efforts cross many clients and supply chain partners, technology improvements, process reengineering as well as building a further enhancing data and analytical capabilities. Additionally, given the significant financial and affordability pressures for partners operating heavily in government programs, we have proactively improved the economic terms of the contracts for the benefit of these long-term strategic clients.\nAs a result of these factors, we expect margin pressure within our Pharmacy Benefit Services segment over the next 2 years. To be clear, we expect a sustained and durable growth trajectory over the long term for the business. I also want to be clear, even with these significant investments, we expect to grow EPS in 2026. Brian will discuss this further in a few minutes when he addresses our tailwinds and headwinds. All these actions demonstrate the commitment and resolve from The Cigna Group to build a better future and sustain our growth and impact.\nNow to wrap up, against the backdrop of a dynamic and challenging environment, our third quarter results and our reaffirmed EPS outlook of at least $29.60 underscores the strength of our diverse portfolio of businesses and sustained disciplined execution and focus.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by emphasizing our continued performance and delivery through a dynamic operating environment. Our strong fundamentals, disciplined focus on execution and innovative mindset position us to continue demonstrating leadership for the benefit of those we serve and to build a more sustainable model for health care. Our continued success is rooted in the reasons our clients choose to partner with us, our breadth of capabilities, our clinical excellence and our benefit plan administration. Taken together, our expertise in these areas enables us to provide access to quality health services and prescription drugs at lower unit costs than clients could achieve on their own, helping them meet their affordability goals, programs and services that deliver personalized care and prioritize patient safety and efficient and effective management of their complex benefit plans.\nToday, I'm going to cover 2 things. First, I will go through our third quarter performance across our businesses, and then I'll touch briefly on the tailwinds and headwinds we see for 2026.\nLet's begin with our performance in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth Health Services delivered earnings in line with expectations in the third quarter. Our Specialty and Care Services businesses had another strong quarter where we delivered 11% adjusted earnings growth, reflecting our ability to deliver meaningful value to those we serve. Already this year, our specialty pharmacies have delivered approximately 7 million prescriptions, growing at a double-digit rate from last year. And we are continuing to see a strong shift to biosimilars for HUMIRA and STELARA, saving patients millions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs. This quarter, we also completed a strategic investment in Shields Health Solutions, further expanding our existing specialty capabilities to serve health systems, hospitals and other providers. We're excited about the multiple future opportunities in the over $400 billion specialty market.\nWith our investment shields, we are enhancing our ability to serve the provider administered portion of the specialty market, which today represents approximately 40% of the specialty space. This addressable market has strong secular growth and our investment in Shields will enable us to accelerate our strategy in the hospital and health systems segment that Shield serves. We're also pleased to be part of an effort by the Trump administration to make fertility treatments more affordable for Americans.\nAs David noted, earlier this month, we announced that in conjunction with the launch of TrumpRx, we will expand our successful partnership with EMD Serono to deliver fertility treatments from our Evernorth fertility pharmacies in 2026, providing lower cost and differentiated clinical capabilities for the benefit of patients. All in, we see a number of growth opportunities in our Specialty and Care Services business. With our combined suite of capabilities across Accredo, CuraScript SD and CarepathRx, we have opportunities to enhance and expand the ways we support specialty for all stakeholders.\nNow I'll turn to our second major platform within Evernorth, our Pharmacy Benefit Services business. We are proactively transforming our pharmacy benefits model to meet the demands of the market and improve affordability and experiences for our customers and patients. We're also seeing strong client retention and demand for our services. And as the 2026 selling season comes to a close, we expect approximately 97% retention in our Pharmacy Benefit Services business.\nDuring 2025, we proactively executed renewals and extensions with our largest clients, including Prime Therapeutics and Centene, building on our previous extension with the Department of Defense. We recognize there are significant financial and affordability pressures for partners operating heavily in the government programs market. We have proactively improved the economic terms of the contracts for the benefit of these long-term strategic clients. We're pleased to have these partnerships secured through the end of the decade, given their attractive long-term economics. Separately, we're also continuing to see positive impact from our suite of GLP-1 offerings, EncircleRx, EnReachRx and the new and Guide pharmacy. These offerings are anchored around affordability, access, clinical support and patient safety. This includes access to FDA-approved medicines, prioritizing adherence, hopper dosing and a focus on diet and exercise to ensure durable lasting results for our patients.\nAcross Evernorth, we had a solid quarter as we continue to grow our specialty and care capabilities and invest in our Pharmacy Benefit Services model, strengthening our leadership position and delivering solutions for the future. In Cigna Healthcare, we delivered financial results that were in line with expectations, underscoring the resilience of our portfolio and business mix, even in an environment of persistently elevated medical costs. This performance reflects our ability to navigate dynamic market conditions while delivering on our commitments to those we serve, along with targeted customer growth, including an 8% increase in our under 500 Select segment, and continued strong performance in international health.\nAs it relates to the medical care ratio, we were pleased with solid performance in the quarter from our U.S. employer business, including stop loss, which performed in line with expectations. Our overall Cigna Healthcare segment-wide medical care ratio was 84.8% for the quarter, driven by an updated view of risk adjustment in our individual exchange business. Across all of our Cigna Healthcare customers and clients, bending the cost curve and delivering affordability is more critical than ever.\nAs I noted, our clinical expertise and support programs are key reasons why our clients choose to partner with us. We're investing in predictive capabilities that allow us to engage our customers at the right time to support their care needs more effectively. We also enable clients and customers to access high-performing providers through value-based reimbursement models that align incentives and drive better outcomes. In Cigna Healthcare, we're proud to have delivered another solid quarter, fueled by the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our operational focus.\nNext, I'll share a view of some of the tailwinds and headwinds we anticipate for 2026. Notable tailwinds include continued strong growth of our Specialty and Care businesses, including our investment in in partnership with Shields Health Solutions. In Cigna Healthcare, consistent with prior commentary, we took corrective action to reprice the stop loss business beginning early this year and expect to benefit from margin expansion within that business in 2026.\nTurning to headwinds. In Evernorth, the aforementioned renewals and extensions will generate a modified margin profile going forward for these large clients. And our new rebate-free pharmacy benefits model will incur short-term investment and transition costs, including for technology and operational reconfiguration as we accelerate transformative change. And within Cigna Healthcare, the absence of nonrecurring benefits in 2025, specifically related to our divested Medicare businesses as well as our individual exchange business.\nTaking these factors altogether, overall, we expect EPS growth in 2026. In Evernorth, we expect operating income to be slightly down in 2026. Our Specialty and Care Services business will grow income towards the higher end of its long-term growth target, offset by a decline in Pharmacy Benefit Services. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect operating income to grow towards the higher end of its long-term growth target.\nAs I wrap up, I'd like to reiterate some bright spots for the quarter. We continue to deliver strong business performance and operational execution even in a dynamic environment. Evernorth continues to see strong growth in specialty, and we delivered 11% adjusted earnings growth within Specialty and Care services, reflecting the strength of our capabilities and clinical expertise. We're proactively bringing market-leading innovations such as our new rebate-free de-linked fee-based pharmacy benefits model that will deliver more value to customers and clients and simplify our economic model.\nWe've also extended our relationships with our 3 largest Evernorth clients through the end of the decade, providing further multiyear predictability. And Cigna Healthcare is successfully navigating a dynamic environment and delivering on our financial commitments, with notable strong medical customer growth in our select segment. Overall, we remain confident in the growth opportunities ahead, supported by strong fundamentals and secular tailwinds that position us to deliver even greater value for our customers clients and shareholders.\nNow I'll turn it over to Ann.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nSenior VP, Controller & CAO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review Cigna's third quarter 2025 results and discuss our outlook for the full year, which we reaffirmed this morning. As David and Brian mentioned, our strong third quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute and deliver on our financial commitments in a dynamic environment.\nKey consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter include: revenues of $69.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.83. Our performance through the first 3 quarters gives us the confidence to deliver on our full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $29.60.\nNow turning to our segment results. I will start with Evernorth. Third quarter 2025 revenues grew to $60.4 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew to $1.9 billion, in line with expectations. Specialty and Care Services continues to deliver strong growth with revenues up 10% to $26.3 billion and pretax adjusted earnings up 11% to $928 million, consistent with expectations. This performance reflects strong specialty volume growth and increased biosimilar adoption.\nWe continue to see drugs used to treat inflammatory conditions, advanced pulmonary conditions, rare diseases and infertility as some of the drug classes that have seen the largest increases in utilization. As these trends continue, we remain well positioned to build on this momentum leveraging our expertise in specialty to drive affordability and strong clinical outcomes for our clients and patients.\nIn our Pharmacy Benefit Services business, revenues were $34.1 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $1 billion, in line with expectations. Pharmacy Benefit Services results in the third quarter reflect the rate and pace of investments including initiatives to improve the patient experience and accelerated biosimilar adoption, consistent with our prior commentary. Taken together, we are pleased with the performance of Evernorth in the third quarter.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Third quarter 2025 revenues were $10.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1 billion. Cigna Healthcare pretax adjusted earnings were in line with expectations. Overall, results in our U.S. employer business, including stop loss and our international business were consistent with expectations, while our individual business had an impact on our medical care ratio of 84.8%, reflecting an updated view of risk adjustment revenue. The higher medical care ratio in the quarter was offset by operating cost efficiencies.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2025. Given the strength of our results through the first 3 quarters, we have the confidence to reaffirm our full year 2025 expectation for consolidated adjusted earnings per share of at least $29.60. Our full year 2025 outlook for pretax adjusted earnings for each of our reporting segments remains unchanged. In Cigna Healthcare, we now expect our full year medical care ratio to be at the high end of our full year guidance range of 83.2% to 84.2%. This is driven by a higher expected MCR in our individual business.\nTurning to our 2025 capital management position. Third quarter operating cash flow was $3.4 billion, and we continue to expect strong cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, similar to the pattern we observed last year. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 44.9% as of September 30, 2025. The increase primarily reflects the impact of debt issuance associated with our investment in Shields Health Solutions. We continue to target a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%, and we expect to progress towards this target in the fourth quarter.\nLooking ahead to 2026, we expect another year of strong growth in Cigna Healthcare and Specialty & Care services, both at the higher end of our respective long-term growth target. And as David and Brian mentioned, we are proud to lead the industry with the proactive transformation of our new rebate-free pharmacy benefit model, which positions us for durable and sustainable long-term growth.\nDue to the deliberate investments we anticipate making to implement this new model and the renewals and extensions of our largest clients, we expect adjusted operating income and pharmacy benefit services to decline in 2026.\nRegarding our capital management position, we expect cash flow from operations in 2026 to be back half weighted, consistent with the 2025 pattern. Taken together, we expect EPS to grow in 2026. We look forward to providing further details on our 2026 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ann Dennison, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn our remarks today, David, Brian and Ann will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter 2025 financial results and our financial outlook for 2025. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Ann will be available for Q&A.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com.\nWe use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2025 and future performance.

A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nRegarding our results in the second quarter, we recorded net after-tax special item charges of $171 million or $0.64 per share. Additional details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement.\nAdditionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2025 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2025 dividends.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.\nWe entered the second quarter with momentum, and I'm pleased to report that The Cigna Group delivered another quarter of differentiated financial results. And recognizing the meaningful disruption in the industry, we're also pleased to reaffirm our guidance for full year 2025.\nAt The Cigna Group, we continue to meet our financial commitments by delivering innovative new solutions to improve access and affordability for customers and patients and working to build a better, more sustainable health care model. At the same time, we also remain laser-focused on delivering every day for the benefit of those we serve.\nToday, for our discussion, briefly, I'll discuss how the strength and durable nature of our model enables us to continue to grow. Then Brian will discuss the performance of our growth platforms and how we continue to expand our total addressable market. After that, Ann will provide details on our financial performance in the quarter, and we'll take your questions.\nSo let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered $67.2 billion in total revenue and grew adjusted earnings per share to $7.20. This builds on our long track record of sustained attractive results, where over the average of each of the last 3, 5 and 10 years, we've achieved our growth algorithm of 10% to 14% compounded adjusted EPS growth.\nOur results are a direct reflection of our clear and deliberate strategy to position The Cigna Group with differentiated services and integrated benefit capabilities, coupled with strong execution and led by the most tenured and capable leadership team in the industry.\nAt a macro level, we continue to operate with the assumption that the environment will remain dynamic. We see eroding health status, affordability and access challenges as key forces of change in the health care system in the U.S. and around the globe. In addition, we have operated in and will continue to operate in this space with elevated regulatory and legislative activity as well as significant technological, clinical and pharmacological advances.\nWe have a number of differentiators, which enable us to lead through these dynamic markets. The first is our orientation toward anticipating, and in some instances, creating constructive disruption, which better positions us to identify opportunities. This is a foundational part of our strategy. For us, it means listening to our customers, patients and clients and leveraging their feedback to continue to evolve, innovate and deliver even more value.\nFor example, as we stepped into 2025, the forces of change in health care further accelerated our efforts to help shape a more sustainable health care system, and in part, fueled our customer-focused commitments and actions we announced earlier this year. These commitments, which we refer to as our commitment to better, call on us to deliver easier access to care, better support to help customers and patients navigate the health care system, increase value, greater accountability and greater transparency.\nThis quarter, we took another step forward with Cigna Healthcare introducing a new AI-powered virtual assistant to improve our customers' experience during common interactions such as checking benefits, estimated costs and finding care.\nAs it relates to regulatory and legislative activity, we continue to proactively lean in with a partnership orientation. We continue to believe in and embrace public-private partnerships, which are essential for the health care system to continue to be responsive to all stakeholder needs. And we are proactively working to bring forward new solutions with the current administration, Congress and within states.\nThe recent industry announcement to further streamline and simplify prior authorizations for the benefit of patients and physicians is a good example of this, and we partnered closely with HHS on this advancement. Each of these actions represent a commitment from The Cigna Group to build a better future, and I'm pleased that we continue to make good progress.\nOur second differentiator is our diverse portfolio of businesses, which provides us with the strategic flexibility to pursue multiple avenues for delivering and capturing value. This is made possible by our service-based model, which provides us with significant amount of agility and nimbleness.\nWe've deliberately shaped our services-based model over years, and today, they are configured in 3 strong platforms that together provide us with a diversified position and multiple pathways for growth, serving employers, health plans, governmental agencies and health care delivery systems. In Evernorth, that includes Specialty and Care Services and our Pharmacy Benefit Services business; and in our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, our integrated benefits offerings, both in the United States and globally.\nOur proven approach leverages the combined strength and capabilities of these platforms to create even more value for the benefit of those we serve. Over the long term, the way we've architected our company, coupled with our strategic choices, including a capital-light model, has given us both the resilient model and the ability to pivot and evolve as the marketplace changes.\nNow a third key differentiator for us is our relentless execution fueled by our tenured and talented team. Ultimately, our results are made possible by our coworkers, including the most experienced enterprise leadership team in the industry. And along with the great depth and continuity of our leadership, we also continue to strategically infuse talent into our company in areas such as technology and clinical.\nThe strength of our team continues to be a key differentiator in our ability to consistently execute on our strategy and deliver on our core fundamentals. Our team's deep expertise in the health care industry and strong understanding of the competitive landscape enables us to adapt quickly. This strategic agility helps us navigate challenging environments as well as to identify and seize new opportunities for growth.\nWe have drawn upon each of these differentiators time and time again to continue to grow in times of uncertainty, from the launch of the ACA to leading through the global pandemic. And during each of these events, we have sought to innovate through and deliver sustainable value for our customers, patients, clients and shareholders. As a result, we've delivered 13% compounded adjusted EPS CAGR over the last decade.\nNow to wrap up my comments. Against the backdrop of a dynamic environment, we continued to deliver and are well positioned for the remainder of 2025. Our second quarter results underscore the strength of our diverse portfolio of businesses and our disciplined focus on innovation and partnership.\nWe are confident in our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 14% compounded adjusted EPS growth over the strategic horizon, along with an attractive dividend.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone.\nTo underscore David's comments, we continued to execute well and delivered against our customer and shareholder commitments through a dynamic operating environment.\nOur capabilities across our 3 platforms, Cigna Healthcare, Evernorth Pharmacy Benefit Services and Evernorth Specialty and Care Services, uniquely positions us in the market with strong assets and expertise. Across our portfolio, we are leaders in serving employers, health plans and government entities. And we are increasingly entrusted to service health systems, hospitals and other providers with our Evernorth Specialty and Care Services capabilities.\nNow let me go a bit deeper on our second quarter business performance. Beginning with Cigna Healthcare, Cigna Healthcare delivered financial results that were in line with expectations even as we've seen persistently elevated medical costs throughout the year. Importantly, our flagship U.S. employer business continues to grow, particularly in our Select segment through a consultative approach with clients.\nOverall, our performance reflects a medical care ratio of 83.2% in the second quarter. This is in line with expectations, driven by our sustained disciplined execution against our commitments.\nAnd we have intentionally positioned our Cigna Healthcare portfolio with a product mix that has proven favorable in the current environment as we have no exposure to Medicaid or Medicare, instead choosing to serve these customers through our Evernorth services portfolio. Our planning assumption within Cigna Healthcare for 2025 is that we will continue to experience elevated medical costs throughout the year.\nWithin the second quarter, we experienced pressures in our individual exchange business that we were able to overcome due to the strength of our broader Cigna Healthcare portfolio and the relatively small scale of our individual exchange business within that portfolio as a result of strategic choices we've made to reposition this product offering.\nTurning to Evernorth. Earnings were slightly ahead of expectations. This reflects our strong momentum within the Specialty and Care Services platform, coupled with continued good execution within Pharmacy Benefit Services.\nIn our Pharmacy Benefit Services business, we continued to see strong client retention with demand across diverse buyer groups, from employers to health plans and other PBMs. And today, we are proud to serve more than 120 million Americans. This includes long-standing client and partner relationships, many of them being the largest and most sophisticated purchasers in the U.S. who come to us for solutions that help them best serve their needs.\nThis demand for our services has resulted in a number of multiyear renewals and other ongoing agreements with large clients. For example, we recently finalized a multiyear contract extension with Prime Therapeutics.\nOur clients also look to us for partnership around innovation. This quarter, Evernorth launched another first-of-its-kind benefit option that will save patients money on their GLP-1 weight loss prescriptions with greater choice and predictability. Building on our Encircle and EnReach offerings, this new benefit, negotiated directly with 2 drug manufacturers, limits the patient's out-of-pocket cost to no more than $200 per month and applies to their annual deductible. This benefit offers our clients flexibility to cover these medicines in multiple ways to best serve customers. As always, we continuously explore new approaches and models to drive greater access, affordability and transparency.\nAnd in our Evernorth Specialty and Care Services businesses, we delivered another quarter of strong growth, led by Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy, which provides specialty medications for the treatment of complex and rare diseases.\nAcross the Specialty and Care Services portfolio, adjusted earnings increased 12% in the quarter when normalizing for the absence of the VillageMD dividend. This was driven by increased specialty prescription volume and ongoing biosimilar adoption, further powered by the strong secular tailwinds that we've discussed on prior calls.\nFinally, our specialty distribution business serving health systems, hospitals and other providers delivered significant growth in the quarter. And our ability to serve these buyers with both distribution and our unique set of broader enablement capabilities drives future expansion opportunities.\nI'm going to spend a few minutes unpacking this theme further. David talked earlier about our ability to find opportunities in a challenging environment to expand our addressable markets. Previously, we highlighted how our specialty pharmacy business uniquely supports patients through Accredo and our other pharmacies with our clinical expertise and services such as our in-home nurses. Today, I want to share a bit more about the important addressable market expansion opportunity we see serving health systems, hospitals and other providers with our specialty services across The Cigna Group.\nAs a reminder, the specialty space is more than a $400 billion market today and is growing at high single digits annually. In 2024, approximately 70% of new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were specialty medications. These medicines flow through both the pharmacy and medical benefit with the medical benefits segment representing about 40% of the specialty space.\nSpecialty represents one of the highest growth areas in health care and within The Cigna Group, and we continue to expect long-term average annual income growth of 8% to 11% across our specialty portfolio.\nIncreasingly, health systems and other providers are seeking to manage their in-house pharmacy capabilities and inventory, most specifically within specialty drugs as this provides an important source of revenue that can help to counterbalance pressures in other aspects of their business.\nLet me outline a few of the unique capabilities within Evernorth that position us to provide innovative solutions and support health systems, hospitals and other providers as they seek to optimize their specialty pharmacy management.\nFirst, across the supply chain, we can help health systems and providers procure specialty medicines, including highly complex and limited distribution therapies. Our specialty distribution serves more than 12,000 providers today, distributing some of the most complex and critical medications to physician offices, health systems and infusion centers. We do this through CuraScript SD, which has seen double-digit average revenue growth over the past 3 years and is now a $25 billion business.\nSecond, our technology suite of services can support providers and hospitals as they navigate this complex specialty market.\nAnd finally, bringing our exceptional range of clinical services to these buyers provides them with peace of mind and the assurance that best practices are being drawn from across our client base. We offer specialty pharmacy and infusion services on behalf of more than 700 hospitals, health systems and physician groups across the country, helping them expand their ability to offer coordinated access and continuity of care. Whether at home at the pharmacy or in a physician office or hospital, we are built to serve the needs of patients in any setting, delivering greater affordability and better clinical care. Overall, we see the opportunity to serve health systems and other providers holistically as a meaningful growth opportunity.\nAs I wrap up, I want to reiterate some notable bright spots for the quarter that underscore our strong business performance and operational execution. Cigna Healthcare earnings were solid and reflect the strength of our diverse portfolio and intentional choices around product offerings.\nWe continued our strong track record of client retention with large strategic client renewals in our Evernorth Pharmacy Benefit Services segment.\nWe delivered 12% growth in normalized earnings within our Evernorth Specialty and Care Services operating segment, which has attractive growth exposure over the long term, particularly with health systems, hospitals and other providers.\nWe continue to drive net growth in the U.S. employer select segment within Cigna Healthcare.\nAnd our ongoing innovation for clients includes new enhancements in the quarter associated with GLP-1s in Evernorth and an AI-powered virtual assistant within Cigna Healthcare.\nAcross our businesses, I'm excited about the ongoing growth opportunities we have. Now I'll turn it over to Ann.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nSenior VP, Controller & CAO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review Cigna's second quarter 2025 results and discuss our outlook for the full year, which we reaffirmed this morning.\nAs David and Brian mentioned, our second quarter results underscore the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses in a dynamic environment and demonstrate continued execution against our operating and financial commitments.\nKey consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter include revenue of $67.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.20.\nOur solid performance and disciplined execution in the first half of the year reinforce our confidence in delivering our full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $29.60.\nNow turning to our segment results. I will start by commenting on Evernorth, our services chassis, which now contributes over 60% of our enterprise earnings. Evernorth's results reflect sustained strength across our Pharmacy Benefit Services business and Specialty and Care Services business.\nSecond quarter 2025 revenues grew to $57.8 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew to $1.7 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. Specialty and Care Services demonstrated strong growth with revenue up 13% to $25.9 billion. Normalizing for the impact of lower net investment income due to the absence of the VillageMD dividend, pretax adjusted earnings increased 12% year-over-year.\nThis performance showcases the power of our robust and unique specialty capabilities as we delivered broad-based growth across both Accredo and CuraScript.\nPharmacy Benefit Services delivered another quarter of solid growth. Pretax adjusted earnings increased to $833 million as we continued to drive affordability for our patients, customers and clients through innovative product offerings while continuing to invest to drive long-term growth.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2025 revenues were $10.8 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion. And the medical care ratio was 83.2%.\nThese results were broadly in line with expectations and reinforced the strength and stability of our portfolio of businesses, which, as David mentioned, was strategically constructed for sustainable long-term growth in a dynamic environment.\nCost trends for our commercial business, including Stop Loss, remained elevated in the quarter, consistent with expectations.\nFor our individual business, utilization was higher than expected, reflecting an increase in medical costs across the ACA marketplace. However, this pressure was manageable due to the smaller relative size of our ACA book, aided by our disciplined pricing actions over the past 2 years.\nOverall, Cigna Healthcare delivered consistent results, underscoring the strength of our execution in an environment that continues to present challenges across the industry.\nNow turning to our outlook for the full year 2025. Recognizing the overall disruption in the industry, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year 2025 expectation for consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $29.60 per share.\nRegarding the cadence of earnings, we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be slightly above 25% of the full year outlook.\nNow turning to our 2025 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2025 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $7.2 billion, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings for Evernorth to be slightly above 25% of the full year outlook.\nFor Cigna Healthcare, our outlook continues to assume elevated cost trends to persist throughout the year. We continue to expect full year 2025 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $4.125 billion, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings for Cigna Healthcare to be slightly below 25% of the full year outlook.\nWe continue to expect the full year medical care ratio within the range of 83.2% to 84.2%. Additionally, we expect the third quarter medical care ratio to be toward the upper end of the full year range, reflecting typical seasonality.\nTurning to our 2025 capital management position. It's important to note that our operating cash flow can vary from quarter-to-quarter, influenced by timing-specific factors such as the payment of supply chain receivables and payables as well as changes in inventory levels, particularly within Accredo and CuraScript.\nSecond quarter operating cash flow was impacted by working capital timing within Evernorth. We expect the timing-related impact to reverse and continue to anticipate strong cash flow generation in the second half.\nNow to recap. Our first half 2025 results reflect disciplined execution across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2025 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our growth platforms, which gives us the confidence to reaffirm our full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $29.60.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the [indiscernible] are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian [ Evanko], President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ann Dennison, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn our remarks today, David, Brian and Ann will cover a number of topics, including our first quarter 2025 financial results and our financial outlook for 2025. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Ann will be available for Q&A.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2025 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nRegarding our results in the first quarter, we recorded net after-tax special item charges of $229 million or $0.84 per share. This included an after-tax special item charge of $163 million or $0.63 per share related to a strategic optimization program to further leverage the company's ongoing operational efficiency initiatives.\nAdditional details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2025 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and in [ paid ] 2025 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We begin 2025 with momentum, and I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, the Cigna Group [ hedge ] results while we continue to focus on delivering on our commitments to build a better, more sustainable health care model.\nJoining me on the call is Brian [ Beko], our President and Chief Operating Officer, and I also want to welcome Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer. As you likely saw Brian and Ann were named to these new roles in March.\nWith the announcement, we'll be filing a [indiscernible] form for our call this morning. I'll share some brief comments and focus on our performance and how we're leading to address [indiscernible] stakeholder needs. Then Brian will discuss the key business drivers fueling our growth, and Ann will provide more detail on our financial results, and then we'll take your questions.\nTo start today, I'm pleased to report that we delivered $65.5 billion in total revenue and we grew adjusted earnings per share to $6.74 this quarter. And we are also raising our full year EPS guidance estimate to at least $29.60.\nWe delivered this performance in a dynamic environment with [indiscernible] a change going beyond tariffs and trade, significant geopolitical and evolving social impacts. At the Cigna Group, our market-leading capabilities and flexible model has fueled our consistent track record of delivering differentiated value, innovating and smartly expanding our addressable markets, driving sustained long-term growth even in the most disruptive environments.\nWeather measured over the last 3, 5 or 10 years, we've performed and delivered on our EPS growth algorithm. We've been able to deliver these competitively attractive results through a relentless approach to position our company to lead through the forces of change in health care.\nWe all know the health care system is on an unsustainable trajectory. Annual U.S. health care expenditures now exceed $4.5 trillion, and society's growing needs are overwhelming the current system remains primarily oriented to providing interventions after someone becomes ill.\nAll of these dynamics, particularly were matched against the current economic, geopolitical and social environment are in strong demand for strategic partners that could help individuals, employers, governmental agencies, health plans and integrated health care delivery systems to achieve both their short- and long-term goals.\nThe engines for converting these opportunities into differentiated results are our 2 growth platforms. Evernorth, our Health Services portfolio and Cigna Healthcare, our integrated benefits portfolio. Together, the businesses across these platforms are leveraging the breadth of our core strengths and the power of our capabilities to create and capture more value than any one business could achieve alone.\nImportantly, we also continue to shape our portfolio with strategic acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. The recently completed sale of our Medicare business, [ HGSC ] is the last quarter is the most recent example that demonstrates our disciplined execution of our capital management strategy.\nNow while we've long been on the path to evolve and drive continuous improvement as we stepped into 2025, the forces of change in health care further strengthened our urgency and resolve and in part fueled customer-focused commitments and series of actions we announced earlier this year to address some of the most pressing challenges in health care in 5 key areas.\nFirst, access. We are addressing the challenges customers and patients face in getting care and making our processes simpler and faster. Second is support. Helping our customers and patients with enhanced resources to navigate the health care system with greater ease and peace of mind.\nNext is value, working to further lower cost for our customers and patients. Fourth is accountability. Our promise to stand behind our commitments, specifically by tying our leadership compensation to improving customer and patient satisfaction. And finally, transparency, we will publicly share our progress and improvements to serve our customers and patients as we go forward. These actions represent yet another significant commitment from The Cigna Group to build a better future, and I'm pleased we are already making good progress.\nNow to wrap up my comments. Against the backdrop that is dynamic and challenging, we are well positioned for a strong 2025. Our first quarter results underscore the momentum we're building and our resilience as we continue to drive growth and invest for the long term. And we are confident in our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 14% compounded EPS growth over the strategic horizon, along with providing an attractive dividend. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, David. Before getting into our business performance, I'd like to share a few thoughts on the new roles that were announced in March for Ann and myself. I'm humbled and grateful to be named as President and COO of The Cigna Group.\nMy new team's primary focus will be on driving profitable growth for the company, while making health care better for our primary stakeholders, most notably customers, patients, clients and health care professional partners. I'm also thrilled to pass the reins of our finance function over to Ann, who is an accomplished and strategic financial leader.\nOver the past several weeks, as I've transitioned to the new role, I have spent meaningful time meeting with a number of our clients and partners and some key insights were reinforced through these engagements. First, our clients and partners consistently point to the attractive breadth and depth of our services and expertise across our Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Health care portfolio to solve their most pressing health care needs.\nFor example, in Evernorth Specialty and Care Services businesses, representing about 30% of the company's income today, we have unique capabilities in this fast-growing sector that others can't match. Last year, we delivered more than 8 million prescriptions to over 1 million patients through our owned operational assets and capabilities, including safely mixing and preparing medications in sterile environments that take years to build and fully license.\nThis business represents one of the company's top growth opportunities going forward in a space with high secular growth rates. Specialty drugs are clinically intensive, serving a relatively small number of patients who rely on them. Our patients clearly value the experience enabled by our clinicians, pharmacists and nurses, both in their home and over the phone. As we see 97% patient satisfaction rates on interactions with our credo nurses.\nIn Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefit services business, which also represents about 30% of the company's income, we are working tirelessly to lower prescription drug prices for more than 100 million Americans, and we saved about $38 billion for our clients last year. Unlike our lower-volume clinically-intensive specialty pharmacy business, our PBS business features much higher prescription volumes, including low-cost generics alongside the lower prices we negotiate for high list price branded drugs.\nFor example, we will process over 2 billion prescriptions in Express Scripts this year with around 90% of these being cost-effective generics. And finally, in Cigna Healthcare, where we generate about 40% of the Cigna Group's income. My recent engagements with some of our U.S. employer clients have underscored the value of our consultative client partnership model.\nThis has been further advanced by improving customer outcomes through better unit costs, site of care optimization and personalized clinical programs. And we continue to generate net growth rates that are well above the market in our under 500 Select segment, where we have now reached more than 3 million customers.\nFinally, I'm proud of the way all of my colleagues at the Cigna Group care deeply about those we serve. Our clients and partners appreciate the expertise of our team and the passion that they bring to our work to improve health care for all. As out to the future, I'm very excited about the growth opportunities we see across our businesses, while we remain focused on building a more sustainable model for health care.\nNow let me turn to the quarter in our business performance. Evernorth earnings were in line with expectations and revenues grew by double digits, led by our strong pharmacy benefit services and specialty pharmacy capabilities. Within Cigna Healthcare, we achieved strong revenue performance across our U.S. employer and international health businesses, driven by growth in our Select segment customers and strong rate execution.\nWe are also confident in our action plan to improve margins on our stop loss products, and we are pleased to see that the early indicators on 2025 stop-loss performance are tracking to expectations. Let me unpack these headlines more fully. Evernorth Specialty and Care Services businesses drove very strong growth in the first quarter with double-digit growth rates in both revenue and normalized earnings. And this space continues to represent one of the fastest-growing sectors in the industry.\nThe specialty pharmacy market continues to grow at an attractive pace as new specialty drugs are introduced existing medications are authorized for expanded indications and biosimilars become more prevalent. We are pleased with the further increased adoption of our interchangeable HUMIRA biosimilar. And this month, we are taking another step forward with an interchangeable STELARA biosimilar, which will also be available to eligible patients for 0 out of pocket.\nTurning to our pharmacy benefit services business. We drove attractive revenue growth of 14%, while balancing the need to continue investments for the long term. And while it's early into the 2026 selling season, we continue to see strong demand among existing and new clients. And we further increased investments in the pharmacy benefits business to drive even greater transparency and savings and to make the health care system work better for customers and patients.\nWe will soon be announcing enhancements to the patient experience with new flexible and personalized digital tools and capabilities. In Cigna Healthcare, our earnings exceeded expectations in the quarter, along with 9% revenue growth, powered by strong rate execution. We generated strong growth in our under 500 Select segment with customers growing 9% year-over-year, well above industry growth.\nAnd we continue to see further headroom for future customer growth given our market share is just 7% in this segment. And as David mentioned, we are laser-focused on the actions we announced earlier this year to improve the customer experience within Cigna HealthCare. The response to our proactive commitments has been very positive, with stakeholders appreciating the associated transparency and accountability.\nTo bring it all together, I'd like to share one specific example of how we continue to lead through the rapidly changing environment, with new innovations, leveraging our differentiated capabilities. The GLP-1 drug class is on pace to be the #1 drug trend driver for plans this year. In fact, for the average employer who provides access to GLP-1s for weight management, GLP-1s now represent about 3% of their total health care costs.\nAnd GLP-1s are now being prescribed beyond their original application for diabetes to include use for obesity and weight management and more recently for sleep apnea, with additional indications on the horizon. These treatment called once in a generation, and we all know they're changing lives of changing health care. By 2030, we expect the market size to exceed $100 billion in the U.S. alone. And [ one in 10 ] Americans is expected to be on a GLP-1 medication.\nBut the challenge of affordability, access and clinical coordination for GLP-1s in the U.S. remains. Clients are looking for ways to manage the high cost of these medicines while ensuring appropriate use and patients want to access these medications at an affordable price point and have a positive experience with the clinical support they need to achieve durable and impactful results.\nOur EnCircleRx solution provides a clinical program wrapper around the medication to help support sustainable and positive lifestyle changes for patients as well as improve affordability and access for clients. EnCircleRx now has approximately 9 million members enrolled.\nNow we're building on that success with the launch of additional innovations around GLP-1 access and affordability including our new [ Reach Rx ] solution, a high-touch patient support clinical model enabled by pharmacies committed to enhance clinical care for dispensing GLP-1 medicines. We also will offer a new specialized GLP-1 pharmacy called [ in Guide], which will go live for patients and clients next month. The combination of our pharmacy solutions further strengthens our position as a leader and innovator in this space by solving pharmacy, client and patient challenges.\nAs I wrap up my remarks, I'd like to reiterate a few points. We had a strong start to the year across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Some of the notable headlines from the quarter's performance include favorable [ MCR ] performance in Cigna Healthcare, leading to better-than-expected earnings. Strong growth in Cigna Healthcare Select segment customers, up 9% year-over-year.\nWithin Evernorth, we posted double-digit percentage growth in both revenue and normalized earnings within our high-growth specialty and care services operating segment and we had a strong start to the year in our pharmacy benefit services business, including double-digit revenue growth.\nWe delivered these strong results alongside making strategic investments for the longer term, including the customer provider-facing enhancements we committed to earlier this year. I'm excited by the numerous growth opportunities we have in the future and the enhancements we are making in order to improve the health care system for all. Now I'll turn it over to Ann to cover our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nSenior VP, Controller & CAO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to join you for my first earnings call as the CFO of The Cigna Group. Since joining me over a year ago, I have been inspired by the dedication and talent of our employees, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver value for our patients and customers and to achieve attractive long-term growth. I look forward to engaging with many of you over the coming months.\nAs Brian mentioned, we started the year with a strong first quarter performance ahead of expectations. Key consolidated financial highlights for the first quarter include revenue of $65.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.74.\nWith the first quarter results, we are raising our full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $29.60. This outlook reflects confidence in our businesses while maintaining a pit view of the current environment.\nNow turning to our segment results. I will first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results. First quarter 2025 revenues grew to $53.7 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew 5% and to $1.4 billion, in line with expectations.\nSpecialty & Care services showed strong growth with revenue up 19% to $239 billion. Normalizing for the impact of lower net investment income due to the absence of the VillageMD dividend, pretax adjusted earnings were up 11% year-over-year. This performance reflects the continued demand for specialty drugs as well as increased adoption of biosimilars.\nPharmacy Benefit Services also posted solid growth, reflecting strong client retention expansion of existing relationships and new business wins. Pretax adjusted earnings were up 4% to $544 million as our innovative capabilities continue to drive value and savings for our patients, customers and clients. Overall, we're pleased with Evernorth's first quarter results and confident about the long-term growth outlook for the underlying businesses.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. First quarter 2025 revenues were $14.5 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion. The medical care ratio for the first quarter was 82.2%. On March 19, we completed the divestiture of our Medicare businesses to [ HCSC]. This transaction closed about a month later than our financial planning assumptions. The timing of the closing modestly benefited our first quarter earnings, but had a greater impact on our medical care ratio as the Medicare businesses operate at a higher [ MCR ] compared to the rest of our portfolio.\nAn additional month equates to an increase of approximately 100 basis points to our MCR in the first quarter, which is included in our reported results. Excluding the impact of the later timing of the Medicare divestiture, the fundamental Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings in MCR were both favorable to expectations.\nAs previously noted, we anticipated medical cost trends in 2025 to remain elevated. Year-to-date, we have observed elevated trends consistent with our expectations in most categories. with some favorability in surgical activity and OB services.\nAnd finally, our Stop Loss performance is tracking in line with expectations, and we continue to assume an elevated full year MCR for this business, consistent with our commentary on the fourth quarter earnings call. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered strong results in a dynamic operating environment.\nBefore I comment on our 2025 outlook, as Ralph mentioned, in the first quarter, we initiated a strategic optimization program to further advance the company's ongoing efficiency initiatives. These actions will continue to leverage our scale, technology and innovation to position us for sustainable long-term growth.\nNow turning to our outlook for the full year 2025. We are increasing our full year 2025 expectation for consolidated adjusted income from operations to at least $29.60 per share. This increase is primarily attributed to the incremental earnings contribution from our Medicare businesses, largely reflecting later timing of the divestiture.\nRegarding the cadence of earnings, we expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be slightly below 25% of the full year outlook.\nNow turning to our 2025 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2025 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $7.2 billion, and we expect Evernorth's second quarter pretax adjusted earnings seasonality to be similar to 2024.\nFor Cigna Healthcare, we are increasing our full year 2025 pretax adjusted earnings outlook by $25 million to at least $4.125 billion. We expect the second quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly above 25% of the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year medical care ratio within the range of 83.2% to 84.2%. Additionally, we expect our second quarter medical care ratio to be towards the low end of the full year range.\nTurning to our 2025 capital management position. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 43.1% as of March 31. We expect this ratio to be lower at year-end as we balance our capital management strategy, including debt pay down as we move through the year.\nAs of May 1, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.6 billion. And we remain confident in our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation and we will continue our disciplined capital management approach to drive sustainable long-term growth.\nNow to recap. Our first quarter 2025 results reflect strong contributions and disciplined execution from both Evernorth and Cigna HealthCare. Our 2025 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and solid fundamentals of our growth platforms, which gives us confidence to increase our full year 2025 adjusted earnings outlook to at least $29.6 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com.\nWe use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2025 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nRegarding our results in the fourth quarter, we recorded net after-tax special item charges of $64 million or $0.23 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2025 outlook, will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2025 dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'll discuss key headlines from the quarter and our full year 2024 performance. I'll also share more on the actions we are accelerating to build a better and more sustainable health care model. And then Brian will provide additional details on our financial results and our 2025 outlook, and we'll take your questions.\nBefore I get into our earnings, I want to start by sharing a few comments on the current environment. During my tenure as a leader of the Cigna Group, there have been a number of periods in our industry where we faced unique challenges, whether the financial crisis, the introduction of the ACA to global pandemic or several significant shifts in political, regulatory and societal landscape.\nAt the Cigna Group, our resilience and the durability of our business model have allowed us not only to overcome obstacles, but to lead through change while focusing on achieving our long-term objectives for sustainable growth. In early December, we were all witnessed the tragic murder of Brian Thompson, a leader at the UnitedHealth Group. The past several weeks have further challenged us to even more intensely listed to the public narrative about our industry. At the Cigna Group, we are further accelerating improvements in innovations to increase transparency, expand support and drive even greater accountability. I'll come back to this important topic in a few moments.\nWith that, let me start with a summary of our 2024 results. We delivered full year revenue growth of 27% to approximately $247 billion. Full year adjusted earnings per share of $27.33 representing an increase of 9% year-over-year, but short of our expectations. We returned $8.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. And our Board of Directors declared an 8% increase to our quarterly dividend to $1.51 per share and increased our share repurchase authority to $10.3 billion.\nThe Cigna Group also maintained a strong capital position in 2024. We're also nearly complete with the sale of our Cigna Healthcare Medicare business to HES, and we continue to expect to close in the first quarter and plan to use the majority of the proceeds for share repurchase.\nNow turning to our business results and actions, I want to cover just a few headlines. First, our fourth quarter results were below expectations due to higher-than-expected medical costs in our stop-loss product within Cigna Healthcare. We are taking corrective actions on this near-term pressure and expect to recapture margin over the next 2 years. This is a specific issue we identified and are mitigating and I'll reinforce that we believe our U.S. employer and Cigna Healthcare businesses are strong and remain well positioned, and we're confident in our long-term growth strategy. Brian will discuss this in greater detail in his remarks.\nThe second headline for the quarter is that Evernorth continues to drive strong results in line with our expectations, primarily driven by our Specialty and Care Services segment. Our continued leadership with biosimilars is a good example of how we are addressing some of the biggest challenges facing clients and patients today. We began dispensing our HUMIRA interchangeable biosimilar last summer to eligible Accredo patients with $0 cost to our patients. We are pleased that biosimilar use for eligible HUMIRA scripts reached nearly 50% by year-end 2024.\nWe took another step forward as we announced that we will be an offering an interchangeable STELARA biosimilar, again, for a $0 cost to our patients. Looking forward, we expect approximately $100 billion of specialty spend in the U.S. will be subject to biosimilar and generic competition over the next 5 years. Our HUMIRA and STELARA biosimilar offerings are just the start of this opportunity, and Accredo is well positioned to lead and continue to deliver real savings for our clients, customers and patients.\nNow stepping back, prescription drug coverage is the most frequently used health care benefit. On average, it's used about 15x per year per person. And how our nation and industry captures the full promise of prescription drug innovation while addressing affordability has been subject to continued debate. Pharmacy benefit managers are essential in helping patients access medications at fair and affordable prices. In fact, approximately 80% of Express Scripts patients spend less than $100 out of pocket per year for the prescriptions. Yet, we recognize for those Express Scripts patients who pay more than $100. For some, it's too high. For example, consider the increased use of GLP-1s in the United States, it is the #1 driver of drug trend across employers of all sizes since 2024.\nDespite these medications being relatively cheap to produce, Americans are paying prices that are multiples higher for GLP-1s compared to other countries, even with full pass-through of rebates. Said otherwise, even including all discounts and rebates, the end result is that the U.S. costs are multiples higher than other OECD countries. This is not acceptable, nor sustainable.\nAs for innovations, led by Evernorth and Express Scripts, we are proud that last year our EnCircleRx solution grew to approximately 8 million lives enrolled. where we are supporting the best possible patient outcomes by providing those on GLP-1s additional lifestyle support and tools to help sustain long-term improvement.\nNow the next headline I want to touch on a bit more is the current environment. We have long been on a path to evolve and drive continuous improvement. As we step into 2025, we have further strengthened our urgency and resolve on this path. That means we are accelerating investments that will positively impact the way our customers and patients experience health care. To that end, this week, we announced actions we were taking in Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefit service business within Evernorth. Our commitment will help patients directly benefit further from the negotiations we drive to lower out-of-pocket costs as well as work to further enhance transparency.\nLet me briefly recap the announcements. Going forward, our standard products will provide patients lower prices at the pharmacy counter, protecting them from paying full list prices for drugs, and they will fully benefit from our lower net negotiated prices. Next, patients will also have improved predictability, especially and importantly, in their deductible phase by receiving the benefit of Express Scripts negotiated savings like their employer does. We will also expand the benefit summaries and disclosures we provide. Patients will receive a personalized summary that details their annual total prescription drug costs, planned paid amounts and the savings we deliver. And planned sponsors will also receive an enhanced report beyond what Express Scripts already provides, including additional transparency on costs and pharmacy claim level insights.\nWe know that more can be done within our health plan offering as well for customers and patients as well as clinical partners to further ease access to care, timeliness and expand support programs. More specifically, Cigna Healthcare will soon be announcing steps to improve value and address patient [indiscernible] friction. Our focus is on making higher authorizations faster and simpler and expanding access to advocates for those facing complex health conditions to help them navigate every stage of their care journey.\nThese initiatives will require that we incur additional costs, but we firmly believe these are critical actions for the benefit of customers and patients. We will continue to take a prudent approach to these and future Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth actions in the weeks and months ahead as we are determined to continue to evolve for the benefit of those we serve, and build a more sustainable health care model.\nNow let me briefly summarize. Against the backdrop of a dynamic and challenging environment in 2024, we delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $27.33. And we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Looking ahead to 2025, our EPS outlook of at least $29.50 reinforces the sustained growth and strength of our company, and we are focused on taking the prudent steps necessary to ensure our company is well positioned for future growth. And we remain confident in our long-term 10% to 14% growth target fueled by our differentiated capabilities and portfolio of businesses.\nFinally, we recognize the need for accelerated positive change in our health care system to make it simpler and more affordable for everyone. And the Cigna Group is committed to continuing to take actions to drive further accountability and transparency as well.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2025. For full year 2024, we reported consolidated adjusted revenues of $247.1 billion, adjusted after-tax earnings of $7.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $27.33. Our performance within the Evernorth Health Services segment ended the year strong with particular momentum in Specialty and Care Services. Despite this, our enterprise earnings results fell short of our expectations, driven by higher-than-expected medical costs in our stop-loss products within the Cigna Healthcare segment.\nThis resulted in a full year medical care ratio of 83.2%, which was above our guidance range. We are taking corrective action to recapture margin, and we remain confident in the long-term strength of our business despite the short-term pressure. Now more specific to Cigna Healthcare's fourth quarter results, fourth quarter 2024 revenues were $13.3 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $511 million, and the medical care ratio was 87.9%. As I noted, fourth quarter earnings fell below our expectations as we observed elevated medical costs in stop loss. Results of our other products were in line with expectations, exhibiting a continuation of elevated trends that we had seen throughout the year.\nTaking a step back, it's important to note that Stop Loss is a unique product within our portfolio where employers limit their risk from unexpected high-cost claims by transferring that risk for medical costs above a specific individual or aggregate employer dollar amount. We can see variability in this product at times, but we've generated and continue to expect attractive margins over the long term. This year, variability was more pronounced in the fourth quarter as we had an increase in the number of high-cost claimants related to cost pressures from the continued acceleration in the prescribing and use of specialty medications as well as elevated high acuity surgical activity.\nThe fourth quarter also tends to be when more client settlements transpire, including true-ups for the full calendar year of activity. We had seen some of these trends emerge in the third quarter and began pricing for higher trend on high dollar claims. But did not capture the full extent of this trend acceleration that materialized in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we expect a slightly higher MCR for stop loss in 2025. While this negatively impacts near-term margin, we expect to recapture approximately 100 basis points of margin in the overall Cigna Healthcare segment over the next 2 years with the majority in 2026 and the remaining in 2027.\nWe will do this by balancing pricing action, affordability initiatives, operating cost efficiency and continued investments.\nNow turning to Evernorth. 2024 highlighted another year of sustained growth, particularly within the Specialty & Care segment, highlighting the attractiveness of our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions that create affordability for customers and patients, amidst the growing trend of pharmacological innovation. Adjusted revenues for fourth quarter 2024 grew 33% to $53.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings grew 14% to $2.1 billion, in line with expectations.\nMoving to our businesses within Evernorth, Specialty & Care services adjusted revenue grew 18% to $23.5 billion and adjusted earnings grew 27% to $948 million. This continues the pattern observed from last quarter, which reflects growth across our specialty businesses driven by higher utilization of specialty medications as well as a continued increase in the adoption of HUMIRA biosimilars. By the end of the fourth quarter, we saw almost half of eligible HUMIRA Scripts transition to biosimilars. Pharmacy Benefit Services also posted robust growth, reflecting client wins and the continued demand for new drugs through our innovative products and solutions. Pretax adjusted earnings increased to $1.2 billion as our differentiated capabilities continue to drive affordability and value to our patients, customers and clients.\nOverall, the fourth quarter capped another strong year for Evernorth, with full year pretax adjusted earnings growing 9% for the year. We are the industry leader in pharmacy benefit services and in specialty pharmacy. And our strong 2024 performance gives us confidence for sustained attractive growth over the long term.\nNow turning to our 2025 outlook. First, I'd note that the divestiture of our Medicare businesses to HCSC remains on track to close in the first quarter, and this is contemplated in our outlook. We expect full year 2025 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $252 billion. And we expect full year 2025 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.9 billion or at least $29.50 per share. As David mentioned, we are accelerating investments that will positively impact the way our customers and patients experience health care. Our outlook reflects up to $150 million in costs for these initiatives split between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nWhen considering earnings seasonality, 2024 is not representative of typical patterns given the dynamics I referenced with our stop-loss products. As such, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern for 2025 to be more similar to 2023's pattern. Now turning to our 2025 outlook for each of our segments. In Evernorth, we expect full year 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $7.2 billion. This represents year-over-year growth within our long-term growth target range on a normalized basis.\nWithin Evernorth, we expect first quarter earnings to contribute slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth earnings. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $4.1 billion. This represents mid-single-digit year-over-year growth on a normalized basis. Within Cigna Healthcare, we expect approximately 55% of full year earnings to be in the first half of the year, slightly more weighted to the first quarter. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2025 include our medical care ratio to be in the range of 83.2% to 84.2%. This reflects the expectation that our stop-loss MCR continues to be above target levels for full year 2025.\nWe expect the first quarter 2025 medical care ratio to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. We expect approximately 18.1 million total medical customers at year-end, reflecting the divestiture of our Medicare businesses to HCSC, a reduction in individual exchange customers and growth within our U.S. Employer Select and Middle Market segments.\nFor the enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 5.4% for 2025. This percentage is lower in 2025, largely reflecting mix due to the absence of our Medicare businesses, which carried a higher SG&A ratio compared to the consolidated average. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now moving to our 2024 capital management position and 2025 capital outlook. Our fourth quarter cash flow is quite strong, and we finished full year by delivering $10.4 billion of cash flow from operations.\nIn 2024, we repurchased 20.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $7 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors recently approved an increase of $6 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization, bringing the company's total share repurchase authorization to $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nFinally, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends in 2024. Now framing our 2025 capital outlook. We expect to deliver approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations with the strength of our efficient service-based model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures, and we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.51 per share, an 8% increase on a per share basis.\nOur guidance assumes full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 266 million to 270 million shares. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent with our long-term framework. We expect some debt paydown in 2025 as we look to bring our leverage ratio closer to our 40% target. As it relates to the sale of our Medicare business, we continue to expect a majority of proceeds will go towards share repurchase.\nNow to close, as we look to 2025 and beyond, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our differentiated portfolio of businesses. As David mentioned, we're operating in a highly dynamic environment. But as we've demonstrated in the past, we have a proven track record of meeting challenges and taking the actions to deliver affordable and innovative solutions for our customers and patients. We're confident in our ability to deliver full year 2025 adjusted earnings of at least $29.50 per share, which we believe is prudent at this time, given the dynamic environment.\nWith that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services.\nIn our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com.

Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that we will make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. For the second quarter, we again delivered strong performance as we continue to build on our momentum. Today, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter and key strategic drivers of our growth, demonstrate how the strength and durable nature of our model is fueling our success. Then Brian will review additional details on our results and our outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll move to your questions. So let's get started.\nFor the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that the Cigna Group delivered total revenue of $60.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72. We achieved these positive overall results in a dynamic environment, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to focus on those we serve, ensuring that they get care of the need, to get their medications at an affordable cost and they get the support they need in order to make the best decisions about their health and vitality.\nAll of this requires a relentless focus on innovation, disciplined execution and a passionate commitment to our mission. During the quarter, our Evernorth Health Service businesses demonstrated continued strength with our market-leading specialty and pharmacy benefit services capabilities. Within Evernorth, I'll start with our accelerated growth specialty and care businesses, which provides specialty drugs for the treatment of complex and rare diseases, distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals as well as clinical programs to help clients improve health and vitality.\nWe saw strong growth in the quarter with adjusted income growing 12% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand for our services while we also continue to invest in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. In Accredo, our specialty business, our growth continues to be fueled by secular tailwinds as well as Accredo's differentiated strength which makes us the market leader in the space. Biosimilars, for example, represent a force of change and a substantial opportunity for continued growth and impact.\nAt the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for HUMIRA. Our program has zero out-of-pocket cost for patients, saving them, on average, $3,500 per year. To deliver these savings, we have agreements in place with multiple manufacturers that will produce biosimilars for Evernorth pharmaceutical distributor, Quallent Pharmaceuticals.\nNow the biosimilar opportunity goes well beyond HUMIRA. By 2030, we expect an additional $100 million of annual specialty drug spend in the U.S. will be subject to biosimilar and generic competition. And Accredo is well positioned to deliver differentiated value for our clients, customers and patients. In our care services businesses, we are continuing to grow and expand in key areas of increased demand, including behavioral health, virtual and home care.\nFor example, the summer, we further expanded Evernorth behavioral care group to an additional 7 states. We are seeing positive patient outcomes from our unique clinician matching capabilities based on individual needs and preferences with fully 84% of patients experiencing clinically significant reductions in the depression and anxiety symptoms.\nNow shifting to Express Scripts, our foundational pharmacy benefit services businesses. We are seeing continued strong client demand given our breadth of clinical and supply chain expertise as well as our proven partnership orientation. This quarter, Express Scripts built on a long track record of innovating for those we serve with continued enhancements and new solutions. For example, given the high cost of GLP-1 drugs, we're continuing to see meaningful interest from our clients in EnCircleRx, now with more than 2 million lives already enrolled.\nOur program starts with our longitudinal data to target patients who will most benefit from these medications and we provide patients with resources to make lasting changes to help maximize the effectiveness of these medications, both in the short and long term. Another example of our innovation orientation is a recent announcement of Express Scripts oncology benefit services, which will be available in 2025.\nOur new solution helps patients navigate the challenges of cancer care by providing a single oncology benefit, integrating pharmacy, medical and behavioral health treatments. Our patient-centered approach will help to ensure the earliest possible detection guide individuals to high-quality providers and coordinate care across clinical teams.\nNow moving to Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we continue to deliver solutions that create value and better outcomes for clients and customers, coupled with highly competitive total cost of care. Similar to others in the industry and as we've anticipated, we are seeing increased utilization in our book of business. I would note that our results are largely in line with the elevated levels in our planning and pricing assumptions.\nOur U.S. Employer foundational growth business continues to perform in line with our expectations. Over this year, I've met with hundreds of clients across the U.S. and globally. And while the needs of every client are unique, there are a few consistent themes across every discussion.\nFirst, continued focus on affordability, particularly in light medications like GLP-1 and gene therapies coming to market. Next, an increased need of improved access and importantly, coordination of behavioral health services. Third is mounting point solution fatigue. And fourth, the opportunity and need for leverage of our longitudinal data and clinical programs to help keep people healthy and vital.\nOur solutions continue to resonate well given our highly consultative approach to help clients choose the right set of solutions, our proven capabilities to support their workforce and our innovative programs that help to keep costs down. As a result, we are further gaining share and continue to see outsized opportunities, for example, in our Select segment. Another capability of our U.S. employer business to deliver integrated and tailored benefits for our clients and customers, our modular solutions that incorporate innovative services from Evernorth, including behavioral health, virtual care and pharmacy.\nOur Pathwell solution, which continues to drive exceptional value is a prime example. Pathwell specialty is another way we are reducing costs associated with specialty drug therapies while also providing improved care and clinical outcomes for patients. With our Accredo nurses, nearly 50% of our Pathwell specialty patients who've transitioned their site of care, now receive treatment in the comfort and convenience of their home. We are pleased with how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through solutions like Pathwell.\nTurning to our Medicare Advantage business. We continue to make great progress regarding the sale of this business, and I'm pleased that we remain on track to close in the first quarter of 2025 as planned. Next, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the current environment surrounding pharmacy benefit managers and the relative landscape. At the heart of this debate is the cost of pharmaceuticals. As we previously discussed, a key force of change in health care is the surge of pharmacological innovation.\nFor context, prescription drug coverage is the most frequently used care benefit. And on average, it used 15x per year per person resulting in billions of dollars -- billions of prescriptions per year annually in the United States. Today, and for the foreseeable future, and most meaningful advances extending and improving quality of life will come through gene therapies, breakthrough and treatments for cancers and other conditions as well as personalized medicines.\nIn the U.S., for example, there are already more than 20 gene therapy and cell therapies available. However, there are nearly 1,000 more in the pipeline. Additionally, as we know, GLP-1s are growing rapidly, helping to treat diseases and complications that stem from obesity and diabetes. This class of drug is on tap to be the #1 pharmacy benefit trend driver for plans of all sizes this year. And the impact will grow with some forecasting nearly 10% of the U.S. population using GLP-1s in the next 10 years or sooner.\nThe applications rippling from these fast-growing pharmaceutical trends across the entire health care system are undeniable. And one of the biggest unanswered questions is how could society afford this continued trajectory? Our role is to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as pharmacies to ensure that individuals are able to access pharmacological innovations at a fair and affordable price.\nIn fact, pharmacy benefit companies are the only part of the drug supply chain who work to drive cost down. To underscore this, new drugs coming to market with unsustainable prices in 2023, were up $300,000 on a median basis, up over 35% over 2022. And last year, median brand drug price increases were greater than 5% more than the rate of inflation. Let me repeat this. Last year, the median annual price for new drugs coming to market was $300,000 up 35% over 2022.\nMeanwhile, in 2023, Express Scripts change in pace and cost sharing was relatively flat on average. Express Scripts patients with employer-sponsored drug coverage pay, on average, $15 out of pocket for a 30-day supply. And for clients, Express Scripts delivered more than $38 billion in savings annually. Stepping back, our industry negotiations to drive these results can at times generate friction in the system. Friction that is spilled into and now has reached tightened levels in the political arena and media with industry winners and losers being declared at every report and every headline.\nWe believe that the facts and results and outcomes delivered to our clients, customers and patients will rule the day. However, the environment calls on us to be more proactive. This means ensuring that what we do and the value we bring is more widely and better understood. And we continue to evolve our model to address legitimate pain points and opportunities. For example, in 2023, 1% of the patients in the United States experienced out-of-pocket costs above $2,000 a year. From our point of view, that's too many. We accept the responsibility to accelerate innovation to make medications more affordable while continuing to improve health outcomes in finding solutions for every person we serve.\nMake no doubt our team will continue to lean into the challenge for the benefit of our patients, clients and the health care ecosystem and we are proud of the work that our team does every day and the role we play and the results we're able to achieve.\nNow let me pause and summarize before transitioning to Brian. When you combine our compelling growth potential and strong execution focus, we have confidence in our ability to meet our 2024 and long-term growth targets. We have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value for those we serve by innovating new solutions like in EnCircleRx and our Pathwell suite as well as expanding meaningful partnerships. As a result, in the second quarter, we delivered on our financial commitment with adjusted EPS of $6.72, and we remain on track to deliver our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40 for 2024. Further, our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities over the long term, and we remain on track to deliver average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14% and building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS growth over the last decade, all while we generate cumulative operating cash flow of $60 billion over the next 5 years while continuing to meaningfully invest capital for the benefit of shareholders.\nWe also continue to make strategic investments in strengthening our capabilities in our foundational and accelerated growth business. and remain focusing on harnessing the breadth of our capabilities of our organization to meet the evolving needs of those we serve. Overall, our strong performance through the first half of the year reflects the balance in our company portfolio and the significant value creation that positions us for sustained and differentiated growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, reflecting growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare care. The results underpin the strength and the stability of our diversified portfolio of businesses in a dynamic environment and demonstrate continued execution against our operating and financial commitments.\nKey consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter include revenue of $60.5 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72 or 10% year-over-year growth. With the strong first half performance, we continue to have confidence in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, which represents more than 13% year-over-year growth in EPS.\nNow turning to our segment results. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by both of its operating segments. Second quarter 2024 revenues grew to $49.5 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew 7% to $1.6 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. Specialty and Care Services showed strong growth with revenue up 18% to $22.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were up 12% to $756 million, at the high end of our long-term target growth range. This performance is a demonstration of our robust and diversified capabilities as we delivered broad-based growth across our specialty businesses,\nAccredo and CuraScript, as well as in our care services businesses. Pharmacy Benefit Services also posted strong revenue growth driven by the addition of new business wins and expansion of existing relationships. Pretax adjusted earnings increased to $798 million as our innovative capabilities continue to drive value for our clients, customers and patients. Overall, we're pleased with Evernorth's second quarter results and continue to expect strong income growth in the second half of the year.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2024 revenues were $13.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion. Second quarter earnings were in line with expectations and included approximately $50 million of a favorable prior year impact related to Medicare Advantage risk adjustment. The second quarter medical care ratio of 82.3% was within our expected range, inclusive of the aforementioned unfavorable prior year impact of approximately $50 million or 40 basis points on the medical care ratio. Absent this item, the underlying medical care ratio was broadly in line with expectations. As noted previously, we had planned and priced for 2024 medical cost trend to be above 2023 levels, which took into account both unit cost inflation as well as continued elevated utilization.\nYear-to-date, we have seen elevated cost trends, consistent with our planning and pricing assumptions. The net medical cost payable at the end of the second quarter was $5.04 billion, compared to $5.66 billion at the end of the first quarter. As noted previously, in the first quarter, we had booked approximately $650 million in incremental reserves relating to the Change Healthcare disruption. Those reserves have since developed in line with expectations and claims payments have returned to more normalized levels. driving the sequential decline in net medical cost payable.\nMoving to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with $19 million total medical customers. We expect growth in Cigna Healthcare medical customers for the remainder of the year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. employer Select and Middle Market segments. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered consistent results in a dynamic operating environment.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2024. With our continued strong underlying performance in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $8.065 billion or at least $28.40 per share. Regarding cadence of earnings, we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook.\nNow turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects continued momentum into the second half, with third quarter Evernorth earnings expected to accelerate to high single-digit year-over-year growth, in part due to an increase in adoption of our interchangeable biosimilar offering.\nFor Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year medical care ratio within the range of 81.7% to 82.5%. With the first half medical care ratio coming in at 81.1%, the midpoint of our guidance implies an 83.1% medical care ratio for the second half of the year. We would expect the third quarter to be slightly below that level.\nTurning to our 2024 capital management position. As of July 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares of common stock or approximately $5 billion, consistent with our previous commentary. We continue to expect at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives attractive returns on capital.\nNow to recap. Our first half 2024 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2024 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our two growth platforms, which gives us confidence to deliver on our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40.\nWith that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.\nWe'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of The Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our first quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income or loss and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nBefore turning the call over, I will cover a few items pertaining to our GAAP financial results. In the first quarter, we recorded shareholders net loss of $277 million or $0.97 per share. This is driven by noncash after-tax net realized investment loss of $1.8 billion or $6.31 per share, primarily related to a VillageMD impairment charge. This is excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share in our discussion of financial results. We also recorded an after-tax net special item charge of $3 million or $0.01 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. As described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. In the first quarter, our company continued delivering differentiated value for our clients, customers, patients and partners. And we posted strong results for the quarter as we continue to build on our momentum coming into 2024. Today, I'll discuss our quarterly performance and key strategic drivers of our growth. Specifically, I'll spend a few minutes talking about our specialty business and our focus on biosimilars to drive greater affordability in the market for the benefit of those we serve. Then Brian will review additional details about our financial results during the quarter, our increased outlook for full year 2024 [ and ] from capital position, and then we'll take your questions. So let's get started.\nIn the quarter, I'm pleased to report that The Cigna Group delivered total revenue of $57.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.47. And given our momentum and strong start to the year, we have increased our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to at least $28.40. These positive results demonstrate our differentiated capabilities innovative approaches and disciplined execution during a dynamic and disruptive time for our industry. Our results also speak to our diverse and well-balanced portfolio. as we invest in our high-growth businesses, which continue to benefit from secular tailwinds and ensure our foundational businesses are positioned for continued success.\nIn Evernorth Health Services, we're pleased with our results that are in line with our expectations. Starting with our pharmacy benefit services, our foundational businesses, our innovative solutions continue to gain traction with health plans, large commercial employers and government organizations. A recent example of how we continue to drive greater access and affordability in a rapidly evolving pharmaceutical landscape is EnCircleRx. This solution focuses on cardiodiabesity adds value for our clients and patients by providing predictability, reducing cost and enhancing outcomes related to GLP-1 drug coverage. We're pleased with the strong interest in EnCircleRx from our clients with more than 1 million lives already enrolled. EnCircleRx is made possible given our decade-plus track record of offering new solutions built on data-driven insights and our deep supply chain expertise said otherwise, we have a proven innovation platform.\nIn our Accelerated Growth Specialty Care and Services businesses, our results were in line with our expectations, reflecting strong double-digit adjusted revenue growth. As a reminder, this set of businesses is diverse and includes Accredo, CuraScript Specialty Distribution and our emerging care service businesses. I'll talk more about specialty in a few moments. In Care Services, we are investing in a number of areas, including accountable care, virtual home base, and behavioral care. We're pleased with the progress our Evernorth behavioral Care Group is making since its launch in 6 states plus the District of Columbia, and we have already expanded access and convenience for patients with our program.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of strong performance. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we are pleased with our strong medical cost performance and medical care ratio which was 79.9%. Our U.S. employer business is outpaced for another good year as we continue to leverage our high-performing networks and digitally enabled services to expand access and overall value. At our Investor Day, we discussed the strong results we've seen with our patrol suite of solutions, including Pathwell Specialty which drives value by reducing costs associated with specialty drugs and therapies and improving care experiences and outcomes for patients. Also within the Pathwell suite is our Pathwell bone and joint solution which we piloted in 2023 and is now being rolled out for broader client adoption. For context, 1 in 2 adults suffer from a musculoskeletal condition, which results in more than $500 billion of annual spend. Our solution uses a curated national network, combined with clinical and digital services to guide patients with spine knee, hip and shoulder conditions to the right pathway of care at the right time. We're already seeing strong results, and our personalized [ costier ] experience has resulted in 96% patient satisfaction while also delivering meaningful savings for our clients from this innovative program. Turning to international health.\nOur results continue to be strong given our focus on localized health solutions and high-quality services for the globally mobile population. In our individual exchange business, we continue to sharpen our focus by repositioning our book through targeted actions in certain geographies. It's also important to note, we are making good progress toward our sale of our Medicare businesses to HCSC. The sale of these businesses to HCSC remains on track with the expiration of the waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which occurred on April 17. As such, the regulatory review of this transaction by the DOJ is complete. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 as planned. After closing, we will continue to serve Medicare Advantage customers through our Evernorth broad suite of high-performing services. and under our agreement with HCSC, these include services for the seniors who will transition with the domestic businesses. Taken together, we're pleased with our results for the first quarter. They reflect the quality and strength of our businesses and position us well for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation.\nNow I want to spend a few minutes on our specialty businesses within Evernorth, which is already a large and well-established portfolio of services, yet represents accelerated growth opportunity as we look forward. Overall, the specialty market is large at about $400 billion today and is fast growing. And Evernorth is the industry leader. Our performance continues to be strong with double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter. Our combination Accredo, CuraScript Specialty Distribution and Care Path offer something truly unique in the market, built over decades with assets and capabilities that are highly differentiated. And while we are the leader in the industry, we continue to innovate our capabilities and offerings and expand our reach and impact. For example, just last week, Evernorth announced that we will have an interchangeable HUMIRA biosimilar available for a $0 out-of-pocket cost for eligible Accredo patients.\nCurrently, more than 100,000 Accredo patients use either HUMIRA or one of the biosimilars. They are supported by specialty trained pharmacists and nurses in Accredo's Therapeutic Resource Center for inflammatory conditions who are available to serve and support these patients around the clock, meet the individual needs of our patients while driving significant savings for them and their health plans, we will be able to provide both high and low concentration interchangeable biosimilars, or put another way, varying dosage levels based on patient needs. To accomplish this, we have agreements in place with multiple manufacturers who will produce biosimilars for Evernorth's private label pharmaceutical distributor, [indiscernible] Pharmaceuticals, which we launched back in 2021. The biosimilars will be priced at about 85% lower than HUMIRA and we estimate that individual patients will save on average of $3,500 per year.\nAnd in addition to Accredo patients, all of our pharmacy benefit service clients and patients will have access to these biosimilars. Importantly, the biosimilar opportunity goes well beyond HUMIRA. By 2030, we expect to see biosimilars or generics introduced for nearly half of the top 25 specialty drugs in the United States. This translates to over $100 billion in annual spend, subject to additional choice and competition. The introduction of biosimilars creates a multiyear tailwind that enables us to continue to drive growth and value creation for the benefit of those we serve. Clearly, we're very excited about the growth opportunities we see ahead in specialty. Our specialty businesses are a cornerstone of the accelerated growth within Evernorth and our confidence in our leading position and capabilities will continue to fuel innovation, such as the biosimilar launch I just discussed.\nNow to wrap up, let me recap our performance for the quarter. In the quarter, we continued to execute well and perform well. We met the evolving needs of our clients, customers, patients and partners in the midst of a dynamic marketplace. We delivered on our financial commitments, including adjusted EPS of $6.47 and we've increased our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to at least $28.40. This performance puts us toward the higher end of our 10% to 14% long-term average annual EPS growth commitment. Looking ahead, we will focus on meeting our commitments as we execute our strategy. by creating value for the benefit of those we serve by driving greater affordability and access expansion and delivering innovations that continue to grow market share over time in Evernorth and in Cigna Healthcare.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year with first quarter pretax adjusted earnings above expectations, reflecting [ contractions ] across our 2 growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Key consolidated financial highlights for the first quarter include revenue of $57.3 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.47 or 20% year-over-year growth and cash flow from operations of $4.8 billion. The continued momentum and strong fundamentals of our businesses give us the confidence to increase our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $28.40. Before I turn to our segment results, I'd like to briefly discuss the impact of the changed health care disruption in the first quarter. We experienced incremental operating expenses that are reflected in our first quarter results. And within Cigna Healthcare, we had some disruption to claim submissions and payments that I'll discuss further in a few moments. Despite these unexpected events, we delivered a very strong start to the year and are proud of our teams managing through a dynamic operating environment. Now turning to our segment results.\nFirst, I'll comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2024 Evernorth revenues were $46.2 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion, in line with expectations. As discussed at our Investor Day in March, starting this quarter, we're providing revenue and pretax adjusted earnings for our 2 operating segments within Evernorth, namely pharmacy benefit services and specialty and care services. For the quarter, Pharmacy Benefit Services revenue increased 43%, driven by new business wins, including Centene starting on January 1. Pretax adjusted earnings were $513 million, reflecting growth offset by the net impact of client onboarding and implementation costs. Specialty & Care services revenue increased 12%. And pretax adjusted earnings grew to $788 million, in line with expectations. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform well, and we're pleased with the results to start the year. Turning to Cigna Healthcare.\nFirst quarter 2024 adjusted revenues were $13.3 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion. Cigna Healthcare first quarter results were better than expectations, driven by a favorable medical care ratio, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and lower net investment income. The first quarter medical care ratio of 79.9% benefited from our focus on affordability initiatives and effective pricing execution as we planned and price for the continuation of elevated cost trend levels the industry experienced in 2023. As noted earlier, the [ Change ] health care incident caused some disruption to first quarter operations, including claims processing and submissions. Within the quarter, we booked approximately $650 million in incremental reserves in Cigna Healthcare relating to this disruption. Approximately 2/3 of the incremental reserve pertains to claims that we received but were not paid out as of March 31. The claims have since been paid out to providers. The balance of the incremental reserve represents an estimate of first quarter claims incurred but not yet reported, specifically pertaining to the [ Change ] health care disruption. We remain confident in our reserve posture and cost trend projections over the balance of the year. Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers.\nWe ended the quarter with 19.2 million total medical customers. This is in line with our expectations and includes a reduction to our individual exchange enrollment following the repositioning of our book in certain geographies to improve overall profitability. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered strong results in the quarter. Our Cigna Healthcare results continue to benefit from our decade-plus track record of value-based care. We have continued to further evolve this strategy with Evernorth Accountable Care and remain committed to driving affordability and quality outcomes for our clients and patients through our partnership-oriented value-based care framework. As Ralph mentioned in his opening comments, during the quarter, we recognized a noncash impairment charge related to VillageMD, which is excluded from our adjusted earnings. This accounting item does not alter our forward-looking value-based care strategy. where we continue to make progress in aligning incentives with providers, including with VillageMD. Our partnership has already launched and targeted geographic markets, and we will seek to build upon that early progress. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024.\nWe continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Health Care. We now expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.065 billion or at least $28.40 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. We expect the 2024 adjusted earnings per share cadence to be approximately 45% in the first half and the remaining 55% in the second half. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms.\nIn Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect Evernorth's second quarter pretax adjusted earnings to grow mid-single digits year-over-year. For Cigna Healthcare, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion, an increase from our prior guidance to reflect the strength of our first quarter results and continued confidence for the rest of the year. We expect Cigna Healthcare pretax earnings in the second quarter to be approximately 25% of full year pretax adjusted earnings. We also now expect our full year 2024 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.5%, an improvement of 20 basis points from the high end of the prior range. Additionally, we expect our second quarter medical care ratio to be within our full year guidance range. Turning to our 2024 capital management position.\nOur debt-to-capitalization ration was 44.3% as of March 31 compared to 40.1% as of December 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects the timing of debt issuance in part due to the accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered in February. We continue to target a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. We continue to expect at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations and we continue to expect to use the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase this year. Additionally, our guidance continues to assume full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 282 million to 286 million shares. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong. driven by the strength of our highly efficient service-based model.\nNow to recap. Our first quarter consolidated results were ahead of expectations, driven by the strength of our medical care ratio within Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our 2 growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to maintain a prudent posture in this dynamic environment. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our updated full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.40 per share.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was a very strong year for our company with consistent performance and sustained growth. We executed with discipline across our businesses. We delivered for our customers and patients, our employer clients, our health plan partners in the others we serve. And with our expertise and diverse breadth of capabilities, we continue to improve affordability and clinical outcomes as well as continuing our work to expand access and choice. As we look forward, we're carrying momentum into 2024 and we expect another strong year of performance in growth.\nNow today, I'll focus my comments on key strategic drivers of our performance last year and how we continue to evolve and advance our business to sustain our impact on growth. Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. Then we'll take your questions.\nNow before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025, following customary legal and regulatory approvals. And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses well large at about $12 billion in revenue, would require sustained investments and focus and capital as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within the Cigna Group's portfolio.\nAdditionally, with Evernorth's broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we're expanding the reach of Evernorth's portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in Government services, including Medicare.\nNow as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations. And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion, and disciplined pricing activity.\nNow with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines. Broadly for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments. Full year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion. This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent positive results in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare, while also shaping and expanding our Evernorth Health Services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace.\nAs a result of our focus, discipline and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis. In the 5 years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year, and we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments.\nIn 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and grow.\nNow I'll discuss our performance in greater detail. I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry. Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication, so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was amongst hundreds of additional clients that were ready to serve in 2024 and our process we're off to a strong start.\nThe good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and of the clients place in our company. Another Evernorth highlight for 2023 is that we once again advanced industry-leading innovation. Last spring, we launched a series of innovations, including ClearCareRx, to support affordability, additional transparency and broader choice as well as independent Rx to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies.\nThen in November, we have further an expanding choice for clients funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts Clear network. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing. In addition, our accelerated growth businesses with Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth's strong top and bottom line results.\nWith Accredo and CuraScript SD, we are supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of the growing volume of high-cost clinically compliant specialty drugs. We also continue building out our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it, while also remaining connected with physical sense of care.\nOur MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting the growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities were valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations and health care providers.\nIn Sidney Healthcare, we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management. We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the health care system. Our leading clinical care programs could use to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality.\nOur ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulting in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. Commercial Employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth. This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care and overall value.\nOur individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024.\nIn international health, we achieved another positive top and bottom line results. Our high-quality and localized health solutions, supported by our global provider network continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations.\nNow turning to 2024. We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear durable strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses. Pharmacy benefit, U.S. commercial employer and our international health business. Our clients depend on our pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise as well as our leadership in lowering cost for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss in diabetes.\nWe have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs such as our EnCircleRx program. We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. Commercial Employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for the Cigna Group.\nWe continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs.\nSecond, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled specialty pharmacy business and our care service businesses. We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities, supporting patients with high cost and clinically complex treatments.\nAnd within Care Services, we're advancing our capabilities in behavioral health, virtual and home care as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions. In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $2025, we expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend.\nNow before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcement we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric. Brian has been our Chief Financial Officer for the past 3 years and will continue in that role. He will also expand his responsibilities as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as Executive Vice President of Enterprise Strategy for the Cigna Group, while also continuing as President and CEO of Evernorth Services. Brian and Eric's expanded positions as well as other leadership changes we announced provide further clarity of our priorities and strategy as well as the extent of reach and impact lucid to have.\nImportantly, it also reinforces the depth of our management bench. At our Investor Day on March 7 in New York City, you'll hear more from me, Brian and Eric, as well as other key leaders from across our company. We look forward to sharing with you our views of the expanded addressable markets we see and how we've positioned the Signet Group to advance our next chapters of attractive growth.\nNow I'll briefly summarize. With the momentum we carried out of 2023, we are raising our guidance for EPS in 2024. We are building on a strong year of disciplined execution, performance and growth across our company. We deliver for our customers and clients and partners. We kept our commitments to our shareholders, including delivering adjusted EPS for 2023 of $25.09, which was above our outlook, and we generated $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations.\nWe have sharpened the focus of our portfolio further to ensure that we are positioned to drive another strong year for our company. We are building on a consistent track record of disciplined execution, innovation and differentiated partnerships. We've increased our outlook for 2024 and now expect EPS of at least $20.25, and we will continue to advance the strategic deployment of capital, including using the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase in 2024.\nWe'll have another strong year of performance, continue our track record for more than a decade of delivering against our 10% to 13% long-term adjusted EPS growth target while maintaining an attractive dividend. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for the Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nLooking at full year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79. These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024.\nRegarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth. As our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer and government, clients and customers.\nFourth quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion and pretax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our specialty pharmacy business, which saw a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full year 2023. And our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new drug innovations come to market, including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions.\nThe fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pretax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full year 2023, reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo specialty pharmacy.\nNow turning to Cigna Healthcare. We outperformed expectations with full year 2023 pretax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio was 82.2%, favorable to expectations.\nOur medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. Commercial Employer business, particularly within our stop-loss products, which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high dollar claimants. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID and RSV running below projections.\nAs David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025, following regulatory approvals. And our full year 2024 outlook assumes full year contributions from our Medicare businesses.\nFor fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives, and the favorability in our Stop Loss products. The full year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance, and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full year 2022.\nMoving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million or 10% from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance. This growth was driven by U.S. health care primarily from U.S. commercial employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage.\nCigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. commercial employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disruptive market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2024, specifically. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Health care. We expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023.\nNow turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. At Evernorth, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth adjusted earnings.\nThe earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end, and we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% and to 82.7%, with the first quarter 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns.\nAdditionally, for the enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%.\nTurning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1% and an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022.\nNow framing our 2024 capital outlook. We expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures, and we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per share basis.\nIn 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase. As we previously shared, we anticipate to repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $282 million to 286 million shares.\nNow to recap. Our full year 2023 consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna HealthCare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our 2 growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Health care. We are confident in our ability to deliver full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. .\nIn our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our third quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nBefore turning over the call, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results. In the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $171 million or $0.58 per share for charges primarily associated with our Medicare litigation settlement.\nWe also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $19 million or $0.06 per share associated with the sale of our international life accidental and supplemental business to Chubb and an after-tax special item charge of $9 million or $0.03 per share for integration and transaction-related costs.\nAs described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We had another quarter of strong performance, and we remain on pace for a year of sustained momentum in 2023.\nWith the strength of capabilities across our health services and benefits platforms, we are continuing to deliver on our mission for those we serve as we continue to grow our company.\nToday, I'll highlight key drivers supporting our performance during the quarter our priorities and opportunities for expanding our impact and continue to advance our growth and our view of 2024, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds.\nBrian will share additional perspective about our third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. So with that, let's get started.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered $49 billion in total revenue, adjusted earnings per share of $6.77, continued strong cash flow generation across our franchise, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation. These results are strong, and they show how we're continuing our track record of strong, sustained performance.\nWith our Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare Benefits platform, we are executing well in a dynamic period and fueling customer growth with our deep clinical expertise, innovative solutions and breadth of market-leading capabilities.\nOur results during the quarter demonstrate how we're continuing to deliver on our commitments for our customers and patients our clients as well as our shareholders. We are raising our full year 2023 outlook for EPS, customer and revenue growth, as well as cash flow from operations.\nWith our continued affordability initiatives, we are also now guiding to an improved medical care ratio for 2023. Our businesses are performing well, and we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of at least $24.75 for full year 2023.\nNow I'll turn to how we are working to sustain our growth and impact. With our durable strategic growth framework, we harness complementary capabilities from across the Cigna Group. We have scale to mature businesses that drive foundational growth, and businesses in faster-growing market segments that contribute accelerated growth.\nWe fuel additional growth through cross enterprise leverage as we bring together the power of our talent, client relationships, differentiated capabilities and innovation from across our company.\nNext, I'll share how we have deliberately shaped our portfolio of businesses that are well positioned for today's market needs. Additionally, I'll highlight some of the ways we continue to drive our sustained success as we look to the future.\nEvernorth Health Services continues to demonstrate a proven ability to create value with differentiated pharmacy care and benefits capabilities. We had a strong pharmacy benefit selling season for 2024, and our teams are already actively engaged in the 2025 season. We are continuing to innovate and provide our clients with expanded choice as well as market-leading value.\nMany of the clients we serve leverage Evernorth's unique suite of solutions to support the needs of their customers. Centene is one new relationship we discussed before, and our teams have been collaborating effectively on implementation work, which is going very well as we prepare to serve approximately 20 million Centene customers beginning in January.\nWe have a leadership position in addressing a substantial market opportunity with the expanded wave of pharmacological innovation that is reshaping the health care landscape. Many of the treatments that are coming to market are pressuring affordability with high list prices from drug manufacturers.\nAt Evernorth, we are driving better experience, clinical outcome and affordability for patients and clients, given our deep clinical expertise, strong relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as with physicians.\nThe surge of demand for the GLP-1 drug class for weight management offers a good example of how we provide value. Our InCircle Rx program is an innovative solution that addresses the complexity and costs associated with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, a prevalent combination of conditions that's also known as cardio diabesity. Growing at Evernorth's clinical expertise, breadth and depth of data and analytical insights, InCircle Rx guides patients to the most effective care and helps improve affordability for clients.\nBeyond the GLP-1 drug class, we expect to see many different manufacturers bringing forth a growing number of new drugs, including gene therapies, additional treatments for cancer as well as others for Alzheimer's and other conditions.\nWe are uniquely well positioned to make medicine more accessible, affordable and clinically coordinated for those we serve as well as to continue to drive growth for our company.\nNow in our international health business, another foundational business within a portfolio. We are supporting continued growth in target markets and expanding our portfolio of solutions. During the quarter, for example, we introduced a new affordable health plan, customized specifically for the globally mobile seniors population.\nAdditionally, in the foundational portfolio, our U.S. commercial business continues to harness cross-enterprise leverage capabilities for the benefit of their clients.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we know that additional -- in addition to affordability, one of the top priorities for many employers is expanding access, coordination and overall effectiveness of behavioral health programs and solutions.\nThe benefit of our commercial clients to customers, we are leveraging innovations and capabilities that exist in our accelerated businesses. For example, stress, anxiety, [indiscernible], other mental health conditions create challenges for employers who need a healthy, engaged workforce, and we continue to expand the behavioral health solutions we offer through Evernorth Care businesses.\nOne of the newer solutions is Confide behavioral health navigator. It's resonating well with clients, helping us both retain and win new business. Confide is guided by a proven model of a more proactive, high-touch service level, effective monitoring and targeted follow-up engagement.\nWe will launch additional enhancements next year to provide digital tools that are personalized to the needs of individual patients that improve matching them with the right therapists and also offer greater convenience and accelerated scheduling opportunities.\nAdditionally, as we continue to advance our focus on vitality, including our latest research addressing the capacity of individuals across multiple dimensions, it reinforces that mental health, for example, is one of the most significant drivers. We know that adults without significant mental health challenges are 10x more likely to have high vitality. Now if you're an employer, this means higher engagement, higher productivity, lower turnover as well as lower medical costs.\nIn addition to addressing growing behavior health needs in Evernorth Care, we are also acting as a positive disruptor in care delivery and care management to improve experience, outcomes and access from a patient's perspective. We're developing innovative care models and clinical programs with continued investments, for example, to expand our digital and virtually-led capabilities, while making sure they are coordinated and connected with physical sites of care. For example, we continue to innovate and build on [ MD Live's ] leading virtual care platform and plan to further accelerate new capabilities in 2024.\nTurning to another accelerated growth business. I'll touch on specialty pharmacy. Last quarter, we talked with you about Accredo's extensive clinical expertise in the assets that provide us with a competitive advantage in this fast-growing specialty pharmacy market, which continues to be an important source of growth for our company.\nWe also have additional capabilities contributing to our leadership and growth opportunities in this space. Accredo focuses predominantly on supporting patients who receive specialty drugs in their home. Sometimes, these complex medications also need to be administered in physician's offices or hospital outpatient settings.\nToday, we support providers and health systems with our CuraScript specialty distribution capability and we continue to see meaningful growth in this aspect of our specialty pharmacy services.\nFinally, an additional accelerated business is our U.S. government portfolio services. We are pleased with our recent Medicare stars quality rating showing that we again have over 2/3 of our members in 4-star or higher plans. This is recognition of the value we provide to seniors in supporting access as well as high-quality care.\nWith open enrollment now underway for both Medicare Advantage and the individual exchange business, we are balancing competitive benefit offerings, targeted market expansion and pricing discipline activity.\nSo to summarize, we are performing well across our diverse enterprise. And these highlights reinforce how our strategic framework guides us in accelerating innovation, expanding client relationships and continuing to broaden our reach.\nNow as we look to 2024, we expect another strong year of performance for the Cigna Group as we build on momentum with EPS, revenue and cash flow growth. We'll share more detailed guidance with you on our fourth quarter earnings call as we always do.\nThe tailwinds and headwinds we expect in the year ahead remain largely consistent with our prior conversation, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 per share in 2024.\nNotable tailwinds include growth-related contributions, including the full launch of Centene, which starts on January 1, a growing positive impact of biosimilar contributions, and an improved margin profile in our individual exchange business.\nIn terms of headwinds, we will continue to make strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation as well as position ourselves for long-term growth.\nNow I'll just briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. We had another strong quarter, and it builds on good momentum throughout the course of the year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.77, as well as strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth.\nOur company continues to deliver for the benefit of those we serve, and we have been able to increase our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, and we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 in 2024, which is consistent with our past discussions.\nWe are well positioned with a clear durable strategic framework that leverages the power of our differentiated services within our benefits portfolio and services portfolio.\nAnd now Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian?\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's third quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year.\nWe are proud to deliver another strong quarterly performance, including all of our most critical metrics running in line or favorable to expectations. With this performance, we are increasing our full year adjusted 2023 earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.\nNow looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 8% to $49 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growth of 8% to $2 billion, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to $6.77, and cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion.\nOur 2 growth platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting a bottom line growth rate that improved sequentially as expected, and Cigna Healthcare delivering results ahead of expectations.\nRegarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, with third quarter 2023 revenues growing 8% to $38.6 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings growing 6% to $1.7 billion in line with expectations.\nEvernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong performance in our Specialty Pharmacy business, which continues to see double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.\nWe continue to provide a variety of differentiated services and solutions that drive affordability and value for our customers and our clients, while also enhancing cross enterprise leverage across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare growth platforms.\nIn addition, we continue to make strategic investments to support onboarding of new clients and expansion of existing client relationships, all while advancing our digital and care solutions capabilities to enhance customer experiences and provide clients with greater options to achieve their critical goals of access, quality outcomes and affordability.\nOverall, Evernorth delivered strong third quarter results, consistent with expectations, and we remain well positioned as we look to the remainder of the year.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Third quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $12.8 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings grew 16% to $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.5%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations, driven by our U.S. commercial business. More specifically, our favorable MCR performance was a reflection of ongoing disciplined pricing and continued affordability initiatives, ensuring patients get quality care in appropriate settings. An example of this is Pathwell Specialty, our site of care program that aligns patients who have high-cost specialty conditions with high quality, yet cost-effective care settings.\nMoving to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.6 million total medical customers, which represents growth of approximately 1.6 million customers year-to-date. On a sequential basis, we delivered medical customer growth across all businesses within Cigna Healthcare, ahead of expectations.\nOverall, Cigna Healthcare continues to provide differentiated value and drive affordability for our customers and clients, and the results in the quarter demonstrate our strong underlying fundamentals.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $192 billion, driven by strong growth across our businesses. And we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.\nIn Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. This implies mid- to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior commentary.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.6 million customers. This updated outlook represents the third consecutive quarter we have increased our customer growth despite the dynamic economic backdrop. We now expect our medical care ratio to be within a range of 81.5% to 82%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the high end of the prior range. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. This outlook reflects our continued focus and execution across our Cigna Healthcare businesses.\nAdditionally, our full year 2023 enterprise adjusted SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.4%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms.\nAnd finally, our full year 2023 adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%.\nTurning to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 1, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.2 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $1 billion to at least $10.5 billion for full year 2023. And our updated guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares outstanding to now be in the range of 296 million to 298 million shares.\nOur healthy balance sheet and cash flow outlook benefit from our efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.\nNow to recap. Third quarter results were strong, reflecting execution across our diverse portfolio of businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.75. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter call, we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.\nThat said, I'd like to expand upon the tailwinds and headwinds David spoke to earlier. Our tailwinds include revenue growth, inclusive of the full launch of our Centene relationship starting January 1, and continued momentum of the biosimilar opportunity to drive more savings to benefit our patients and clients.\nWe also anticipate improvement in our individual exchange margins next year driven by our pricing actions taken in targeted geographies. Given these actions, we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business relative to where we are in 2023.\nThese tailwinds will be partially offset by continued strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation and long-term growth.\nWe look forward to providing detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a strong performance, fueled by continued growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Today, I'll review key strategic drivers contributing to our momentum and while we believe we're well positioned to sustain our growth as we continue to support the health and vitality of those we serve with our differentiated solutions and capabilities. .\nBrian will cover additional details about our financial performance in the quarter and our 2023 outlook. As part of our ongoing effort for you to hear more from members of our leadership team, Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services, will be joining our call and is available to take your questions.\nWith that, let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $48.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. We're pleased with our performance overall during the quarter and through the first half of the year. With focus on affordability and innovation, we are continuing to strengthen our competitive position and grow our businesses.\nIn Evernorth Health Services, we saw another strong quarter of our market-leading pharmacy, care and benefits portfolio. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business harnesses our deep relationships, extensive clinical expertise and is delivering innovations and innovative solutions for those we serve. We've long been a leader in supporting access to prescription drugs and to further enhance our efforts, we took a series of actions in the quarter including launching co-pay assurance to support further affordability for patients and ClearCare Rx to provide our clients with broader choice.\nWe also introduced independent Rx, which is a first of its kind support program for rural pharmacists that recognizes the critical role they play in improving access for millions of Americans. We will continue to lead the way to the current environment of elevated legislative and regulatory activity, and we're encouraged by the positive recognition of our work to make safe, effective and affordable access of prescription drugs within reach for millions of people who need them.\nOur client retention is also strong, and we are continuing to build and expand new relationships. For example, we're making good progress for our implementation with Centene, which begins on January 2024. Our teams are working collaboratively, and we are on track as we prepare to further improve affordability in serving 20 million Centene customers.\nIn the quarter, we had strong growth in Accredo, our specialty pharmacy business. In a moment, I'll profile the deep clinical expertise and capabilities that make [indiscernible] differentiated leader in the space.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. We delivered another quarter of organic customer growth, reinforcing how well our consultative approach and capabilities continue to resonate in the market. Our U.S. commercial business continues to build momentum. We've had sustained success with commercial customer growth outpacing the overall market, and 2023 is shaping up to be another very strong year for this business. With our affordability initiatives and deep consultative sales approach, we're delivering highly competitive total cost of care for employer clients as well as providing programs supporting healthy engaged workforces that they need.\nIn U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market customer growth with high-quality affordable paints and targeted investments that we continue to make to further strengthen our network and offerings.\nIn our individual exchange business, we will continue taking a focused approach by engaging customers to improve health outcomes and managing risks in the expanding population we serve. In the quarter, while our medical care ratio was generally in line with expectations, we did have an increase to our 2023 risk adjustment payable. Relative to the risk adjuster impact, we expect this to be a 2023 event, and we've already taken actions for 2024.\nIn our international health business, we drove continued innovation and growth in target markets with solutions for the [indiscernible] population and employees of multinational corporations as well as into governmental organizations. Overall, our second quarter results show that the Cigna group is performing well with underlying strength in our complementary businesses. We believe we're well positioned to continue growing our company and deliver on our commitments. With the strength of our results, we are increasing our outlook for full year revenue and customer growth as well as cash flow from operations, and we are reaffirming that we are on track to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023.\nNow I'll talk about how we are working to sustain our momentum with our differentiated and diversified capabilities and our durable strategic growth framework. Our framework guides us in continuing to respond to customer, patient and client needs as well as capturing growth opportunities within our foundational businesses and our accelerated growth businesses.\nAdditionally, we harness the power of our talent, client relationships and partnerships as well as an expanding technology portfolio for cross enterprise leverage. Technology increasingly provides us with opportunities to accelerate innovation and growth. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, capabilities further enhancing ways for us to support patients in their clinical care teams as well as drive additional efficiency initiatives.\nToday, I'll talk more about one of our accelerated growth businesses, Accredo, our flagship specialty pharmacy, where we have a competitive advantage in an area of growing need and opportunity. Earlier this summer, we welcome a group of investors to Warrendale, Pennsylvania at 1 of our [indiscernible] clinical care sites. The visit provided an opportunity to see the breadth of our specialty capabilities and the depth of our clinical expertise. A critical driver for the positive outcomes and impact we achieved for patients requiring complex and high-cost treatments for chronic conditions.\nHere are a few headlines from the day Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. [indiscernible] 5 years ago, when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, [indiscernible] was approximately a $30 billion business. Today, Accredo has grown to approximately $60 billion. In 2023 serves approximately 900,000 patients with some of the most complex conditions and needs. Accredo now represents about 40% of Evernorth's total revenue and because of its unique strengths, Accredo has grown faster than the overall marketplace. Second is secular tailwinds in the market creates significant growth opportunities as we look to the future. Those who need specialty drugs make up about 5% of the population and they drive more than 40% of total health care costs across medical, behavioral and pharmacy services. This is fueling expected mid- to high single-digit annual growth in what is already a specialty pharmaceutical market of approximately $380 billion.\nBiosimilars represent a force of change and a substantial opportunity for further growth and impact, and we will leverage them for greater affordability for clients and patients. We've long been a leader in supporting greater adoption of biosimilars as we did with the wave of generic medications when they became available decades ago. And like generics, we believe biosimilars will drive much needed affordability improvements for those we serve. And thereby, create more financial capacity to pay for new pharmaceutical innovations today and as we look to the future.\nThird is the breadth of our clinical capabilities and use of data that further fuels precision and impact. We've built and strengthened our clinical capabilities and far-reaching operating model over decades. Within Accredo, we have therapeutic resource centers with clinical teams of pharmacists, nurse, dietitians and social workers, specializing in different disease states such as blood and neurological disorders and multiple types of cancers.\nUnlike many of our competitors, we directly employ hundreds of field-based infusion nurses Today, they are located within 75 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population. And as they care for patients inside their homes, they provide better, more coordinated and personalized experiences, including addressing social determinants of health.\nWith the clinical care models focused on each individual patient, we're able to provide a level of personalized clinical support that is vital in specialty pharmacy. Many new high-cost drugs for oncology, gene therapies and repositions are coming to market, further pressuring affordability for clients and requiring greater support for patients that take these complex medications safely and effectively. I would note drug manufacturers also recognize our expertise and capabilities as well as our superior outcomes that we produce with our unique coordinated clinical model.\nPutting all this together, we're excited about the accelerated growth opportunities we have with Accredo's differentiated specialty pharmacy and view it as a powerful growth engine for our company today and into the future.\nNow stepping back to the enterprise level, I'll briefly recap. We drove strong earnings that built on our momentum from the first quarter and last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.13, strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth. Our progress gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance of adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023, and we also remain on track for adjusted EPS of at least $28 in 2024. This reinforces how we are creating value for our customers and clients and leveraging differentiated capabilities to give us flexibility to continue performing well in a dynamic environment. Now Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian?\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting continued execution across the enterprise. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 7% to $48.6 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion.\nRevenue and cash flow both exceeded expectations, while adjusted earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations. Our 2 platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting solid top and bottom line growth, while Cigna Healthcare delivered results in line with expectations despite an unfavorable risk adjustment impact in our individual exchange business, which I will discuss shortly.\nFirst, turning to Evernorth results. Evernorth continues to deliver strong performance, with second quarter 2023 revenues growing 10% to $38.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our differentiated specialty pharmacy business, which had year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and our focus on providing a variety of solutions that drive affordability and lowest net cost for our customers and clients.\nAdditionally, we continue to build out our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities [indiscernible] data and technology to accelerate innovation for customers and clients. And we also continue to make strategic investments to further enhance and expand our client relationships, diversify our portfolio of products and services, prepare for new clients in 2024 and advance our technology capabilities.\nOverall, Evernorth has delivered strong first half results and we are well positioned as we look to the back half of the year. Our diversified solutions allow us to sustain momentum by delivering differentiated value to our customers and clients, helping them overcome key healthcare challenges.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, the medical care ratio was 81.2%. The medical care ratio reflects some items specific to our individual exchange business that largely offset one another in the quarter.\nAfter receiving our first view of industry-wide risk adjustment data in early July, we increased our full year 2023 estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable. It's important to note, this was primarily driven by 2 states. Within those 2 states, the unfavorable impact from the first half of 2023 was about $80 million and was recognized in the second quarter. We expect a similar magnitude of impact in the back half of the year. Additionally, this impact is isolated to the 2023 calendar year as we have taken corrective pricing actions in the impacted geographies and in our 2024 REIT filings.\nSpecific to the second quarter, the unfavorable risk adjustment payable impact was largely offset by a favorable update to our 2022 risk adjustment receivable within the individual exchange business. Underlying fundamentals across the Cigna Healthcare segment continued to perform well as we further expanded our relationships and delivered affordability for our customers and clients. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we planned and priced for more normalized levels of utilization this year.\nOur year-to-date claims experience has been broadly in line with this expectation, across both commercial and Medicare Advantage.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers. growth of approximately 1.5 million customers year-to-date across all businesses. Within our government business, medical customers grew sequentially and year-to-date Medicare Advantage has grown 12%.\nOverall, Cigna Healthcare's results in the quarter were solid as we demonstrated strong underlying fundamentals despite the increased 2023 individual exchange risk adjustment payable previously mentioned. And we continue to grow our customer and client relationships, providing differentiated value and driving affordability.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023, consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $190 billion, driven by continued strength in our businesses as we continue to deliver innovative services and solutions for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $24.70 per share. And we expect adjusted EPS to be split approximately evenly between the third and fourth quarters.\nIn Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. With respect to Evernorth earnings cadence, we expect mid-single-digit year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the third quarter and mid- to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. We expect third quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly below 55% of second half adjusted earnings to reflect seasonal patterns as well as the rate and pace of investments. This incorporates the impact from the estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable in the second half of the year, which is offset by other items in Cigna Healthcare, including expense efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to expect our 2023 medical care ratio to be within the range of 81.5% to 82.3%.\nSwitching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through August 2, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $500 million to at least $9.5 billion for the full year.\nOur balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.\nNow to recap. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting high-quality underlying fundamentals in our foundational and accelerated businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.70. And we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our first quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the term label adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these results and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nRegarding our results effective January 1, 2023, we adopted amended accounting guidance for long-duration insurance contracts, LDTI and related amendments. Our 2023 full year outlook included the impact of LDTI and prior results have been restated to reflect this change. There has been no material impact to our prior results, and this change will not materially impact our future operating results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.\nWith that, I'll call -- turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cigna Corp.\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. We began 2023 with momentum. And in the first quarter, we again delivered strong performance and continued our long track record of innovating for customers, clients and partners. Today, I'll discuss some of the key drivers fueling our growth during the quarter and I'll also talk about how we're leading the way to address evolving stakeholder needs with a flexible and agile model, providing multiple avenues to deliver and capture value. Specifically, I'll describe how the durable and flexible pharmacy benefit services we offer continue to drive in the marketplace. Brian will provide additional detail about our financial results and discuss our outlook for 2023, and then we'll take your questions.\nWith that, let's get started. In the first quarter, we delivered $46.5 billion in total revenues, $5.41 in adjusted earnings per share, and we are raising our full year 2023 guidance for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth.\nWe are pleased with the strong start across Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. And we look forward -- as we look forward, we expect another very good year for the Cigna Group. Evernorth comprising pharmacy benefit services, Specialty Pharmacy and Evernorth Care, again contributed strong growth while retaining, expanding and winning new relationships for the employers, health plans and governmental organizations we serve. Our foundational Pharmacy Benefit Service business continued its strong performance, demonstrating the value we provide to our clients and patients. Specialty Pharmacy, which accounts for approximately 40% of Evernorth's total revenue drove outsized growth with a continued rise in new-to-market specialty drugs and increasing demand. Evernorth Care represents 1 of our most significant long-term growth opportunities given the growing needs in virtual care as well as, for example, [indiscernible] health services.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of revenue and customer growth with strong performance across our U.S. commercial, U.S. government and international health businesses. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we are pleased with our medical cost performance and our medical care ratio, which was 81.3%. Our U.S. commercial business is [indiscernible] for another good year. Our affordability initiatives continue to strengthen our overall competitive position, and this has helped fuel our strong customer growth. Our momentum also is a reflection of how employers of all sizes rely upon our consultative approach and the breadth of our solutions to support the health, engagement and productivity of their workforces.\nIn the U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market growth in 2023 and from our high-quality and affordable plans, our geographic expansion and the maturation of markets we previously expanded into. In the dynamic individual exchange market, we also have substantial growth in our Individual & Family Plan business, allowing us to bring Cigna Healthcare capabilities to a larger customer base. And in International Health, our earnings growth has been strong for the past few years, and we expect positive top line and bottom line contributions again in 2023 and given our high-quality and localized health insurance solutions supported by our global provider network. Overall, we're pleased with the quality, strength and resilience demonstrated in our results. And importantly, how they position us for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation.\nLooking ahead, we are confident in our increased outlook for the year as well as our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 13% compounded EPS growth over our strategic horizon, along with providing an attractive dividend.\nToday, I want to spend a few minutes on Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business within Evernorth, including our recent announcements about how we are continuing to provide greater affordability, choice and transparency for our clients and customers. Pharmacy services have an essential and impactful role in a time when in medical care, physical or behavioral are increasingly relying upon the use of pharmaceutical interventions. It's also important to recognize that successful care coordination programs for pharmacy services often creates significant benefit and value for the medical services.\nWe recognize the ongoing attention and legislative debate regarding the rising cost of prescription drugs. We are taking an active leadership role, and I want to be clear about how we are using our differentiated capabilities to create and capture value out of the drug supply chain on behalf of our clients and customers.\nFirst is the strength of our model. which is to deliver solutions and care coordination that address specific client needs and expand relationships with our full suite of services and capabilities, fueling our sustained attractive growth over time.\nSecond, we are committed to enabling and prioritizing choice for our clients as we drive down costs.\nAnd third, we continue to build on our long track record of innovation to drive greater affordability, access, transparency and improved clinical outcomes.\nStepping back, our pharmacy benefit service business is achieving attractive growth because we're able to secure a diverse group of any growing client base, leading with the strength of our supply chain, clinical and care management programs. With our proven model, Express Scripts' client retention rates are consistently in the mid-90s or higher, and we've been able to continuously grow our pipeline and win new business from medium-sized to the largest employers, from local health plans to national players and even the largest government-sponsored programs.\nWe've expanded our efforts to advocate on behalf of our clients and customers, particularly as it relates to financing models, which are key areas of focus for some of the current legislative proposals. Express Scripts business model starts with the commitment to enabling and prioritizing choice in benefit design and financing options for clients who are the primary financers of their employee benefit programs. This includes providing them the option to finance the cost of their programs by allowing us to share in the discounts we secure on their behalf, be it rebates or spread pricing. Our clients choose amongst these models based upon their needs for managing risk and greater predictability for their pharmacy costs as well as their cash flow.\nFor context, across the breadth of our Express Scripts pharmacy benefit service portfolio today, over 95% of rebate dollars are passed through to clients. The key point is that each client chooses the financing mechanism that works best for them. They have choices in how they pay for the value we deliver and many find that using rebate sharing or spread pricing generate a stronger level of aligned incentives in addition to being able to plan for predictable cash flow that it generates. Proposes to limit the availability and scope of these options will result in less choice for thousands of employers, health plans and government the clients we serve and increase their costs over time.\nAs it relates to Express Scripts, we are confident in our ability to earn sustainable and attractive margins for our services under a variety of legislative scenarios. We are able to create value through the breadth of our capabilities from supply chain to benefit design, driving competition amongst drug manufacturers to bring cost down and deliver better health outcomes through our clinical programs.\nOne area of focus for multiple stakeholders has been the amount of income we earn for rebate retention and retail spread. To put this in context, we expect about 20% of Evernorth's 2023 pretax adjusted earnings to come from Express Scripts retention of rebates and retail spread. This percentage has trended down over time. and we expect it to continue trending downwards. This is fueled by our ongoing innovation and greater diversification of our Evernorth businesses.\nI would also remind you that these financing options that we provide to clients are developed in exchange for lower service fees. So said otherwise, if these programs decrease further over time, fee-based income would increase. Therefore, we are confident that some of these payment vehicles will reduce or remove our regulatory change or client preference. Express Scripts has a broad set of capabilities that create value and will continue to earn an attractive return.\nLet me provide some specific examples that reinforce our flexibility and durable model and how we tap into our long track record of innovation for better outcomes on behalf of our customers and clients who are seeking greater affordability and transparency for prescription drugs. First, we are taking several steps to expand transparency. Express Scripts' new ClearCareRx fully demonstrates the flexibility we have for prescription drug benefits, where clients pay exactly what Express Scripts pays pharmacies for prescriptions. They received 100% of drug rebates that Express Scripts obtained by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies. They pay 1 service fee to cover the administration of pharmacy benefits, product services, reporting analytics, and the programs supported by a fully audible mechanism. In addition, clients also benefit from guarantees to keep Express Scripts accountable for clinical and financial performance measures including improvements in [indiscernible] and patient outcomes. Additional steps to drive even greater transparency include providing clients with enhanced financial and fee disclosures regarding their spread pricing programs when they exist.\nAlong with today's release about our first quarter financial results, you will also find additional disclosures we are providing about Express Scripts model in our quarterly regulatory filings and on our new micro site. We will also offer a new digital pharmacy benefit statement for customers, starting in 2024. The statement will share drug pricing information, out-of-pocket costs and the net value delivered by Express Scripts on behalf of customers.\nWith respect to the broader issue of drug pricing, to be clear, we are fully aligned with lowering cost of prescription drugs for customers. For example, Express Scripts patient assurance program launched in 2019, capped out-of-pocket costs for eligible members of select diabetes and cardiovascular medications. In 2022 alone, customers taking insulin saved more than $18 million because of this program. Now with the introduction of our new copay assurance plan, we are taking further action to cap out-of-pocket costs for customers in client prescription drug benefits. At $5 for generic drugs, $25 for preferred brand medications and $45 for preferred specialty medications.\nFinally, we also have a series of groundbreaking initiatives to further support pharmacists in the rural communities across the United States. We are offering increased reimbursement to true independent pharmacies and partnering opportunities to expand their clinical practices to further support care needs of the local communities. We are also convening an advisory committee of community pharmacies. These initiatives will encourage better care, expanded access to lower prices for rural Americans as well as increasingly more sustainable revenue stream for independent pharmacists. We are encouraged by how our recent actions have been received by a wide range of stakeholders, including clients, our pharmacy network partners and policymakers. They recognize our commitment is the leader and trusted partner that continues to create value through our deep expertise in designing programs for specific client needs, driving innovation and broadening our reach.\nIn summary, we are demonstrating our leadership in the competitive pharmacy benefits market that is such a critical building block for the American health care system. We are serving specific client needs through the strength of our model and the effectiveness of our care coordination programs, allowing us to drive sustained attractive growth. We are continuing to advocate for clients and their ability to choose the appropriate programs that work best for the business as we help lower costs. And we are continuing to innovate in driving greater affordability, transparency and improve outcomes for those we serve.\nNow let me briefly recap our performance for the quarter and our outlook. In the first quarter, we continued to execute and perform well. We deliver for our customer clients and partners and our business kept our commitment to our shareholders. We delivered adjusted EPS of $5.41 per share, and we're pleased to have increased our full year outlook for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth as well as an improved medical care ratio. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver and capture value into the dynamic and changing environment. We have shaped our business model to navigate varying economic conditions and our differentiated capabilities within Evernorth to provide us with the flexibility to meet unique client needs and potential changes caused by regulatory requirements. Additionally, our business is driving growth that is generating strong cash flows and we are confident that we will further create value through successful and effective capital deployment.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's first quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. The first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations demonstrating focused execution across our high-performing Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses.\nLooking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 6% to $46.5 billion. After-tax adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, and cash flow from operations of $5 billion. This performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.70 per share.\nBefore I discuss our Evernorth results, I'll build on David's comments regarding our recent announcement to advance transparency around our PBM, and I'll provide incremental details on our earnings drivers. I'd first start with a level setting that of our operating platform. Evernorth makes up approximately 60% of earnings and Cigna Healthcare is about 40%. Within Evernorth, our Express Scripts PBM is a foundational asset with a diverse set of earnings sources, including service and administrative fees, clinical programs, and value-based care arrangements, along with retained rebates and retail spread. These earnings sources are a function of the choices made by our clients.\nAs David referenced, approximately 20% of Evernorth's adjusted pretax earnings are comprised of PBM retained rebates and retail spread. This percentage has decreased over time as we continue to expand fee-based client relationships and as our Evernorth portfolio becomes more diverse and continues to grow. Importantly, as Evernorth's business mix has changed over the years, margins have remained stable. This speaks to our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing market and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate disruption in the operating or regulatory environment.\nAs David mentioned and I would underscore, our foundational PBM asset will continue to create and deliver significant value, which will allow us to sustain growth at attractive competitive returns. Shifting to our current period Evernorth results. First quarter 2023 revenues grew 8% to [indiscernible] billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, in line with our expectations. Evernorth results in the quarter were driven by continued strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, providing an additional avenue for growth as we further deepen our relationships across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nWe also continue to make strategic investments, which serve to strengthen and grow our client relationships, expand our portfolio of products and services and advance our digital capabilities. As it relates to our strategic partnerships, we remain on track in our implementation of the Centene contract that begins in 2024. And our collaboration with VillageMD is progressing and provides us an attractive opportunity to further accelerate our value-based care programs and capabilities. We will continue to expand these value-based solutions for the benefit of our Cigna Healthcare, U.S. commercial and U.S. government clients as well as other provider partners and Evernorth health plan clients. Additionally, we remain confident around the multiyear accelerating biosimilar opportunity with high visibility into expected savings for customers and clients in the second half of this year, consistent with our prior expectations and regardless of utilization shifts for product approvals in the market.\nOverall, Evernorth continues to perform very well. Our diversified set of earnings streams, along with flexible financing models enable us to innovate and adapt through dynamic environments.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. First quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion, slightly above our expectations. The medical care ratio of 81.3% was better than expectations as overall utilization came in slightly favorable. This was reinforced by our clinical engagement models and related affordability initiatives as well as our continued pricing discipline.\nTurning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers since the end of 2022. This strong growth demonstrates the continued differentiation of our market-leading products and services. Our commercial customers increased 8% year-to-date aided by the addition of a large fee-based health plan client that expands upon an existing Evernorth relationship. And even excluding this client win, we drove organic customer growth across all of our U.S. commercial market segments.\nIn our U.S. government business, we saw considerable growth in our U.S. Individual and Medicare Advantage customers, with MA growth of 10% on a year-to-date basis.\nOverall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2023 as we continue to deliver differentiated value and affordability to our customers and clients.\nAcross our Evernorth and Cigna Health care platforms, we delivered strong first quarter financial results driven by our diversified portfolio of foundational and accelerated growth businesses, further bolstered by cross enterprise leverage.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $188 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening customer relationships in Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $24.70 per share.\nConsistent with our prior commentary, we expect earnings this year to be back half weighted in large part driven by Evernorth's earnings ramp over the course of the year with second half EPS contributing slightly below 55% of full year EPS.\nIn Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance, all while investing in growth and innovation. We continue to expect Evernorth full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.3 million customers, an increase of 100,000 lives. We are improving our 2023 medical care ratio outlook to a range of 81.5% to 82.3%. And we are raising our expected full year 2023 adjusted earnings to at least $4.425 billion.\nDespite the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have yet to see material impact to Cigna Healthcare enrollment levels. We remain prudent with respect to our enrollment outlook for the rest of the year as evidenced by our full year guidance relative to the first quarter customer growth results. To be clear, we continue to expect underlying organic employer client growth as we move through the year. And our outlook continues to assume some elevated disenrollment in the second half of the year corresponding with some expected softening in the economy. Additionally, as a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate incremental customer growth from Medicaid redeterminations.\nFinally, when contemplating the Cigna Group's performance under various future economic scenarios, it's important to keep in mind that we have strategically positioned the company's portfolio of businesses to be more diversified than it was in prior economic downturns. This gives us confidence and resilience to weather dynamic macroeconomic environments. Switching gears.\nLet's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 42.2% as of March 31. We expect to lower this ratio over the balance of the year, and we continue to target a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Year-to-date through May 4, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. And for full year 2023, we continue to expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.\nSo now to recap. First quarter results were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio of complementary businesses. Evernorth continued to deliver strong results with the first quarter in line with our expectations. While Cigna Healthcare had a strong start to the year, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 EPS guidance of at least $24.70. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And over the long run, we continue to expect average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and are confident in our ability to adapt and navigate the operating and regulatory backdrop with our diversified business mix, and complementary capabilities across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. 2022 was a pivotal year of performance and growth for our company. Evernorth further expanded its health service reach and impact, and Cigna Healthcare demonstrated tremendous resilience in the dynamic market. Together, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and earnings outlook and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. This provides us with momentum as we begin 2023 and we expect another year of customer and earnings growth as we innovate and expand our broad portfolio of services and capabilities.\nToday, I'll provide perspective about our key drivers for our 2022 performance and how we're positioned for sustained growth going forward. Then Brian will walk through additional details about our 2022 financial results and discuss our '23 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. So let's jump in.\nAs we reflect on our performance for 2022, I'm proud of what the company and Cigna team delivered overall. We grew full year revenues to approximately $181 billion. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $23.27 reflecting a 14% rate of growth. We returned $9 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, and we sharpened the health service focus of our international business through the divestiture of our life accident and supplemental benefits businesses across 7 markets. This performance demonstrates how well our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are strategically positioned for sustained attractive growth. In 2022, Evernorth delivered strong top and bottom-line growth and also on renewed and expanded several large multiyear client relationships for 2023 and beyond. The depth of Evernorth's capabilities and expertise is highly valued by our clients and partners and enables us to deepen existing relationships across our entire portfolio of businesses. Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform also had a strong year, delivering customer growth along with differentiated medical cost performance for the benefit of our customers and clients. Our U.S. commercial business had a standout performance achieving outsized customer growth while maintaining pricing discipline and driving margin improvement. This reflects our ability of our commercial team to work consultatively to help employers of all sizes manage affordability, all while we support healthy, highly engaged employees for the benefit of their businesses. Overall, we're pleased with the strength of our 2022 performance across our enterprise.\nAs we look to 2023, we continue to deliver and capture meaningful value in multiple ways. First, we expect sustained growth through our foundational businesses, pharmacy benefit services, U.S. commercial and international health. These are mature scaled businesses that have established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental agencies. The value proposition for these businesses continues to resonate very well in the marketplace. In Pharmacy Benefit Services, we expect continued contributions in 2023 through the strength of our unique solutions and partnership orientation. With the strong selling season across our employer, health plan and governmental agency portfolio, we will continue delivering greater affordability to more customers and patients. Additionally, we are investing meaningfully to put in place the teams and resources to make prescriptions more accessible and affordable for approximately [20 million seventeen] customers starting in 2024.\nIn the U.S. commercial business, we also had a strong 2023 selling season across all our market segments and across all funding types, self-funded risk and shared return arrangements. As a result, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth. And in International Health, we expect continued revenue and earnings contributions through our leadership in meeting the health and moving needs in attractive growth markets and for the globally mobile.\nSecond, we expect outsized growth from our accelerated businesses, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and U.S. government. These businesses have differentiated capabilities and platforms addressing accelerated secular growth trends.\nWith Accredo, we were able to lower cost for patients and plans while preserving choice and flexibility for those who could benefit from new drugs. This includes our work to increase the availability of biosimilars. We've seen a handful of these lower-cost alternatives for biologic drugs launched in the past few years. and understand the exceptional value they deliver for the benefit of clients and customers. 2023 will mark the start of a growing market opportunity for biosimilars, a trend that we expect to continue ramping up in 2024 and beyond. This includes HUMIRA, a treatment for a range of inflammatory conditions and one of the top-selling drugs globally over the past decade. Now there's a biosimilar alternative that we've co-preferred on a national preferred formulary creating significant savings opportunities for clients and customers. We will continue our leadership in advocating for greater availability of biosimilars, which over time, we expect to drive even more savings and benefit for patients and clients.\nIn Evernorth Care Services, we are continuing to enhance and expand our portfolio of capabilities in care management and care delivery. Last year, MDLIVE virtual patient visits grew meaningfully, including a substantial increase in primary care visits. Demand and satisfaction with virtual care is rising and we will continue expanding our MDLIVE platform to provide even more of these options for the benefit of our customers. Evernorth Care Services is also accelerating our value-based care capabilities through our recently announced partnership with VillageMD. Our wrapping Evernorth health service capabilities with VillageMD's network of physicians, we will help guide more patients to high-quality care experiences at lower overall total costs. We expect this partnership to begin rolling out over the course of this year.\nIn the U.S. government, another accelerated business, we expect strong growth in 2023 as we expand services and our geographic presence across a large and growing addressable market. This includes Medicare Advantage, where we will introduce enhanced services and benefits, and we nearly doubled the size of our provider network over the last 2 years as we expand into new geographies. Additionally, as we have demonstrated continued consistent commitment to participating in the ACA exchange marketplace, in a dynamic environment, our Individual & Family Plan business, we will see outsized customer growth in 2023.\nThe third growth driver for us in 2023 and beyond is enterprise leverage. This is where our businesses work together to create or capture more value than anyone could achieve on their own. Here, think about our ability to look across our enterprise and client relationships to broaden and deepen them by leveraging our entire suite of capabilities. A great example is a new large service-based relationships for Cigna Healthcare where we were able to expand our support for a long-served Evernorth client. Additionally, the depth of clinical expertise success in advancing innovation and breadth of solutions within Evernorth, all combined to help further improve Cigna Healthcare's value proposition. For example, in 2022, by harnessing Evernorth's capabilities and programs, Cigna Healthcare delivered exceptional affordability, a key reason it continues to be competitively attractive option for employers of all sizes. This ability to deliver meaningful value is what makes Evernorth a partner of choice to a wide range of health plans, large employers and other clients.\nAnother way we generate enterprise leverage is with our longitudinal portfolio data, which enables us to accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers. This is specifically how we developed our pathway programs we're able to integrate Cigna Healthcare's high-performing provider networks and benefits management with Evernorth's analytical and clinical expertise as well as personalized digital support. This equips path well to lower cost while connecting patients with the right care, anticipating their future needs and helping them recover more quickly. [Path] of focus in 2023 includes musculoskeletal conditions and patients who take injectable or infusible biologic drugs. Early feedback here has been very positive, and we expect to support millions of patients throughout these programs with better experience, clinical quality, costs, resulting in improved overall value. These examples illustrate just some of the impact we've already achieved with our cross-enterprise leverage, and we'll continue acting on additional opportunities in the years ahead to expand relationships, accelerate innovation for the benefit of our customers patients and clients.\nNow I'll briefly summarize. 2022 was a strong year of performance and growth for our company. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, and our durable growth framework, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers, clients and partners as we look to the future. We are delivering on our commitments to our shareholders with our 2022 adjusted EPS of $23.27 and returning $9 billion in share repurchase and dividends. And we are also responding to evolving needs of those we serve in the coming years in the Healthcare environment of accelerated change. We have a differentiated innovation pipeline that will allow us to build on our momentum and create value, continue to advance our growth strategy. We are confident 2023 will be another year of strong performance for our company as we expect to deliver customer and earnings growth. Our EPS outlook of at least $24.60 and the 10% increase of our quarterly dividend reinforced our commitment to sustained impact and growth for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2023. We're very pleased with our strong performance in 2022. We reflecting focused execution and growth across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, with each segment achieving pretax adjusted earnings growth in line or above our long-term targets. This positions us well for continued growth in 2023. Looking at full year 2022 specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of approximately $181 billion, and adjusted earnings of $7.3 billion after tax or $23.27 per share, reflecting 14% growth from 2021. This is above the high end of our 10% to 13% and long-term average adjusted EPS growth target.\nRegarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2022 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth, is our innovation, market-leading clinical capabilities and proven track record of delivering for clients and customers continue to resonate in the market. Turning specifically to fourth quarter results for Evernorth, revenues grew to $36.2 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew 6% over fourth quarter 2021 to $1.7 billion. Similar to the first 3 quarters of 2022, Evernorth's strong results in the fourth quarter were driven by continued expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our specialty pharmacy as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continued to make meaningful strategic investments, which serve to strengthen our client relationships, expand our services portfolio and advance our digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers and expanding our partnerships and relationships, all while achieving strong revenue and pretax adjusted earnings growth in line with our long-term growth targets.\nOur recently announced collaboration with Centene that begins in 2024 as well as other large multiyear contracts we renewed for 2023 and further demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and proven partnership orientation in the market, providing long-term opportunities to grow while driving lower cost for our clients.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. As we enter 2022, we shared with all of you our goals of both growing our customer base and expanding margins. I'm pleased to report we ended the year accomplishing both of these goals, as we grew our medical customer base by 5% or 923,000 lives to 18 million total customers, while improving full year pretax adjusted margins to 9%. A year-over-year improvement of 90 basis points. Fourth quarter 2022 performance contributed to full year results with adjusted revenues of $11.1 billion, pretax adjusted earnings of $500 million and a medical care ratio of 84%. Despite an elevated flu and RSV season, our medical care ratio was slightly better than our expectations, particularly within our stop-loss products. Our medical care ratio for full year 2022 of 81.7% improved 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Both full year and fourth quarter results benefited from pricing discipline and affordability initiatives, including our clinical programs. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered for our customers, clients and partners, all while driving a strong year of customer growth and margin expansion with full year pretax adjusted earnings growth of 13%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range of 8% to 10%.\nTurning to Corporate and other operations. The fourth quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $382 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included earnings contributions from the International Life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, Cigna's 2022 results were strong, reflecting focused execution for the benefit of our clients and customers. As we turn to 2023, we continue to expect underlying growth in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to make strategic investments to drive future growth.\nFor the full year 2023 outlook, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $187 billion. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.33 billion or at least $24.60 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary on our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you this outlook includes a headwind from costs we will incur in 2023 to prepare for serving Centene's customers. This contract starts on January 1, 2024, and we look forward to many years of partnership and collaboration as we drive affordability for their customers. Additionally, with regards to earnings seasonality we would expect a different cadence this year when compared to historical patterns, with earnings more back half weighted. In first quarter, representing slightly above 20% of the full year EPS. For full year 2023, we project an adjusted SG&A expense ratio of approximately 7.3%. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 21% to 21.5%.\nI'll now discuss our 2023 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. Tailwinds and headwinds are largely consistent with the points we highlighted on our third quarter earnings call. These include tailwinds from a strong selling season and value creation from the increased availability of biosimilars, building in the second half of 2023 and ramping in 2024 and beyond. These are partly offset by headwinds from additional costs to support future growth, including implementation costs associated with onboarding Centene prior to receiving revenue, strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses and the expansion of our relationships with the Department of Defense in Prime Therapeutics.\nIn consideration of these tailwinds and headwinds, we expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to be weighted more towards the back half of the year, with low single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first half, followed by mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the second half. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.4 billion, representing growth of at least 8% year-over-year. We expect 2023 Cigna Healthcare earnings to be split closer to 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing. Key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2023 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2023 growth of at least 1.2 million customers, with growth across each of our U.S. commercial, Medicare Advantage and individual businesses. Within U.S. commercial, we expect organic customer growth across each of our national middle market and select market segments. And similar to 2022, the growth will primarily reflect fee-based customers.\nWe expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of at least high single digits, and we expect growth in our U.S. individual business of at least 300,000 customers, driven by geographic expansion, strong industry growth and the exit of competitors from certain geographies. We expect the 2023 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5% and in part reflecting an increased mix of government business, which tends to have a higher medical care ratio compared to U.S. commercial and international health. Additionally, we would expect the first quarter 2023 medical care ratio to be within the full year guidance range. As it relates to corporate and other operations, this segment has evolved given the divestiture of a portion of our international business last year that had been a positive earnings contributor in the first half of 2022. As a result, we expect the full year 2023 pretax adjusted loss to more closely reflect annualized fourth quarter 2022 results.\nNow moving to our capital management position and outlook. In 2022, we finished the year strong and delivered $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We returned $9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2022. Specific to share buyback, we repurchased 27.4 million shares for $7.6 billion. Additionally, our debt-to-cap ratio finished the year at 40.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points from year-end 2021. Now framing our capital outlook for 2023. We expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our enterprise. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures. These investments will include substantial commitments to our accelerated growth platforms of specialty pharmacy, Evernorth Care, and U.S. government. We expect to deploy approximately $1.45 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend of $1.23 per share, up 10% from 2022 on a per share basis. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2023, we have repurchased 1.6 million shares for $510 million. And our guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares to be in the range of 296 million to 300 million shares.\nOur balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. And now to recap. Our full year 2022 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2023 outlook reflects continued momentum across our segments as we invest to support long-term attractive growth. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 full year adjusted earnings of at least $24.60 per share. And we continue to expect to deliver 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior EPS commentary.\nWith that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our team is performing well in a dynamic environment, and we delivered another strong quarter of revenue, earnings and cash flows. I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting key drivers of our results in the third quarter and while we are once again raising our 2022 full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share as well as for growth in medical customers and enterprise revenues. Then I'll address how we continue to expand and enhance our capabilities for the evolving market needs, and I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2023.\nBrian will share more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll take your questions. With that, let's get started.\nDuring the third quarter, we delivered results that were better than our expectations, including total revenues of $45.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. We continued to building out our momentum this year, and we are confident we will deliver on our increased full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10. We also expect to continue advancing our capital deployment strategy, including investing in our business to drive innovation and growth and repurchasing at least $7 billion of our shares this year, all while paying a meaningful dividend.\nOur performance in the quarter reinforces the impact of our sustained commitment to service and innovation, our progress in retaining clients and expanding relationships with additional services as well as winning new business. Evernorth, our health service platform performed well again with solid top line and bottom line results driven by our market-leading innovation and affordability across our pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy and Evernorth Care Solutions.\nCigna Healthcare, our benefits portfolio also was key to continuing our momentum in the quarter. Our U.S. commercial business is having a very good year with solid client retention levels and new business wins, particularly in the middle market and select segments, leading us to once again raise our full year outlook for medical customers. Our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was better than expectations at 80.8% in the third quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our affordability initiatives and targeted pricing actions.\nOverall, we're very pleased with the third quarter results. Now I'll take a few minutes to walk through how we are well positioned going forward with Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Within both platforms, we have differentiated businesses and a clear, durable 3-part growth framework. First, through our foundational businesses, including our Pharmacy Benefit Services, U.S. Commercial and International Health Businesses. With these mature scale businesses, we established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental entities. Our capital-efficient operating models will further support steady growth as well as strategic and financial flexibility for our company.\nAs we look ahead for these businesses, in 2023, Pharmacy Benefit Services, we're expecting another year of high client retention levels complemented with new business wins. We're also very pleased with our solid start to the selling season for 2024, including our new multiyear agreement for Express Scripts to be the pharmacy benefits and specialty services provider for Centene. Working with Centene, we will make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible for approximately 20 million Centene members. The strategic collaboration with Centene builds on Express Scripts' track record as a partner of choice and will present growth opportunities to provide additional Evernorth Health services over time. We continue showing how we have a unique ability to partner across the healthcare landscape, expanding our reach and impact to more customers and patients, and with this new health plan relationship, we are building on our previous collaborations such as Prime Therapeutics, Oscar and Kaiser Permanente.\nFor U.S. commercial, we are driving strong customer growth with wins throughout 2022, enabled by our consultative sales approach and our affordability gains, enhancing more competitiveness in more geographies, all while maintaining ongoing pricing discipline. The sales and net growth in our National Accounts segment are solid and outpaced prior year results, and we are confident this momentum carries into 2023. And in international health, we are sharpening our healthcare focus for targeted growth opportunities in serving individuals, employers seeking healthy and productive employees and governmental entities that value our care management programs. We have momentum this year in customer growth, revenue and earnings and expect to sustain these results and performance throughout 2023.\nThe second way we drive growth is through our Accelerated businesses, which include Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and our U.S. government business. These businesses have outsized opportunities to grow with compelling secular tailwinds as well as differentiated capabilities that benefit our clients and customers. Looking forward for our Accelerated businesses, we continue to be excited about the value creation opportunities in specialty pharmaceuticals, including biosimilars over the next several years. With our leading capabilities and expertise, we expanded our relationship to be the exclusive specialty pharmacy provider for the Department of Defense starting in 2023.\nThis is further reinforcement to how we fuel sustained long-term growth in Evernorth by improving clinical quality for the benefit of patients and achieving significant savings for our clients. In Evernorth Care Services, we are advancing our care management and delivery strategies. One area of focus is enhancing virtual care that strengthens relationships between patients and their physicians to better anticipate health issues and intervene earlier.\nFor example, with MDLIVE, we are providing better experiences and improved affordability with personalized care that is more convenient and effective in directing patients to the most appropriate care settings. When a person -- when in-person care is needed, MDLIVE successfully guide patients to urgent care facilities or other alternative sites to care, decreasing avoidable emergency room visits by at least 10%. We intend to further build on this progress by enhancing our virtual primary care offerings for patients with chronic conditions by providing continuous engagement with their physician, remote monitoring with connected devices and real-time interventions between appointments.\nIn U.S. government, we are continuing to make investments, positioning us to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are strengthening this business by building on our high-quality affordable Medicare Advantage benefits we offer with geographic and network expansion as well as further product enhancements.\nFinally, the third way we drive growth is through a cross-enterprise leverage. Here, we harness capabilities across our company to accelerate innovation and have a greater impact than any individual could have on its own. Our opportunities here are driven in part by a rich longitudinal data and information we have to accelerate the development of new, more effective solutions for our clients and customers. Our Pathwell programs are a good example. With Pathwell Specialty, we're working across the medical and pharmacy benefits to reduce the cost of specialty infusions and injectables. In our Pathwell Bone and Joint program, we harness Evernorth digital navigation and advanced predictive analytical capabilities to reduce unnecessary musculoskeletal surgeries and provide better coordinated care. There is a significant addressable market for these programs as 50% of adults suffer from bone, joint and muscle conditions, and these are major drivers to U.S. healthcare costs.\nAdditionally, we continue to take an enterprise view of our client relationships and successfully broaden and deepen them with our overall suite of capabilities. This has supported a number of attractive wins and a good example is a very large new fee-based relationship for 2023 in our U.S. commercial team that has secured this offering by bringing a solution to a long-standing Express Scripts client. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and our growth framework, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth in 2023.\nWe will provide detailed guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter earnings call. Having said that, I'll provide a view of some of the tailwinds and headwinds we see for 2023, which are largely consistent with the points we highlighted at our Investor Day in June. With a strong selling season, we anticipate a tailwind of continued growth across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms. We expect additional margin improvement in Cigna Healthcare and with our leading position in the rapidly growing specialty pharmaceuticals market will begin capturing value from biosimilars.\nRelative to anticipated headwinds, we will make meaningful strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses. We will have additional costs as well as we prepare to support renewed and expanded relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. And a new development since Investor Day is our exciting strategic win with Centene, which will create a 1-year headwind as we onboard this new partner. Putting all that together, we anticipate that these tailwinds and headwinds will largely balance themselves off next year with the exception of our Centene headwind, which represents incremental cost for us in 2023.\nNow I'll briefly summarize. Overall, our strong performance in the quarter and throughout the year shows how we are addressing the most pressing needs of our customers and clients and growing our business. We're investing in innovation to enhance our capabilities for future growth and continue delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're confident we remain on track for our full year 2022 commitments, including our increased adjusted EPS guidance for this year of at least $23.10. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're proud of another strong quarter and are pleased to drive continued momentum from the first half of 2022, with third quarter adjusted earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Looking at the quarter specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.3 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04.\nRegarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. We are pleased with the continued profitable growth in Evernorth, with our client-centric approach, deep pharmacy expertise and strong track record of service continues to resonate with new and existing clients. One good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Centene that will deliver greater prescription drug affordability and access for their approximately 20 million customers starting in January of 2024.\nThis mutually beneficial partnership will bring significant revenue and will be financially accretive over the course of the multiyear contract term. Turning to third quarter results for Evernorth. Revenues grew 6% over third quarter 2021 to $35.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued expansion of our Accelerate growth businesses led by our specialty pharmacy, as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers.\nWe also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments, which serve to deepen our client relationships and expand our services portfolio and digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another quarter of strong results, consistent with our expectations.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Our 2021 results presented an opportunity to expand future margins, and our team has executed extremely well and achieved both strong membership growth and improved profitability here in 2022. Third quarter 2022 performance continued this pattern as adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion and the medical care ratio was 80.8%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations and continues to demonstrate the impact of our affordability initiatives and pricing discipline. The favorable medical costs in the quarter were partially offset by lower net investment income.\nTurning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 18 million total medical customers, growth of 873,000 customers or 5% year-to-date. We continue to drive strong customer and client growth in our U.S. Commercial and International Health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022. For corporate and other operations, the third quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $299 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included our earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, we delivered strong third quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our foundational and accelerated growth businesses.\nNow turning to our outlook for full year 2022. We have positioned the enterprise for continued strong performance in these dynamic times. As demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results and heightened reinvestment into our business. With that said, we remain mindful of the current economic backdrop and utilization environment heading into the upcoming winter months.\nIn light of these moving pieces, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $179 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nWe are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers while expanding margins over 2021. We are improving our expected 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.2%. We are raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings to approximately $4.05 billion. And we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to approximately 900,000 customers, which reflects strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses.\nOur full year 2022 enterprise SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments into our business. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 3, 2022, we expect to have repurchased approximately 22 million shares of common stock for $5.8 billion, including the accelerated share repurchase agreements announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. And during the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow from operations of $3.3 billion. We remain on track for another strong year of cash generation, providing us the fuel and flexibility for ongoing capital deployment opportunities.\nOur balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, dollar margins and attractive returns on capital.\nNow to recap. Results in the third quarter were above expectations, reflecting strong growth across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins, giving us confidence we will deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10 per share. We remain well positioned and expect another year of customer, revenue and earnings growth in 2023.\nRelative to 2023, we deem the current consensus EPS to be reasonable when excluding the Centene contract win. Although consistent with our historical approach, our initial guidance would have likely started more prudently. As David mentioned, Centene implementation-related costs introduced a net new headwind for our 2023 financials. That said, we expect the 2-year compounded EPS growth rate from 2022 to 2024 to be within our long-term average 10% to 13% annual range, driven by the strong earnings contribution from our broad portfolio as well as 2024 contributions from the Centene contract win, following the implementation cost impact that we will incur in 2023.\nWe look forward to providing you with more detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter call. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.\nWe'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Cigna Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.\nIn our remarks today, David and Brian are going to cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2022 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for the year.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.\nWe use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.\nIn our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties and is contained in the cautionary note of today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nBefore turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $26 million or $0.08 per share for integration and transaction-related costs and $17 million or $0.05 per share related to a strategic plan to further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency.\nWe also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $20 million or $0.06 per share associated with litigation matters.\nAs described in today's earnings release, Special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today.\nAs a reminder, we completed the sale of our international life accident and supplemental businesses to Chubb on July 1, which is contemplated in our prospective statements.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In the second quarter, our company continued delivering differentiated value for our clients, customers, patients and partners as we execute on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. And we posted strong results for the quarter and continue to build on our momentum from the first quarter.\nNow today, I'll briefly discuss our quarterly performance and the key strategic drivers of our growth, then Brian will review additional details about our financial results during the quarter, our increased outlook for the rest of 2002 as well as our strong capital position. and then we'll take your questions. Let's get started.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $45.5 million and adjusted EPS of $6.22 per share. Our differentiated capabilities and innovative approaches are resonating in the market, and we achieved another quarter of strong performance across our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we're pleased with the way our solutions are continuing to gain traction with health plans, large commercial employers, governmental agencies, health care delivery systems and medical professionals.\nToday, more than 180 million individual customers have access to our Evernorth solutions. We're also encouraged by our progress during the selling season for 2023, and we are on track for another year of high client retention levels.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, our disciplined execution is driving a balance of sustained customer growth and continued progress with expanding margins. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 80.7%, which was better than expected and a substantial improvement over the same period last year.\nSimilar to last quarter, we continue to see a positive impact from the targeted pricing and affordability actions we put in place last year and in early 2022. Overall results during the first half of the year, including the strength of our ongoing performance give us confidence in delivering our increased full year 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.90.\nAdditionally, we recently completed the divestiture of our life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in 6 markets across Asia Pacific to Chubb, and we launched a $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At current levels, we view this as an attractive use of our capital. When combined with our previously completed activity, we remain on track to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022.\nOverall, we delivered a strong first half of 2022, and we are positioned to deliver on our increased outlook for revenue, customer growth and EPS for this year. Our performance is a direct result of our ability to leverage our expertise, capabilities and ongoing commitment to innovation, all focused on the most pressing needs of those we serve.\nAffordability remains first and foremost, a top need for all of our stakeholders. In response to this, we continue to drive target innovations, including, for example, a new solution launched in June that leverages our capabilities at eviCore to support post-acute care for Cigna Medicare Advantage patients.\nAs the patient prepares for a discharge from a hospital, our team draws upon the extensive evidence-based guidelines as well as analytics we have to work closely with providers and patients. The result is that we're able to determine the most appropriate site of care and services to support a patient's recovery, which improves health outcomes, drives meaningful cost savings and provides better patient experience and satisfaction.\nWe've also launched a number of programs that address the rising costs of vital medications. Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth's patient assurance program is an industry-first innovation capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin. In 2021 alone, we provided more than $42 million of financial relief to approximately 220,000 patients with diabetes.\nWe've continued to broaden the impact of this program by expanding it to other chronic conditions drawing on the strength of our expertise as well as our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nBuilding on the success of this program, last month, our U.S. commercial business introduced Cigna Pathwell Specialty, a new approach to specialty care. Pathwell Specialty leverages our specialty capabilities in Cigna and Evernorth and provides enhanced support to patients for better outcomes while also controlling rising specialty costs. We plan to extend this offering to additional groups of clients later this year.\nAt our Investor Day in June, we talked about how we're able to consistently deliver sustained attractive healthy growth even in challenging economic environments. Our company is built to perform in a variety of market conditions, including economic slowdowns. It starts with our growth framework that positions us to expand our addressable markets and capture value in 3 specific ways.\nFirst, foundational growth. to our businesses that are mature, scaled and contribute steady predictable results for our company. These businesses currently contribute about 60% of our annual revenue and include Express Scripts, U.S. commercial and our international health business.\nSecond is accelerated growth for our businesses with differentiated capabilities aided by secular trends creating very attractive addressable markets. These businesses represent about 40% of our company's revenues, and we expect to grow these further with momentum from our specialty pharmacy and care services businesses within Evernorth and our U.S. government business in Cigna Healthcare.\nAnd third, cross-enterprise leverage, where businesses work together to create value and capture more value than any one of them could achieve on the road. Putting it all together, this growth framework translates into continued strong top and bottom line contributions from Evernorth.\nOur health service platform continues to providing industry-leading pharmacy solutions while also building out our Evernorth Care capabilities to address the growing demand for behavioral services, health coaching and care delivery.\nEvernorth strengthens our ability to support customers and clients with the forces facing and reshaping health care today, including the significant societal shift, bringing widespread and growing recognition of the connection between mental and physical health. This has resulted, for example, in a rising demand for services, and we've continued to expand our traditional network.\nFor example, Evernorth behavioral network has more than doubled in size over the past 5 years. We're also supporting enhanced services by providing virtual care. Recently, we launched Confide Behavioral Health Navigator to improve the way we guide people to the right behavioral care at the right setting at the right time.\nWe also have an extensive and growing portfolio of solutions, supporting both virtual and digital first solutions, including our MDLive platform.\nFor Cigna Healthcare, our growth framework translates into strong performance driven by ongoing customer growth in U.S. commercial as we continue to improve affordability in key geographies, including through advancing our value-based care and site of care service programs. Also accelerating Cigna Healthcare's adoption of Evernorth Solutions, which creates even greater value for our customers and clients and as a driver of attractive sustainable revenue growth for Evernorth.\nIn International Health, following the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits portfolio, we are intensifying our focus on health and health service offerings. And in U.S. government, both for Medicare Advantage and individual family plans, we are delivering strong value for those we serve while we're investing in markets where we see sustained path for growth and a clear right to win over the long term.\nThis balance and diversified approach to growth, together with our substantial capital generation affords us a significant level of strategic and financial flexibility that positions us for sustained, differentiated growth under a variety of scenarios.\nNow to wrap up. We delivered on our customer client commitments in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive continued attractive healthy growth across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms by leveraging our portfolio of foundational assets, accelerated growth businesses and fueled by the power of our cross-enterprise leverage.\nWe are encouraged by our strong retention outlook for the start of 2023 as well as new business wins for the start of the year. We remain on track for continued delivery of our commitments. And as a result, we are increasing our full year outlook to at least $22.90 per EPS, which represents a growth rate of 12%, which is within our long-term average annual adjusted EPS growth target of 10% to 13%.\nWe're continuing to deliver significant value for our shareholders, and we expect to deliver at least $7 billion through share repurchase in 2022 as well as continue to pay a meaningful dividend. We also continue to make strategic investments to strengthen our capabilities and broaden our reach in both our foundational and accelerated growth businesses.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2022 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year.\nWe have delivered strong customer revenue and earnings growth in the first half of 2022. Continuing our momentum from the first quarter, with second quarter earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% off of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS.\nThis updated outlook reflects the strength of our foundational and accelerated growth businesses, coupled with cross enterprise leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nLooking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.5 billion, After-tax adjusted earnings of $2 billion, representing growth of 10% over second quarter 2021 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.22. These results reflect a better-than-expected medical care ratio in Cigna Healthcare and continued strong performance within our Evernorth portfolio.\nRegarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 7% over second quarter 2021 to $34.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by the expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our high-performing specialty pharmacy as well as a continued focus on affordability by delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers.\nWe also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments which serve to deepen our client relationships, develop new solutions and enhanced digital capabilities to expand our services in the Evernorth Care business. Overall, Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, consistent with our expectations.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.3 billion, Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.7%. The better-than-expected medical care ratio in the quarter, was the primary driver of Cigna Healthcare's earnings results exceeding our expectations. The strength in our MCR was driven by a combination of strong pricing actions taken over the past 12 months, our continued affordability initiatives to lower cost for our clients and lower-than-expected utilization within the quarter.\nNon-COVID costs in the quarter were better than expectations across most service categories driven by lower levels in inpatient, emergency room care and surgeries and direct COVID costs were also lower than projected.\nImportantly, leveraging our customer engagement model, we are seeing preventive care utilization in line with pre-pandemic levels, including items such as annual exams, colonoscopies and mammograms.\nTurning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 725,000 customers or 4% year-to-date. Our select market segment within U.S. commercial has already grown 6% year-to-date and remains on track for high single-digit growth in customers by the end of the year. Total medical customers for the quarter were above our expectations as we've seen continued growth and strong retention in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses.\nOverall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022. The margin improvement reflects our pricing actions and affordability initiatives taken over the course of the past year.\nFor Corporate and other operations, the second quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $168 million. Overall, we delivered strong second quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our diversified portfolio.\nNow with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong execution driving attractive top and bottom line growth, all while investing in innovation for the future. We are now raising our Evernorth full year adjusted earnings to approximately $6.125 billion.\nIn Cigna Healthcare, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2022, and we are now updating our 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.5%, an improvement from our prior range. We are also raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to approximately $4.025 billion. And we are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 800,000 customers, which includes strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our foundational U.S. commercial and international health businesses.\nTurning to enterprise revenue. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $178 billion. Enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.\nOur full year 2022 SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 7.1% to 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Taken as a whole, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS.\nNow moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Our businesses continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive returns on capital. Year-to-date, as of June 30, 2022, we have repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, in July, we received an initial delivery of 10.4 million shares of our common stock in accordance with the accelerated share repurchase we announced in June.\nWe also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. We have also increased our outlook for full year cash flow from operations to at least $8.5 billion, generating a very attractive cash flow yield. And we now expect full year weighted average shares of 312 million to 314 million shares, representing an increase of 1 million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to the sale of our international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses being completed slightly later than we originally had anticipated.\nOur balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.\nNow we would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the macroeconomic environment, which carries potential risks but also opportunities. We have a strong and resilient enterprise with a diverse service-based framework, spanning broad addressable markets. And our first half results demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and strength of our execution in a dynamic environment.\nWe continue to proactively prepare with a variety of actions and tools to respond to evolving economic conditions and we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow and deliver strong value to our customers, clients and shareholders.\nNow to recap. Results in the second quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong fundamentals across our diversified portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results, while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins, giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $22.90.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Also, our full year 2022 outlook assumes that the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of 2022, but does not assume any impact from other business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today.\nFinally, I'd like to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day on June 3 in New York City, where we look forward to sharing our strategy and opportunities for sustained success and growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We're off to a very good start to the year with the first quarter defined by strong results across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, positive momentum and focused execution, all of which are advancing our strategy and driving growth. We're pleased with our performance overall specifically with delivering adjusted EPS above our initial expectations. Today, I'm going to keep my comments relatively brief and focus on some of the key drivers of our performance. Brian will then provide additional details about our financial results and our outlook for 2022, and we'll take your questions. Then on June 3, we'll host our Investor Day, we will provide a deeper level of insights relative to our strategic vision, the growth profile of our businesses and differentiated drivers that will deliver sustained attractive growth. So let's jump in.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and $6.01 of adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our strong results this quarter, we are now raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance, underscoring our view that we will achieve another strong year of performance for our company in 2022. We also remain on track to generate $12 billion in deployable capital for the year and directing at least $7 billion to repurchase our shares.\nI want to take a minute to thank our team for all their hard work that led to these outstanding results. Our more than 70,000 colleagues around the world are committed to delivering on our promise in the market day-in, day-out. And as a result, expanding our client customer relationships, all of which enables us to grow and deliver strong results for our shareholders.\nNow let's take a deeper look at Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and the drivers of their performance. Following an outstanding year of growth in 2021, Evernorth maintained momentum with strong top and bottom line results in the quarter, driven in part by the sustained growth of our Accredo and CuraScript's Specialty Pharmacy business, which continues to represent one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio. The key driver of this performance is the way in which Evernorth is increasingly resonating with a wide range of buyers, including employers, health plans, governmental organizations and health care delivery systems.\nIn this environment, we're getting people the right care and treatment at an affordable price is of paramount importance. I spent meaningful time over the past few months meeting with a number of our clients and partners, and they consistently point to the attractive breadth and depth of Evernorth's services and expertise. Our clients rely upon these services and expertise to solve the most pressing health care needs. For some clients, this means tapping into the strength of our pharmacy services. Others that meet me are behavioral health support. With others, the unique Specialty Pharmacy expertise we bring to the table.\nMore and more, our clients are seeking our solutions that leverage our broad high-performing portfolio of capabilities. For example, Evernorth recently launched a new provider consult service for patients with cancer. This service leverages our powerful analytics to identify and connect patients to their oncologists, to cancer subspecialty experts and designated National Cancer Institute Centers. And this process enables patients to gain access to the latest innovations and research with better health outcomes, lower costs and importantly, keeps the patient's care close to home and their family. This service augments our existing suite of oncology solutions, including personalized case management, mental health care, financial support services, pharmacy solutions and collaborative partnerships with oncology providers.\nAdditionally, on the strength of our offerings a couple of weeks ago, we announced a new long-term strategic collaboration between Evernorth and Kaiser Permanente. We're drawing on capabilities across both Evernorth and our Cigna Healthcare platforms in a way that creates new opportunities for serving a broad range of Kaiser's clients and customers. This builds on our successful relationships, for example, with Prime Therapeutics and the Department of Defense, both of which were recently renewed for extended contract periods.\nFinally, it's still early into 2022 selling season, but we are continuing to see strong demand for our Evernorth services amongst existing and new clients and additional opportunities to deliver even more value, particularly as we expect more biosimilars to come to market over the coming years, and we are seeing strong retention in our Evernorth portfolio of businesses.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare. We delivered a strong start to the year. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 81.5%, which was better than we had projected. This respect reflects the disciplined and targeted actions we initiated last year to improve our results including implementing new affordability efforts and pricing actions. In U.S. Commercial, we achieved strong membership growth during the quarter with growth across each of our segments. At a time when employers are trying to navigate a complex economic landscape for their businesses and an emotionally taxing environment for their employees, many are turning to us as the right strategic growth partner to improve presenteeism, productivity and health outcomes.\nEmployers tell us that they value the ability of our U.S. commercial teams to partner with them in developing programs that guide employees to the right care, at the right place, at the right time. Programs supporting them and attracting and retaining talent through strong employer-sponsor benefits, programs and services, and programs providing greater predictability in managing financial risk for the companies, while optimizing their cash flow during these uncertain times.\nOur International business also contributed to our growth during the quarter as it achieved higher customer retention and membership growth levels. We also remain on track with the divestiture of our international life, accident and supplemental benefits business in certain countries (inaudible). With our sharpened focus on health services, we continue to see attractive opportunities for serving multinational employers and to governmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the globally mobile population.\nIn our U.S. Government business, enrollment was down as expected as we prioritize margin expansion and completed the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. We continue to take actions to position our Government business for growth in 2023 and over the long term.\nNow to wrap up. Our first quarter results are strong. They underscore the momentum we're building as we serve the evolving needs of our customers and clients, as well as continue to drive growth and margin improvement in our company. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.01 and we continue to make strategic investments in our business while paying a meaningful dividend and remaining on path to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. With focused execution, we are demonstrating our ability to navigate and lead through this continued dynamic environment for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\nAnd now with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's First Quarter 2022 Results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. As David noted, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year as first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations. This performance, combined with our continued momentum give us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% off of our reported 2021 EPS.\nLooking at the first quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include adjusted revenue growth of 8% to $44.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.01. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 10% to $33.6 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, both in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong growth in our high-performing Specialty Pharmacy business and a continued focus on delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers.\nWe also continue to make meaningful strategic investments for the expansion of client relationships, as well as a new solution development and digital capabilities. These investments ensure the continued differentiation of our scaled Evernorth businesses, and support the expansion of our Evernorth Care capabilities. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well with attractive top and bottom line growth in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare, which is a reminder, now includes our U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and retained International Health businesses. We ended the year prioritizing margin expansion having taken targeted pricing and affordability actions during 2021 for impact in 2022. We also expected to drive customer growth in each of our U.S. Commercial market segments, and we're pleased with how we started the year.\nFor Cigna Healthcare overall, first quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.4 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.5%. The medical care ratio was better than our expectations in the quarter, primarily due to lower COVID testing and treatment costs. In January, COVID incidence was at its highest level throughout the pandemic, but case counts dropped significantly in February and March. Importantly, even during the January Omicron peak, we observed substantially lower severity than earlier in the pandemic and subsequently, lower treatment costs.\nIn total, Cigna Healthcare's earnings exceeded our expectations, driven by the favorable medical care ratio, strong specialty contributions and net investment income on our alternative asset portfolio. Net medical customer growth in Cigna Healthcare was also strong. As clients and customers continue to recognize the differentiated value we bring as a partner through our consultative approach and our innovative solutions.\nWe ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of 4% or approximately 700,000 customers sequentially. This growth was driven almost entirely by an increase in fee-based customers. Notably, we grew across all of our U.S. Commercial market segments and in International Health. U.S. Government enrollment decreased as expected, inclusive of the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2022. For Corporate and Other Operations, the first quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $117 million. Across the enterprise, we delivered strong first quarter financial results with contributions across our diversified portfolio.\nNow with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, our strong start gives us the confidence to increase our full year earnings per share outlook as I will detail in a moment. At Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance with both top and bottom line growth in line with long-term targets, all while continuing to invest in growth and innovation. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers while expanding margins over 2021. We are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 725,000 customers, and reaffirming our 2022 medical care ratio outlook of 82% to 83.5%. For Cigna Healthcare in total, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.95 billion.\nTaken as a whole, we are raising our EPS guidance and now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% over our reported 2021 earnings per share.\nNow moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive returns on capital. In the first quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $1.12 per share. And year-to-date, as of May 5, 2022, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion.\nFor full year 2022, we continue to expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations, and to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases. We now expect full year weighted average shares of 310 million to 314 million shares, an increase of 2 million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to our updated expectation for the timing of closing the international divestiture. We now expect this to occur later in the second quarter impacting the timing of our anticipated share repurchase.\nAs a reminder, the financial performance of this business is included within Corporate and Other Operations until the divestiture is complete. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.\nSo now to recap. Results in the first quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver strong top and bottom line growth in line with our expectations while Cigna Healthcare has had a strong start to the year, giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.60.\nI look forward to continuing to discuss our performance, our strategy and our long-term financial outlook with all of you in our upcoming Investor Day on June 3.\nAnd with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe.\n\nRalph Giacobbe\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Cigna Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.\nIn our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's Fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2022.\nAs noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.\nWe use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note of today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.\nBefore turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, as previously disclosed with our Form 8-K filing and investor call on January 24, we announced changes in our segment reporting effective for the fourth quarter of 2021. These changes were made to align with the company's organizational structure as a result of the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses in 7 Asia Pacific markets.\nEffective in the fourth quarter, Cigna's results will be reported through the following 3 groups: Evernorth, Cigna Healthcare and Corporate and Other operations. The international businesses that will be divested pending the close of the transaction will now be reported in Other Operations, which is included within Corporate and Other Operations in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.\nThe international health business to be retained by Cigna will join our U.S. commercial and U.S. government offerings in a new segment called Cigna HealthCare. This segment replaces the prior U.S. Medical segment.\nSecond, regarding our results. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $119 million or $0.36 per share related to a strategic plan to further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency through enhancements to organizational structure and increased use of automation and shared services.\nWe also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $70 million or $0.21 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results.\nAdditionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends.\nAlso, our full year 2022 outlook assumes that the pending divestiture of Cigna's International Life Accident and Supplemental Benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of 2022, but does not assume any impact from other business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today.\nFinally, I would like to announce our intention to host an Investor Day in June where we will discuss our long-term strategic growth and value creation story. We look forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Michael Cordani\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. As we step into 2022, our clients, customers and patients continue to face a rapidly changing landscape with new COVID variants, changing testing and treatment protocols and pressures on the global economy.\nThroughout these challenges, we remain focused on addressing and balancing the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders. As a result, our 70,000-plus colleagues around the world continue to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and also continue to grow our businesses. Today, I'll share a perspective around our 2021 performance and the sustained growth opportunities we see for our organization in the year ahead. And Brian will provide additional details about our 2021 financial results and our 2022 outlook.\nThen we'll take your questions. With that, let's get started. In 2021, we grew full year adjusted revenues to $174 billion, a second consecutive year of growth above our long-term target. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% and to $20.47, and we returned over $9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.\nAdditionally, we continue to invest in our capabilities to ensure we are positioned for sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. Our growth is and will continue to be fueled by our 2 high-performing platforms: Evernorth, our health services business, including pharmacy, care, benefits and intelligence services; and Cigna Healthcare, which includes our portfolio of U.S. commercial, U.S. government and international health businesses.\nOur Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms complement each other through the breadth of their capabilities and the ability to serve multiple buyer groups. Here, we typically lead with either a medical or pharmacy solution and then we build on those relationships by innovating and delivering new services.\nWe have a proven track record with this approach, a diverse, high-performing portfolio of solutions and a sustained commitment to continued innovation to expand that portfolio. Additionally, we are positioned so that accelerated growth in 1 area can compensate for temporary pressure in another business within our portfolio.\nWe see this as extremely valuable in a dynamic environment. Relative to our 2021 performance, it was a very strong year for Evernorth. We grew adjusted revenues by 14% in 2021 as Evernorth's corporate clients, health plans, governmental agencies and health care delivery system partners increasingly recognized the value of our health services, including in our specialty pharmacy business, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment; in our virtual health capabilities, which have been expanded through MDLIVE to include urgent and dermatology care as well as behavioral health services; in our core pharmacy services portfolio, which continues to generate outstanding results for our clients; and we are further broadening our reach through deeper and new partnerships.\nFor Cigna Healthcare, we had sustained growth, leveraging the strength of our U.S. commercial, U.S. government and international health businesses. As we previously discussed, we also experienced elevated medical costs. We had higher claims costs in our commercial insured and stop-loss businesses and continued higher claims from our special enrollment Perry customers within the individual business.\nThese included the impact of elevated COVID costs for testing treatment of vaccines. The elevated trend continued throughout the year. As a result, our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was 84% for full year 2021. As Brian will discuss in further detail, we took targeted pricing and affordability actions earlier in 2021 for 2022 impact, as we continue to prioritize margin expansion for 2022.\nAs I highlighted earlier, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and EPS outlook and return over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders.\nLooking forward to 2022, we expect to continue to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities and achieve sustained attractive performance. We see additional opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Evernorth capabilities to respond to 3 forces that we believe are fundamentally reshaping the future of health care.\nThey are pharmacological innovation, the increased recognition of the link between mental and physical health; and third, the growing trend toward alternative sites of care. I'll start by highlighting how Evernorth will lead the way to capitalize on the first trend, pharmacological innovation.\nNew drugs represent one of the most promising areas for medical innovation in the coming years. And we're seeing good dramatic growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies and vaccines. These potentially life-saving and life-changing advances also bring intensifying pressures on affordability.\nThis creates significant opportunity for Evernorth to provide customers, patients and clients with the most innovative new therapies in ways that are accessible, affordable and predictable.\nBy 2025, for example, 66 biologic drugs currently in the market will have the patents expire, opening the door for increased biosimilar competition and an increasing opportunity to decrease health care spending by an estimated $100 billion.\nImportantly, this trend is already unfolding in 2022 and will accelerate further in 2023. We are positioned to lead and fully intend to capture a large portion of those savings for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients by combining and coordinating capabilities that include our Accredo capability, which provides differentiated specialty pharmacy care for a number of specific conditions.\nI'd also highlight that today, specialty pharmacy already drives only 1/3 of our North revenue, and Accredo is 1 of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio. Additionally, leveraging Express Scripts, which draws upon its expertise in delivering improved affordability, leveraging a broad network, supply chain expertise as well as clinical and service capabilities.\nManaging biologics and specialty drugs is also a priority focus for our Cigna Healthcare business. Last year, we launched an innovative program to leverage biosimilars in the medical benefit that included incentives that improve access for integrated clients and customers. This illustrates just one way we will continue to leverage Evernorth's capabilities to drive greater affordability and value for our Cigna Healthcare clients and customers.\nEvernorth will also continue to grow from the significant demand for more mental health services as well as the rapidly changing access to care models. For example, Evernorth is continuing to expand our virtual care services by leveraging our MDLIVE platform as well as expanding our behavioral care network.\nWe know how important it is for both patients as well as clients. Our Evernorth research reinforces that total health care costs decrease when people who are diagnosed with behavioral conditions receive coordinated, sustained treatment.\nFor Cigna Healthcare in 2022, we expect to drive customer growth in each of our U.S. commercial market segments and grow earnings as we continue executing on our affordability and pricing actions throughout 2022.\nAdditionally, Cigna Healthcare will continue to partner and leverage our Evernorth innovations. For example, we're continuing to expand digital experiences to help our customers connect with the highest performing and most affordable medical care.\nOur recent approach we developed for patients diagnosed with orthopedic and musculoskeletal conditions provide highly personalized and actionable information to guide their choices and support improved health care outcomes and affordability.\nIn the U.S. government business, as we've noted previously, we are operating in a more competitive environment stepping into 2022. For Cigna, aided by the strength of our broad portfolio, we've prioritized pricing discipline for U.S. government business for 2022.\nFor Medicare Advantage, we will start the year with flat membership. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident in our position to accelerate growth further, as our customer satisfaction metrics are high, our Star's ratings are very strong, and we steadily expanded our addressable market by entering new geographies.\nIn our Individual & Family Plan business, as noted previously, 2021 customers grew meaningfully in part due to the extended special enrollment period. We expect a decline in customers in 2022, in part driven by our product and price positioning that will adjust for the special enrollment surge we saw in 2021.\nWe do continue to view this as an attractive long-term opportunity. And to support that growth, we continue to enter new markets. For 2022, we entered 3 new states and 93 new counties.\nWith these markets, for example, we have the ability to reach an additional 1.5 million additional customers. In International Health, we are sharpening our focus, and we'll continue developing our services for the globally mobile as well as go deeper into domestic health and health services.\nOne of the key ways we will do this is with innovative partnerships such as Honeysuckle Health, an analytics-driven health service company establishing our joint venture with the nib Group in Australia. Now taken as a whole, 2022 will be another year of attractive growth for our company. our EPS outlook of at least [$22.40] and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 12% reinforces the sustained growth and strength of our businesses.\nNow before I wrap up, I want to reinforce a key aspect of our sustained performance is our positioning strategically to further expand our reach in addressable markets over time. Here, we will leverage organic partnerships and targeted inorganic opportunities to further strengthen our proven growth platforms.\nWe see 3 areas of continued focus here. First, in U.S. government, we will seek additional growth opportunities and our ability to win in these markets is further enhanced by our current and expanding Evernorth service capabilities.\nSecond, we will further expand our Evernorth service portfolio. This includes, for example, our Evernorth Care capabilities, including virtual home and behavioral services.\nAnd third, in International Health, our decision to divest our Life Accident Supplemental Benefits business in [7] markets reinforces our discipline to focus on the health portion of our portfolio.\nNow to wrap up. Looking back at 2021, our business performed in a dynamic environment. We delivered adjusted EPS of $20.47 and returned over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. 2022 will be another year of growth across our business, and we will continue to invest in innovation to position us for sustained long-term growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian C. Evanko\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Cigna Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter 2021 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2022. Key consolidated financial highlights for full year 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $174 billion or growth of 12% when adjusting for the sale of the Group Disability and Life business.\nAdjusted earnings of $7 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to $20.47. We delivered these results despite an elevated medical care ratio in the quarter. partly driven by COVID-19-related claims. Our enterprise revenue and EPS results were slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the resilience and breadth of our portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Evernorth.\nRegarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 15% to $35.1 billion, while adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in specialty pharmacy and retail, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability and deepening of existing relationships.\nIn the quarter, we also continued to increase the level of strategic investments to support ongoing growth of the Evernorth portfolio, such as our Accredo specialty pharmacy, our virtual care platform and our technology, including digital capabilities.\nOverall, Evernorth delivered a strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers, while achieving strong revenue and earnings growth above its long-term growth targets.\nTurning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes the prior U.S. Medical segment plus our retained International Health business. Overall, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, adjusted pretax earnings were $472 million and the medical care ratio was 87%.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we experienced elevated medical costs, driven in large part by dynamics related to COVID, including higher testing, treatment and vaccine costs, specifically the higher-than-expected fourth quarter costs are attributable to 3 primary areas: higher stop-loss claims, particularly in policies with lower attachment points that were triggered by the cumulative impact of COVID and non-COVID costs throughout the year; continued pressure on our individual business, particularly the special enrollment period customers who were added in mid-2021; and higher claim costs in our commercial insured book. The elevated medical costs were partly offset by better-than-expected net investment income and fee-based specialty contributions, neither of which are reflected in the medical care ratio metric.\nFor full year 2021, we finished with the medical care ratio of 84%. The unfavorable fourth quarter medical costs informed and sharpened our 2022 assumptions. We now expect full year 2022 medical costs to run above the corresponding 2022 baseline at a relative level that is consistent with full year 2021. This 2022 medical cost outlook is now higher than our previous expectations.\nIn specific to stop-loss, we assume the pressure experienced in the fourth quarter will persist in 2022, and we will take appropriate future pricing action as this book of business renews throughout the year. Helping to offset these pressures, as we step into 2022, our targeted pricing actions we've taken in our U.S. Commercial business as we saw claim costs emerge in 2021, higher U.S. commercial enrollment and retention than previously expected in our fee-based business and incremental affordability actions, which I'll elaborate on in just a few moments.\nTurning to membership. We ended the year with 17.1 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 430,000 customers for the full year. 2021 customer growth was driven by Middle Markets and Select within U.S. commercial, Individual and Medicare Advantage within U.S. government and International Health.\nOverall, Cigna Healthcare supported and delivered for our customers, clients and partners during a challenging year and is well positioned to both grow membership and expand margins in 2022.\nTurning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter adjusted loss was $115 million and now includes positive earnings contributions from our International Life Accident and Supplemental Benefits businesses held-for-sale pending divestiture. As Ralph noted, during the fourth quarter, we reported a special item charge of $119 million after tax related to actions to improve our organizational efficiency.\nThese actions will capitalize on our scale and the progress we have made through automation, increased use of digital tools and continued innovation to better enable us to grow and expand in this dynamic marketplace. Overall, Cigna's 2021 results reflect our balanced portfolio and our commitment to accretive capital deployment to augment our organic growth.\nAs we turn to 2022, our affordability initiatives, pricing actions and focus on operating efficiencies will drive income growth and margin expansion in Cigna Healthcare. This performance coupled with continued growth in Evernorth and accretive capital deployment, will drive attractive EPS growth.\nFor the full year 2022 outlook, I'd like to first remind you that our outlook assumes the divestiture of our International Life Accident and Supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of this year.\nIn total for the company, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $177 billion, representing growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact from previously announced divestitures.\nWe expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion or at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. We project an expense ratio in the range of 6.9% to 7.3%, further improving upon our operational efficiency and ensuring continued affordable solutions for our clients and customers. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%.\nI'll now discuss our 2022 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $6.1 billion. This represents growth of about 5% over 2021, within our targeted long-term income growth range, reflecting strong growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy, all while we continue to increase investments in order to drive new innovative solutions to the market.\nFor Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.9 billion. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business, driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing in order to expand margin.\nSome key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2022 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2022 growth of at least 575,000 customers with the vast majority coming from an increase in U.S. Commercial fee-based customers.\nWithin our U.S. commercial book, organic customer growth is driven by national, middle market and select market segments. We expect Medicare Advantage customers to be relatively flat compared to 2021, reflecting the competitive backdrop.\nAnd as David shared, we expect a decrease in our individual customers. We expect the 2022 medical care ratio to be in the range of 82% to 83.5%. As I noted earlier, this outlook assumes total medical costs will be above baseline in 2022. Importantly, we are actively managing overall medical costs with a range of affordability actions, including identifying opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care.\nFor example, we focused our Evercore subsidiary on an incorporating site of care review to our existing processes. These improvements encourage the use of non-hospital settings, which can substantially reduce cost for customers while increasing patient satisfaction. This action has contributed to results within our commercial book of business, where we are now seeing fewer than 20% of all knee and hip replacements occur in an inpatient hospital setting, down from over 75% in 2019.\nWe are also continuing to promote preventive care, the targeted use of virtual care through our MDLIVE subsidiary and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term.\nThrough these affordability initiatives and our disciplined pricing actions, we expect to expand margins in 2022, while growing our medical customer base. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we increase strategic reinvestment to support long-term growth and innovation.\nIn 2021, we finished the year with $7.2 billion of cash flow from operations. Additionally, we returned over $9 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in 2021, a significant increase from 2020. And now framing our capital outlook for 2022.\nWe expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations, up more than $1 billion from 2021, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing business. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities.\nWe expect to deploy approximately $1.25 billion to capital expenditures, an increase from our 2021 CapEx levels. The investments will be heavily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our meaningful quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share, a 12% increase on a per share basis.\nAnd we expect to use the proceeds from the divestiture of our International Life Accident and Supplemental benefits businesses, primarily for share repurchase. Our guidance assumes full year 2022 weighted average shares to be in the range of 308 million to 312 million shares. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2022, we have repurchased 2.5 million shares for $581 million.\nOur balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.\nSo now to recap. Our full year 2021 consolidated results reflect strong contributions from our focused growth platforms, led by Evernorth. Our 2022 outlook reflects meaningful contributions from each of our 2 largest segments, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, along with accretive capital deployment.\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver our 2022 full year adjusted earnings of at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. Finally, as Ralph noted, we are looking forward to speaking with you in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day in June. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."
